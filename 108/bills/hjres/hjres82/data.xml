  <summary>12/16/2003--Public Law.
Amends the law making continuing appropriations for FY 2004 (the law) to increase from $3.8 billion to $7.667 billion the limitation on new loan guarantee commitments of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), General and Special Risk Insurance Fund, for the period of applicability of the law. Allows such increase only: (1) after a certification by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to the congressional appropriations committees that the use of such authority will not result in loan guarantee commitments for all of FY 2004 at a level in excess of the limitation set forth in the FY 2003 appropriations Act, and that the apportionment of loan commitment authority provided for the Fund and the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund is in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the law; (2) if the authority for such increase applies only to new commitments issued after the enactment of this Act; and (3) if nothing in this Act is construed to pardon or release a Government officer or employee for violations of Federal law prohibiting an officer or employee from expending amounts in excess of appropriated amounts or expending sequestered amounts (the Antideficiency Act) or other applicable laws. Amends the law making continuing appropriations to provide a $141.4 million rate of operations for the Federal Aviation Administration Operations Account Staff Offices line of business.</summary>
