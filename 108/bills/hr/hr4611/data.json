    "text": "Gasoline Price Reduction and Refinery Tax Fairness Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to define \"oil and gas exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations or transmission facilities\" as all field activities or operations associated with exploration, production, processing, or treatment operations, or transmission facilities, including activities necessary to prepare a site for drilling and for the movement and placement of drilling equipment, whether or not such field activities or operations may be considered to be construction activities. Directs the President to establish the Office of Federal Energy Project Coordination (Office) within the Executive Office of the President. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) perform an internal review of Federal onshore oil and gas leasing and permitting practices; and (2) implement certain best management practices to ensure timely action on oil and gas leases and applications for permits to drill on lands otherwise available for leasing. Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to: (1) enter into a prescribed Memorandum of Understanding regarding oil and gas leasing on public lands; and (2) establish a joint data retrieval system and a joint Geographic Information System mapping system. Amends the Energy Act of 2000 to require the Secretary of the Interior's inventory of all Federal onshore lands to identify restrictions or impediments to oil and gas resource development of such lands. Directs each Federal agency head to require the agency, before it takes action that could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of domestic energy resources from Federal public land, to act in compliance with a certain Executive Order that identifies actions to expedite energy-related projects. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to set a deadline for expeditious consideration of applications for permits for oil and gas leases. Requires a Federal agency, in issuing any rule or order relating to gasoline production and distribution, to include a detailed analysis of the effects the rule or order would have on gasoline supply and seek to ensure that no rule or order is issued that will increase U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for accelerated depreciation for refinery machinery. Requires each Federal agency with the authority to do so to approve or disapprove (with specified explanations) within 180 days of its receipt any application for approval of an action affecting the siting or operation of U.S. refineries."
