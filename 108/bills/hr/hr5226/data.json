Permits producers with qualifying losses in both years to elect to receive payments in either, but not both, of such years. Makes producers ineligible for crop disaster assistance if they did not: (1) get Federal crop insurance for insurable commodities; and (2) file required paperwork and pay related fees for noninsurable commodities. Sets forth: (1) waiver provisions; and (2) payment limitations, including reductions for amounts received under the Florida Disaster Programs. Directs the Secretary to provide payments to livestock producers who have incurred 2003 or 2004 losses in an emergency-designated county, with discretionary set-asides for the American Indian livestock program. Permits producers with qualifying losses in both years to elect to receive payments in either, but not both, of such years. Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to commercial orchardists and tree farmers who have suffered losses during the December 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004 period. Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to emergency conservation program participants. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to limit Commodity Credit Corporation amounts available for the conservation security program for FY 2005 through 2014."
