  <summary>6/19/2003--Introduced.
Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2003 - Directs the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to: (1) develop a program (including suitable warnings) to deter members of the public from committing acts of copyright infringement by offering on the Internet copies of copyrighted works, or making copies of copyrighted works from the Internet, without the authorization of the copyright owners; and (2) facilitate the sharing among law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, and copyright owners of information concerning such activities. Requires the Attorney General to ensure that: (1) any unit in the Department of Justice responsible for investigating computer hacking or responsible for investigating intellectual property crimes is assigned at least one agent to support such unit for the purpose of investigating crimes relating to the theft of intellectual property; and (2) each agent so assigned has received training in the investigation and enforcement of intellectual property crimes. Establishes within the Office of the Associate Attorney General of the United States an Internet Use Education Program. Amends Federal copyright law to make importation into the United States without the copyright owner's authorization of copies and phonorecords of a work that have been acquired outside the United State an infringement of the exclusive right to distribute such copies or phonorecords, regardless of whether that work has been registered with the Copyright Office or recorded with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) of the Department of Homeland Security. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service to make regulations prohibiting such importations regardless of registration with the Copyright Office or recordation with the BCBP. Directs the Attorney General to set forth criteria under which copyright owners designated by the Attorney General will be able to use the FBI seal for deterrent purposes in connection with physical and digital copies and phonorecords and digital transmission of their works of authorship.</summary>
