Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to carry out a program for the protection, assessment, monitoring, and study of the health and safety of individuals if chemicals or substances associated with potential acute or chronic human health effects (substances of concern) are being or have been released in a disaster area. Makes participation in any registry or study that is part of the program voluntary. Requires the President to take appropriate measures to protect the privacy of registry or study participants. Authorizes the President to carry out such a program through a cooperative agreement with a medical institution (including a local health department) or a consortium of medical institutions. Requires the President to carry out such a program in accordance with certain privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to enter jointly into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study and report on disaster area health and environmental protection and monitoring. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to extend through September 30, 2006, the President's authority to establish a program to provide technical and financial assistance to State and local governments for the implementation of cost-effective predisaster hazard mitigation measures."
