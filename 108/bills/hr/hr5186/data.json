    "text": "Taxpayer-Teacher Protection Act of 2004 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to reduce certain special allowance payments to holders of student loans. Sets a quarterly rate of special allowance for holders of loans that meet certain criteria. Includes among such criteria that such loans be: (1) financed through tax-exempt securities that have matured or been retired or defeased after September 30, 2004, and before January 1, 2006 (the period); (2) refinanced during the period with funds from another source; or (3) sold or transferred to any other holder during the period. (Sec. 3) Revises HEA to require all teachers eligible for student loan forgiveness to be highly qualified, in keeping with requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). Exempts from this requirement teachers who have already begun their teaching service obligation under the current loan forgiveness program. States that such exemption shall not apply for purposes of obtaining certain increased amounts of student loan forgiveness. Provides for such additional amounts of student loan forgiveness for certain eligible teachers of: (1) mathematics or science in secondary schools; and (2) special education in elementary and secondary schools. Increases to $17,500 the maximum amount of loan forgiveness for such teachers under the Federal Family Education Loan and the Federal Direct Student Loan programs (with the current maximum of $5,000 continuing to apply to eligible elementary and secondary teachers of other subjects). Directs the Secretary to notify local educational agencies eligible to participate in the ESEA's Small Rural Achievement Program of the increased amounts of student loan forgiveness made available to certain teachers by this Act, and to encourage such agencies to notify their teachers of such benefits."
