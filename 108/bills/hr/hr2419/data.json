Prohibits undertakings likely to cause significant damage to Indian sacred lands.Grants Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations the right to petition the department or agency with administrative jurisdiction to have Federal lands designated as unsuitable for certain undertakings. Permits appeals through the Federal agency appeals board or in U. S. district courts. Provides relief through monetary damages, injunctions, or mandamus.Provides for the withdrawal of lands determined to be unsuitable. Requires Federal land use plans to be modified accordingly. Protects the confidentiality of information in a petition as it pertains to traditional cultural practice, religion, or the significance and location of sacred land. Establishes criminal penalties for violations of such confidentiality. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make grants to assist Indian tribes in activities under this Act (including the acquisition or management of sacred lands deemed unsuitable for undertaking under this Act). Authorizes the head of the department or agency with administrative jurisdiction over Federal sacred land to enter into cooperative agreements with tribes and take the land into trust for the benefit of the Indian tribe if the tribe manages the land to protect its sacredness.
