Includes among areas to be given preference areas: (1) where regional sediment management plans have been adopted; and (2) that promote human health and safety and the quality of life. Directs the Secretary of the Army to pay the Federal cost share of carrying out beach nourishment projects and research that encourages the protection, restoration, and enhancement of shores, sandy beaches, and other coastal infrastructure. Sets forth revised provisions regarding the Federal cost share, which shall be equal for beach erosion control projects for purposes of recreation or for storm damage protection or environmental restoration. Directs the Secretary, at the request of a non-Federal interest and with congressional approval, to extend the period of Federal participation in certain beach nourishment projects."
