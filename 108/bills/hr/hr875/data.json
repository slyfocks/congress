The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)Over-the-Road Bus Security and Safety Act of 2003 - (Sec. 2) Directs the Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, to establish a program to make grants to private operators of over-the-road buses for specified system-wide security improvements to their operations, including the reimbursement of extraordinary security-related costs incurred since September 11, 2001.(Sec. 3) Sets forth certain grant requirements, including requiring: (1) an applicant private operator of over-the-road buses to submit to the Secretary a security improvements plan; and (2) an applicant for a grant for security improvements within a terminal owned and operated by an entity other than the applicant to demonstrate to the Secretary that such applicant has coordinated such improvements for the terminal with the entity.(Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees a preliminary report that includes an assessment of: (1) the over-the-road bus security grant program; (2) actions already taken to address identified security issues by both public and private entities, together with any recommendations for additional safety and security enforcement actions; (3) the economic impact that security upgrades of buses and bus facilities may have on the over-the-road bus transportation industry and its employees; (4) ongoing research, including engine shut-off mechanisms, chemical and biological weapon detection technology, and the feasibility of compartmentalizing the driver; (5) industry best practices to enhance security; and (6) any need for additional legislation.(Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 and 2004."
