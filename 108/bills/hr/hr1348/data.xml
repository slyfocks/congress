  <summary>3/19/2003--Introduced.
Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2003 - Prohibits the Federal Government or any contractors or subcontractors from participating in the practice of bid shopping with respect to any Government contract exceeding $1 million for the construction or repair of any public building or public work. Defines "bid shopping" as the practice of divulging a contractor's or subcontractor's bid or proposal or requiring a contractor or subcontractor to divulge its bid or proposal to another prospective contractor before the award of a contract or subcontract in order to secure a lower bid or proposal.Requires any invitation for bid or request for proposal issued by the Government to include a clause explicitly prohibiting such practice and specifying penalties, which may include: (1) contract termination and imposition of liquidated damages equal to three times the final bid; and (2) debarment or suspension for multiple violations.</summary>
