  <summary>4/3/2003--Introduced.
Teacher Mentoring Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to authorize the Secretary of Education to make competitive three-year grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish or implement teacher mentoring programs to guide and assist new teachers and improve teacher quality.Requires such programs to provide: (1) training and stipends for mentors; (2) mentoring programs for teachers in their first year of teaching; and (3) regular and ongoing opportunities for mentors and mentees to observe each other's teaching methods in classroom settings during the school day. Requires such programs to establish: (1) minimum qualifications for mentors; and (2) an evaluation and accountability plan for, and report on, program activities.Requires LEAs, in using such program grants, to prioritize funding for mentoring activities at elementary and secondary schools which the LEA identifies under ESEA as failing to make adequate yearly progress.Directs the Secretary to: (1) award at least 50 percent of such grants to low-income LEAs; and (2) report to Congress on program results, including impact on teacher retention rates.</summary>
