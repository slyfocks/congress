  <summary>1/20/2004--Introduced.
Declares an employer liable to a party injured in a crime of violence motivated by gender if: (1) the employer's business is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce; and (2) the employer's negligent conduct results in the perpetration of a gender-motivated crime of violence against an individual upon premises under the employer's control. Directs the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to create and provide to employers materials regarding personnel policies and safety standards to assist them in avoiding liability under this Act.</summary>
