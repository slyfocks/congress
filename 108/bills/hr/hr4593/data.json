Lincoln County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2004 - Title I: Land Disposal - (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct sales of certain acreage of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) managed public land in Lincoln County, Nevada.

Withdraws such land from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under the public land laws, including the mining laws, with a specified exception; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws. (Sec. 103) Requires certain percentages of the proceeds from the sale of such land to be disbursed as follows: (1) to the State of Nevada for general education (five percent); (2) to Lincoln County for fire protection, law enforcement, public safety, housing, social services, and transportation (ten percent); and (3) remaining amounts to the Treasury for land management activities.

Prohibits the President or any other federal officer, agent, or employee, after the date of enactment of this Act, from developing any new water resource facility within the wilderness areas. (Sec. 205) Declares that Congress does not intend for the designation of wilderness to lead to the creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around such wilderness. Permits nonwilderness activities outside the boundary of a wilderness zone even if such activities can be seen or heard from within the wilderness zone. (Sec. 206) States that nothing in this title restricts or precludes military overflights, flight testing and evaluation, or the designation or creation of new units of special use airspace, or the establishment of military flight training routes, over the wilderness areas. (Sec. 207) States that nothing in this title shall be construed to diminish the rights of any Indian tribe or access to Federal land for tribal activities. (Sec. 208) Declares that the following areas have been adequately studied for wilderness designation: (1) the Table Mountain Wilderness Study Area; (2) Evergreen A, B, and C Wilderness Study Areas; and (3) certain other lands in Lincoln County, Nevada.

Authorizes the Secretary to ban hunting, fishing, and trapping in the wilderness areas for public safety reasons. (Sec. 210) Permits certain governmental wildfire management operations in the wilderness area. (Sec. 211) Permits the installation and maintenance of essential hydrologic, meteorologic, or climatological collection devices in the wilderness areas Title III: Utility Corridors - (Sec. 301) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish on public land a 2,640-foot wide corridor for utilities in Lincoln and Clark Counties, Nevada; and (2) grant certain nonexclusive rights-of-way to the Southern Nevada Water Authority and the Lincoln County Water District for the construction and operation of a water conveyance system; (3) conduct a study of water resources in White Pine and Lincoln Counties, Nevada, and in adjacent areas in Utah.
