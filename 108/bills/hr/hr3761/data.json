Requires each Federal agency to include in budget documents submitted in FY 2005 a list of programs within that agency that are unnecessary, together with recommendations for appropriate action. Expresses the sense of Congress that, following submission of the Commission's report, the House of Representatives and the Senate should promptly consider legislation that would enact changes in Federal statutes necessary to implement the Commission's recommendations."
