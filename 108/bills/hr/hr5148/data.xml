  <summary>9/24/2004--Introduced.
Identity Management Security Act of 2004 - Prohibits a Federal agency from accepting a State issued driver's license or identification card unless it includes certain data, including a photograph, a common machine-readable technology, and certain anti-fraud physical security features. Prescribes minimum license or identification card issuance standards and other specified practices States must meet. Requires a State, to be eligible for a grant to assist it in conforming to such minimum standards, to participate in the interstate compact, "Driver License Agreement," in order to provide electronic access by a State to information contained in the motor vehicle databases of all other States. Requires the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the security of birth certificates and other birth documentation used by States as proof of identity, with recommendations on measures to improve the security of such documentation. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States to assist them in eliminating the duplication of birth and death records.</summary>
