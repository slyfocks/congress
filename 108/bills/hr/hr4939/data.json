Establishes within the KIDS Account Fund a Kids Investment and Development Savings Account (KIDS Account). Provides that a U.S. citizen born after December 31, 2005, and under 18 years of age, whose modified adjusted gross income is below the applicable national median adjusted gross income amount, is eligible to contribute to such account and to receive a matching Federal contribution. Establishes the KIDS Account Fund Board to establish a default investment program under which, in a manner similar to a lifecycle investment program, sums in each KIDS Account are allocated to investment funds in the KIDS Account Fund based on the amount of time before the account holder attains the age of 18. Subjects the Board to the same statutory composition requirements, duties, and responsibilities as the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, to develop programs to promote the financial literacy of account holders of KIDS Accounts."
