Allows employers a refundable credit against payroll taxes for wages paid to employees who are first responders (i.e., law enforcement officials, firefighters, paramedics, and Ready Reserve-National Guard employees). Allows employers a tax credit for 50 percent of the lesser of: (1) the wages paid to each employee hired to replace a Ready Reserve-National Guard employee or self-employed Reservist while on active duty; or (2) $12,000. Increases the amount of the credit for certain U.S. manufacturers. Disqualifies an employer for the tax credit if the employer has failed to comply with employment or reemployment rights of military personnel."
