    "text": "PRIDE Plus Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to establish a program to provide environmental assistance to non-Federal interests in specified counties in northern and northeastern Kentucky. Permits such assistance to be in the form of design and construction assistance for publicly owned water-related environmental infrastructure and resource protection and development projects, including projects for wastewater treatment, water supply, environmental restoration, and surface water resource protection and development. Requires the Secretary to enter into a local cooperation agreement with a non-Federal interest to provide for design and construction of a project, which provides for: (1) development by the Secretary of a facilities or resource protection and development plan; and (2) establishment of legal and institutional structures to ensure the effective long-term operation of the project by the non-Federal interest. Sets the Federal share of the project costs under each local cooperation agreement at 75 percent. Directs that the non-Federal interest receive specified credit for design work, interest, land, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations. Sets the non-Federal share of project operation and maintenance costs at 100 percent."
