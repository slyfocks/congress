    "text": "Safe Disposal of Low-Level Radioactive Waste Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the Department of Energy (DOE) from disposing any low-level radioactive waste in a landfill that does not meet all requirements and standards applicable to landfills containing hazardous waste under either Federal law, or under a State regulatory program, with respect to landfill lining, leachate collection systems, and groundwater and soil column monitoring systems. Declares such prohibition inapplicable to DOE disposal of certain sealed reactor compartments and reactor components from Naval nuclear-powered warships and prototypes where a performance assessment or analysis in an environmental impact statement demonstrates that the sealed nature of the metal compartment or reactor component will significantly outlast and exceed performance standards for a liner system."
