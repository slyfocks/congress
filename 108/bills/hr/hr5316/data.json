Requires the initial period of designation to remain in effect for 18 months beginning on the date of enactment of this Act. Limits eligibility for TPS under this Act to aliens who: (1) have been continuously physically present in the United States since September 7, 2004; (2) are admissible as immigrants or eligible for certain waivers of inadmissibility and are not ineligible for TPS; and (3) register for TPS in the manner established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Directs the Secretary to give prior consent to travel abroad to an alien granted TPS pursuant to this Act if the alien establishes that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad."
