  <summary>9/16/2003--Introduced.
Graduation for All Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish a program that will provide grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) and, through them, subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish reading and writing programs to improve overall reading and writing performance among students in secondary schools, including middle and high schools. Limits eligibility for subgrants to LEAs in a State that are among those that have the lowest graduation rates for public secondary school students. Includes among required uses of LEA subgrant funds: (1) hiring and inservice training of literacy coaches to work with classroom teachers to incorporate reading and writing instruction in all subject areas, and to identify students with reading problems and provide remediation or referral for additional services; (2) counseling for students at risk of not graduating on time; and (3) professional development for middle and high school teachers, administrators, and paraprofessionals that addresses literacy needs of economically disadvantaged students, students from major racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, students with limited English proficiency, migrant children, and homeless children. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include public secondary school graduation rates for all students under requirements for: (1) accountability for adequate yearly progress; and (2) annual State report cards. Amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act to require annual reports on the number participants who are 16, 17, or 18 years of age in certain programs and services, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, limited English proficiency status, disability, and socioeconomic status.</summary>
