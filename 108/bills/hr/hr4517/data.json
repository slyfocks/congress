(Sec. 5) Designates the Department of Energy (DOE) as Lead Agency for coordinating Federal authorizations and related environmental reviews of the facility upon request of an applicant for a Federal authorization related to the siting and operation of a refinery facility within a Refinery Revitalization Zone. Instructs the Secretary to coordinate the Federal authorization and review process with any Indian Tribes and State and local agencies responsible for conducting any separate permitting and environmental reviews of the facility. Directs DOE, as lead agency, to prepare a single environmental review document to be used as the basis for all decisions on the proposed project. Sets forth an appeals process in the event the Federal authorization required for a refinery facility within a Refinery Revitalization Zone has been either denied, or an agency has failed to act by the deadline established by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary and the appropriate heads of Federal agencies to enter into Memoranda of Understanding to ensure timely, coordinated review and permitting of refinery facilities within a Refinery Revitalization Zone. Permits interested Indian Tribes and State and local agencies to enter into such Memoranda as well."
