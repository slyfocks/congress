  <summary>3/31/2003--Passed House amended.
Northern Ireland Peace and Reconciliation Support Act of 2003 - Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. assistance for the International Fund for Ireland has contributed greatly to the economic development of Northern Ireland and that both objectives of the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986, economic development and reconciliation, remain critical to achieving a just and lasting peace in the region, especially in the economically-depressed areas; and (2) Fund contributions to support much-needed projects in economically-depressed areas of Northern Ireland remain very important, and an expansion of efforts in reconciliation projects is encouraged.Amends the Anglo-Irish Agreement Support Act of 1986 to encourage the Fund to support programs that: (1) enhance relations between communities, and between the police and the communities they serve; (2) promote human rights training for police; (3) enhance peaceful mediation in neighborhoods of continued conflict; (4) promote training programs to enhance the new district partnership police boards recommended by the Patten Commission; and (5) assist in the transition of former British military installations and prisons into sites for peaceful, community-supported activities, such as housing, retail, and commercial development.Authorizes certain appropriations for FY 2004 and 2005 for U.S. contributions to the Fund. Declares the sense of Congress that at least 20 percent of such amount for each such fiscal year should be used to carry out such programs to improve local community relations and relations between the police and the people they serve.</summary>
