    "text": "George E. Brown, Jr. and Robert S. Walker Hydrogen Future Act of 2003 - Amends the Spark M. Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 to direct the Secretary of Energy to conduct a research, development, demonstration, and commercial application program on: (1) accelerated uses of hydrogen and related technologies in stationary and transportation applications; and (2) advanced vehicle technologies (FreedomCAR program). Requires the FreedomCAR program to address: (1) engine and emission control systems; (2) energy storage, electric propulsion, and hybrid systems; (3) automotive materials; (4) clean fuels in addition to hydrogen; and (5) other advanced vehicle technologies. Requires the Secretary to transmit to Congress a coordinated plan for such programs and any other DOE programs directly related to fuel cells or hydrogen. Authorizes the Secretary to implement programs for: (1) interagency, intergovernmental, and international education, information exchange, and cooperation concerning hydrogen and hydrogen-related products; and (2) a technology transfer to the private sector to foster the exchange of generic, nonproprietary information and technology developed under this Act. Directs the President to establish an interagency task force to work toward development of: (1) a safe, economical, and environmentally sound hydrogen infrastructure; (2) uniform hydrogen codes, standards, and safety protocols; (3) fuel cells in government applications; and (4) vehicle hydrogen fuel system integrity safety performance. Replaces the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel with the Hydrogen Technical and Fuel Cell Advisory Committee. Authorizes DOE to represent U.S. interests regarding activities and programs under this Act before governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including: (1) other Federal, State, regional, and local governments; (2) industry representatives, including the energy and transportation industries; and (3) in consultation with the Department of State, foreign governments and international organizations. Repeals the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996."
