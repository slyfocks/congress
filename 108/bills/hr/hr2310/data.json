Authorizes a grant to a State to carry out an assessment project to: (1) identify harmful nonnative species occurring in the State; (2) assess the needs to restore, manage, or enhance native fish and wildlife and their natural habitats and processes; (3) identify priorities for actions to address such needs; (4) identify mechanisms to increase capacity building in a State or across State lines to conserve and protect native fish and wildlife and their habitats and to detect and control harmful nonnative species within the State; and (5) incorporate, where applicable, the guidelines of the National Management Plan referred to in Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999, and entitled Meeting the Invasive Species Challenge. Authorizes the Secretary to assist financially a rapid response to outbreaks of harmful nonnative species when rapid eradication or control is possible. Establishes: (1) the National Invasive Species Council to provide leadership and coordination among Federal agencies, and between the Federal Government and State and local governments; and (2) the Invasive Species Advisory Committee."
