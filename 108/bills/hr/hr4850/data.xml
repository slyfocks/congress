Repeals the grant to a teacher employed at a D.C. Public school that converts to a public charter school of the option to remain at the charter school during the school's first year of operation after receiving an extended leave of absence, and thereafter at the charter school's sole discretion. Modifies the requirement that the Mayor and the D.C. government give a right of first offer with respect to any facility or property not previously (or under contract to be) disposed of to an eligible applicant whose petition to establish a public charter school is conditionally approved. Repeals the mandatory annual reinstatement of such right. Extends the restriction on the exercise of such right with respect to certain facilities or properties to exclude any facility or property that is: (1) the subject of a previously proposed resolution submitted to the D.C. Council by the Mayor on or before December 1, 2004, seeking authority for disposition of such facility or property; or (2) under an Exclusive Rights Agreement executed on or before such date. Modifies the terms of purchase or lease of such a facility or property to require the Mayor to negotiate in accordance with written rules or regulations as determined by the Mayor, and published in the District of Columbia Register.

Requires, instead, that such rent or acquisition price, as applicable, be at the appraised value of the property, based on its use for school purposes. Grants a D.C. Public school approved to become a conversion public charter school the right to occupy the facilities exclusively under a minimum 25-year lease, renewable for additional 25-year periods as long as the school maintains its charter at the appraised value of the property based on its use for school purposes (in lieu of maintaining its charter at the nonprofit rate, or if there is no nonprofit rate, at 25 percent less than the fair market rate for school use).) (Sec. 343) Requires an eligible chartering authority to ensure that each public charter school complies with annual reporting requirements, including submission of the audited financial statement.

(Sec. 344) Requires the Director of the National Park Service (NPS), acting on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior, to transfer to the District government, without consideration, and for public recreational use only, jurisdiction of a portion of specified NPs land in Anacostia Park which includes the Kenilworth Parkside Community Center (currently occupied under permit by the District) and all of U.S. Reservation 523.

Council, the appropriate congressional committees, and the CFO. Grants such Board the authority to solicit, award, and execute contracts independently of the Office of Contracting and Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer. Provides that nothing in the District of Columbia Code regarding procurement shall affect the Board's authority under this Act.
