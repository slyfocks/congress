    "as": "Reported to House amended",

    "text": "Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2004 - (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to establish a program of grants for pilot projects to explore the integrated use of sources of remote sensing and other geospatial information to address State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. Requires the Administrator, in awarding grants, to give preference to specified types of projects. Requires the Administrator to seek opportunities to assist: (1) in the development of commercial applications potentially available from the remote sensing industry; (2) State, local, regional, and tribal agencies in applying remote sensing and geospatial information technologies for growth management; and (3) such agencies in obtaining and utilizing satellite, aviation, and sensor capabilities for wildland fire detection, analysis, and observation. Limits the provision of assistance for a project to three years. Requires each grant recipient to: (1) report project results to the Administrator; and (2) conduct at least one workshop for potential users to disseminate the lessons learned from the project. (Sec. 5) Requires the Administrator to establish an advisory committee to monitor the program. Instructs the advisory committee to consult with the Federal Geographic Data Committee and other industry representatives and organizations. Requires the Administrator to transmit to Congress an independent evaluation of program effectiveness. (Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to ensure that project results are retrievable through an Internet-accessible database. (Sec. 7) Requires the Administrator to establish an educational outreach program to increase awareness at institutions of higher education and State, local, regional, and tribal agencies of the potential applications of remote sensing and geospatial information. (Sec. 8) Requires the Administrator to study and transmit results to Congress on the effect of remote sensing imagery costs on potential State, local, regional, and tribal agency applications. Requires such study to identify applications that are likely to be most affected by reductions in the cost of remote sensing imagery. (Sec. 9) Directs NASA to submit a report to Congress on how agencies are implementing recommendations contained in the General Accounting Office report entitled \"Geospatial Information: Technologies Hold Promise for Wildland Fire Management, but Challenges Remain\" (September 2003). (Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations."
