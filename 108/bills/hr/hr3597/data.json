Requires the Secretary to: (1) transmit a report on study results to specified congressional committees, including appropriate cost-sharing options for project implementation based upon the use and possible allocation of any stored water; and (2) use information supplied by the El Dorado Irrigation District in developing such report. Limits the Federal share of the costs of the study to 50 percent. Allows the Secretary to accept in-kind services by the District as part of the non-Federal cost share. Authorizes appropriations."
