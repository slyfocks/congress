  <summary>1/28/2004--Introduced.
Tribal and Local Communities Relationship Improvement Act - Amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to make invalid any tribal-State compact entered into after the enactment of this Act unless it is approved by the Governor and legislature of the State with which the compact was negotiated (with an exception for compact renewals that do not expand covered gambling operations). Requires approval by a State legislature (as well as by the State Governor, as under current law) of Indian gaming as regulated under such Act on lands acquired in trust by the Secretary of the Interior after October 17, 1988. Prohibits the conduct of class III gaming on more than one parcel of land of an Indian tribe (unless under valid existing Tribal-State compacts, but on no more parcels than those on which gaming is conducted on the date of enactment of this Act). Directs the President to establish the Advisory Committee on Minimum Regulatory Requirements and Licensing Standards for Indian Gaming. Requires Committee recommendations to be submitted to specified congressional committees, the National Indian Gaming Commission, and each federally recognized Indian tribe. Establishes the Commission on Native American Policy to study and report to Congress on living standards in Indian country, including health, infrastructure, economic development, educational opportunities, housing, crime control on Indian reservations, the influence of organized crime on Indian gaming, and other specified matters.</summary>
