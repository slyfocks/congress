  <summary>7/14/2004--Reported to House without amendment.
(Sec. 1) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in order to facilitate the administration of Yosemite National Park, to expend donated funds, funds collected from user fees, or appropriated funds for the planning, design, construction of, and related activities for, essential facilities for Park and concessions administration and visitor use outside the boundaries, but within the vicinity, of the Park. Requires that such facilities and their use conform with approved plans for the Park. Permits the construction of such facilities only upon a finding that they are necessary for Park operation and that the location of such facilities would: (1) avoid undue degradation of natural or cultural resources within the Park; (2) enhance service to the public; or (3) provide a cost saving to the Federal Government. Allows the Secretary to enter into agreements with local governments or private entities to undertake such activities. Encourages the Secretary to identify and use alternative funding sources to supplement any Federal funding used for these facilities. (Sec. 2) Instructs the Secretary to allocate such amounts to carry out: (1) planning and restoration of low-impact camping at upper and lower river campgrounds; (2) construction and maintenance of the maximum amount of parking available at Camp 6 and adjacent previously impacted lands; (3) cooperation and participation (including the provision of technical and financial assistance) with county governments located in the Park's vicinity for the preparation of county general and specific plans related to determining the feasibility of locating park administrative facilities, visitor services and facilities, housing, or other facilities necessary for Park operations outside of the Park; (4) consistent with the projects described in the preceding clauses, development of traffic management and traveler information services, signage, and circulation improvements; (5) provision of housing for employees of the Government and employees of Park concessionaires who are required as a condition of their employment to reside in Yosemite Valley; (6) entering into and carrying out cooperative agreements with the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System Joint Powers Authority to transport such employees to and from the Park; and (7) removal of the Le Conte Memorial from the Park and restoration of the grounds of that Memorial to their natural state. Bars the Secretary from allocating amounts made available for the planning, design, construction of, and related activities for, essential facilities for Park and concessions administration and visitor use to implement a shuttle system that uses remote parking facilities or includes operations outside of the boundaries of Yosemite Valley.</summary>
