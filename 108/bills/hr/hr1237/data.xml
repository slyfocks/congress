Directs the Secretary to make grants for such pre- and in-service training and development.Directs the Secretary to commission the National Academy of Sciences to: (1) develop a model meaning for developmental delay for States to use in establishing early intervention services under part C; and (2) estimate the percentage of each State's population who would receive such services if the model were adopted.Requires the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council under IDEA to study and report on mechanisms for providing service coordination from birth through age five for infants, toddlers, and children served under part C and preschool grant provisions.</summary>
