Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act - (Sec. 3) Amends the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the President to appoint a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who is to report directly to the Secretary of DHS and to the Under Secretary for Management. Removes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) from the list of agencies required to have a CFO. (Sec. 4) Amends the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 to instruct the Secretary of DHS to: (1) submit a specified performance and accountability report, including an audit opinion of DHS internal controls over its financial reporting; and (3) design and implement DHS-wide management controls that reflect the national homeland security strategy of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and that permit assessment by Congress and DHS managers of DHS performance in executing such strategy. Requires performance and accountability reports for fiscal years after 2005 to include an assertion of the internal controls that apply to financial reporting by the DHS. (Sec. 5) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Future Years Homeland Security Program to: (1) include the same type of information, organizational structure, and level of detail as a certain future years defense program; (2) set forth the homeland security strategy that was used to develop program planning guidance for the Program; and (3) include an explanation of how the resource allocations included in the Program correlate to homeland security strategy. (Sec. 6) Instructs the Secretary to establish an Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation. Creates the position of Director of Program Analysis and Evaluation. (Sec. 7) Requires the CFO of DHS to notify simultaneously specified congressional committees whenever appropriations earmarked for DHS are either transferred or reprogrammed.</summary>
