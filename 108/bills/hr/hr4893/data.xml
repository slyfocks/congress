Directs the Secretary: (1) upon identifying a Bureau facility for modification, to provide to the beneficiaries written notice describing the need and the identifying and implementing process for the modification and summarizing the administrative and legal requirements; (2) to provide beneficiaries an opportunity to consult with the Bureau on the planning, design, and construction of the proposed modification and to develop and provide time frames for the consultation; (3) prior to submitting required reports, to consider any alternative submitted in writing by a beneficiary that has elected to consult with the Bureau; and (4) to provide to the beneficiary a timely written response describing any proposed actions to address the recommendation.
