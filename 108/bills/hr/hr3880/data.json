    "text": "Internet Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to prohibit any person from dispensing a prescription drug pursuant to a sale if: (1) any part of the sales transaction for the drug is conducted through an Internet site; and (2) such site fails to meet specified requirements regarding inclusion of a page (and links thereto) providing the identities and licensing information of the seller, pharmacists, or medical consultants. Prohibits a person from selling or dispensing a prescription drug if: (1) the purchaser communicated with the person through the Internet; (2) the purchaser did not have a valid prescription when the communication began; (3) the person provided for the involvement of a practitioner; (4) the practitioner issued a prescription for the drug that was purchased; (5) the person knew that no qualifying medical relationship existed (defines \"qualifying medical relationship\" as requiring an in-person medical evaluation); and (6) the person received payment. Allows States to bring civil actions against a person for violations of this Act. Prevents Internet providers from being held liable for dispensing or selling prescriptions drugs on account of another person's activities. Includes the dispensing or selling of a prescription drug in violation of this Act as a prohibited act under the FFDCA. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award a grant or contract to the National Clearinghouse on Internet Prescribing to identify and report Internet sites that violate Federal or State laws concerning the dispensing of drugs."
