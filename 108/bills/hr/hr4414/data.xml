Strengthening Homeland Innovation to Emphasize Liberty, Democracy, and Privacy Act or SHIELD Privacy Act - Directs the President to designate a senior official within the Office of Management and Budget as the Chief Privacy Officer, who shall have primary responsibility for privacy policy throughout the Federal Government. Directs the head of each department and independent agency in the executive branch to appoint a senior official of the department or independent agency, respectively, to assure primary responsibility for privacy policy. Requires the official appointed for the department or independent agency to: (1) assess the impact on privacy of each proposed action of the Department or agency that will require collecting, using, or accessing personally identifiable information from ten or more persons; and (2) make the results of such assessments publicly available through the Department's web site. Establishes the Commission on Privacy, Freedom, and Homeland Security to conduct a legal and factual study relating to U.S. efforts to further homeland security in a manner that protects privacy, civil liberties, and individual freedoms. Requires the Commission to: (1) conduct at least two field hearings in the five geographical regions of the United States; and (2) appoint a Director. Instructs the Commission to arrange with the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences for assistance in studying specified matters respecting such study, including the impact of Federal legislation enacted since September 11, 2001, or pending before Congress, on civil liberties. Terminates the Commission 30 days after the Commission submits a report of its findings, recommendations, and conclusions.</summary>
