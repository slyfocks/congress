    "text": "Federal Government Energy Management Improvement Act - Title I: Federal Facilities - (Sec. 101) Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to prescribe energy reduction goals in Federal buildings through FY 2013. Authorizes a Federal agency to exclude a Federal building from such energy performance and specified energy management requirements if the agency has submitted all federally required energy management reports, has achieved compliance with certain energy efficiency requirements, and has implemented all practicable, life cycle cost-effective projects with respect to the building. Extends the current exemption from energy consumption requirements for impracticability to include as a basis energy intensiveness or the performance of a national security function.Permits Federal agencies to retain any funds appropriated for energy expenditures, at buildings subject to specified energy management requirements, that are not made because of energy savings. Restricts the use of such funds to energy efficiency or unconventional and renewable energy resources projects.(Sec. 102) Prescribes guidelines for mandatory hourly metering and submetering of Federal buildings by October 1, 2010.(Sec. 103) Repeals sunset and reporting requirements pertaining to Federal agency authority to enter into energy savings performance contracts (thereby granting such authority permanent status).Permits aggregate annual payments by an agency under an energy savings contract or energy savings performance contract to take into account savings resulting from reduced costs of operation and maintenance accomplished through replacing existing facilities with new (more efficient) facilities.(Sec. 104) Encourages Federal agency participation in State or regional demand side reduction programs.Title II: Federal Fleets - (Sec. 201) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to allow the Secretary of Energy to waive the requirement governing Federal agency use of alternative fuel use in light duty Federal vehicles in a particular geographic area where the alternative fuel is not reasonably available to retail purchasers, or the cost is unreasonably more expensive than the cost of gasoline.(Sec. 202) Directs the Administrator of General Services to study and report to specified congressional committees on the merits of establishing performance measures to guide the reduction of petroleum consumption by Federal fleets.(Sec. 203) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to declare that, if an agency chooses not to acquire available future technology vehicles while it is operating its fleet under the Secretary's waiver, the agency's acquisition of dual fueled (hybrid) vehicles shall not count toward satisfaction of its mandate to use alternative fueled vehicle fuels.Title III: Federal Procurement - (Sec. 301) Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to prescribe guidelines for Federal procurement of energy efficient products (Energy Star and Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) designated products) and to require their listing in Federal catalogs.(Sec. 302) Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require increased use of recovered mineral component in federally funded projects involving procurement of cement or concrete.(Sec. 303) Expresses the sense of Congress that an Alaska natural gas transportation project will provide significant economic benefits to the United States and Canada. Urges the sponsors of the pipeline project to maximize the participation of small business concerns in contracts and subcontracts awarded in carrying out the project.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the extent to which small business concerns participate in the construction of oil and gas pipelines in the United States.(Sec. 304) Amends the Buy Indian Act to authorize Federal agencies to purchase Indian energy products and by-products.(Sec. 305) Expresses the sense of Congress that no purchase of supplies, other than for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public building or public work in the United States, should be made from a person or entity found in violation of a certificate provided by the person or entity pursuant to the Buy American Act.Title IV: Federal Workers - (Sec. 401) Requires the Secretary to study and report to the President and Congress on the energy conservation implications of the widespread adoption of telecommuting by Federal employees in the United States.(Sec. 402) Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to eliminate the pension offset requirement regarding an annuitant who was formerly an employee of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and who returns as a consultant to the Commission, if the annuitant has a skill critical to the performance of Commission duties."
