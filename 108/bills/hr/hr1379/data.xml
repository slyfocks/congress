  <summary>3/20/2003--Introduced.
Declares that it shall be unlawful to sell gasoline at wholesale or retail for a price in excess of the price that grade of gasoline sold for in the same market on March 10, 2003. Imposes a civil penalty of $10,000 for each day on which a violation occurs. States that this prohibition shall expire 60 days after the Secretary of Energy reports to Congress an analysis of gasoline price fluctuations, giving particular attention to the occurrence of price gouging as cause of such fluctuations. Requires such report to include the Secretary's recommendations for legislative or administrative actions that could improve gasoline price stability and eliminate price gouging.</summary>
