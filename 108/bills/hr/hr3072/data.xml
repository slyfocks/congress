Steel Financing Fairness Act - Prohibits the Overseas Private Investment Corporation from providing insurance or financing for a project: (1) in any country that grants a subsidy to its steel industry until three months after such subsidy is eliminated; or (2) that produces, outside of the United States, any product subject to antidumping duties. Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to require the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund to oppose any assistance from the Fund to any foreign government that subsidizes its steel industry until three months after such subsidy is eliminated; and (2) reduce the U.S. contribution to the Fund if the Fund provides assistance to any such government during such period. Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank from guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit for exports to any foreign government that subsidizes its steel industry until three months after such subsidy is eliminated.</summary>
