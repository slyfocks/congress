Prohibits, with specified exceptions, the use of Iraq reconstruction funds appropriated by this Act: (1) to enter into any Federal contract through the use of procedures other than competitive procedures; or (2) for a task or delivery order in excess of $1 million unless the underlying task or delivery order contract was awarded to two or more contractors and such contractors have a fair opportunity to be considered for the order. Requires the head of each executive agency entering into a contract relating to activities in Iraq to develop a plan for minimizing costs to the Federal Government through the use of Iraqi firms.
