    "text": "Port Anti-Terrorism and Security Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit damaging or destroying a vessel or maritime facility. Provides enhanced penalties where the vessel carried high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel. Prohibits placing in U.S. waters devices or substances likely to destroy or damage ships. Prohibits piracy, privateering, theft or intentional wrecking of a vessel, or use of a dangerous weapon or explosive on a passenger vessel. Provides sanctions for failure to heave to and for obstructing boarding or providing false information during a boarding. Prohibits the knowing discharge of hazardous substances in U.S. navigable waters or the adjacent shoreline with intent to endanger human life, health, or welfare or the marine environment. Directs the Attorney General to: (1) take specified actions to coordinate port-related crime data collection; and (2) establish an outreach program to work with State and local law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data on cargo theft and with local port security committees to disseminate such information to appropriate law enforcement officials. Sets civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation of Federal prohibitions against theft or embezzlement related to interstate or foreign shipments by carrier. Amends the Tariff Act to increase penalties for falsity or lack of a manifest. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a plan to inspect merchandise and containers at foreign facilities."
