    "text": "Active Duty Naturalization Accommodation Act of 2004 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) to establish procedures under which deadlines, interviews, and similar requirements otherwise applicable to the naturalization process are suspended with regard to an alien who has applied for naturalization and is stationed abroad on active duty status in the U.S. Armed Forces until the alien is provided additional time (at least 30 days) after returning to the United States in which to meet such requirements. Allows aliens to waive application of the suspension provision and to meet naturalization requirements while absent from the United States. Directs the Secretary to establish a form that an alien may (but shall not be required to) use to request such suspension. Requires: (1) the Secretary to provide information about the suspension provisions of this Act to aliens applying for naturalization; and (2) to the extent practicable, the Secretary of Defense to inform aliens on active duty abroad of the procedures applicable to suspension and to make available the form for requesting suspension. Sets forth transition provisions for aliens who had applied for naturalization but missed applicable deadlines, interviews, or similar requirements while on active duty abroad during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on the effective date of this Act."
