Authorizes the NMFS to grant permits for vessels with NMFS-provided observers to fish in closed areas of the Atlantic Ocean in furtherance of the research program.Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to close to pelagic longline fishing the lower mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone between August 15 and October 1 and the upper mid-Atlantic Conservation Zone between July 15 and October 1 of each year.</summary>
