Prohibits funds from being obligated or expended for a project or activity under this Act until 30 days after the Secretary submits to Congress a report on the purpose and amount of such funds, unless the Secretary determines that a critical emerging proliferation threat warrants immediate obligation or expenditure of such funds. Requires the Secretary to submit a justification within 72 hours after any such immediate expenditure. Requires the Secretary to report to Congress on the advisability of establishing new cooperative threat reduction programs to account for projects or activities funded under this Act if the Secretary uses such funds for two consecutive years."
