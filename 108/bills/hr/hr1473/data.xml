  <summary>3/27/2003--Introduced.
Insurance Credit Score Disclosure and Reporting Act - Requires insurers who use consumer reports or insurance credit scores as a factor in underwriting insurance policies or renewals to disclose the effect of such practice upon the scope and cost of the insurance at the time of either insurance application or insurance renewal. Prescribes disclosure requirements, including disclosure of the relationship between the use of insurance credit scores or other risk scores or predictors. Directs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) promulgate requirements for insurers to submit specified insurance credit score information to the Commission; and (2) investigate and report to Congress on the relationship between credit information and insurance credit scores and the race, income, geographic location, and age of insurance applicants and policyholders. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of this Act.</summary>
