    "text": "International Consumer Protection Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to include within unfair or deceptive acts or practices those involving foreign commerce that: (1) cause or are likely to cause reasonably foreseeable injury within the United States; or (2) involve material conduct occurring within the United States. Makes available to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to such acts in foreign commerce all remedies it uses in domestic commerce, including restitution to domestic or foreign victims. Sets forth FTC powers, including authority to provide investigative assistance for foreign law enforcement agencies. Authorizes FTC attorneys to assist the Attorney General in foreign litigation and FTC sharing of information with foreign law enforcement agencies. Applies to the FTC the procedures for delay of notification or prohibition of disclosure under the Right to Financial Privacy Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act where a court or the FTC finds that notification may cause an adverse result. Authorizes the FTC, where neither notification nor delayed notification are required, to apply ex parte for a court order prohibiting the recipient of compulsory process issued by the FTC from disclosing to any other person the existence of such process. Sets forth guidelines for the protection of specified entities who volunteer information to the FTC. Permits the temporary exchange of staff between the FTC and foreign government agencies in order to facilitate implementation of this Act. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act to permit the FTC to exchange information with specified financial regulators."
