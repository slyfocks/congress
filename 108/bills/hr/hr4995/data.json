    "text": "Energy Efficiency Act - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to require that only intermittent escalators be acquired for installation in Federal buildings. Defines an intermittent escalator as an escalator that remains in a stationary position until it automatically operates at the approach of a passenger, and returns to a stationary position after the passenger completes passage. Provides an exception to this requirement for a location outside the United States if the cost to acquire an intermittent escalator would be substantially greater over the life of the escalator. Requires Federal agencies to incorporate other escalator energy conservation measures, as appropriate."
