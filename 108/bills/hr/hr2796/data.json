Mandates that any credit scoring system used to generate any risk or credit score be in compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Requires a consumer reporting agency, upon request, to disclose to the consumer clearly and accurately all information in the consumer's file, including: (1) credit consumer reports and any information concerning reports and credit scores; (2) any other risk scores or predictors, including any credit scores used; and (3) a clear, concise summary of how the scores and predictors are derived. Cites circumstances that require a consumer reporting agency to furnish free disclosures upon request. Requires every consumer reporting agency taking adverse action based upon a consumer report to: (1) provide a copy of such report, including other risk scores or predictors, and credit scores used; and (2) provide a written summary of all consumer rights and how to exercise them."
