  <summary>3/31/2004--Introduced.
Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require a group health plan and an insurer offering group health coverage to provide screening for colorectal cancer to individuals who are age 50 or over or at high risk for colorectal cancer. Specifies the type of screening and the frequency of screening required. Allows State laws providing greater protection than that provided by this Act. Applies the same requirements to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market. Requires the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate their rules, regulations and enforcement policies.</summary>
