  <summary>11/21/2003--Introduced.
Declares that U.S.-produced taconite pellets shall be considered an article like or directly competitive with semi-finished steel slabs for purposes of: (1) any International Trade Commission determination that semi-finished steel slabs are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury (or threat) to the domestic industry producing taconite pellets (thus requiring remedial action); (2) any investigation leading to the imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties; and (3) the Secretary of Labor's determination of the eligibility of a group of adversely-affected workers for trade adjustment assistance.</summary>
