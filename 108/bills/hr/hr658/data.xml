(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on June 17, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Accountant, Compliance, and Enforcement Staffing Act of 2003 - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to permit the Securities and Exchange Commission to appoint any candidates for accountant, economist, and securities compliance examiner positions in the competitive service according to statutes, rules, and regulations for the excepted service, notwithstanding those governing appointments in the competitive service. Declares that such appointments shall not be considered to cause a position to be converted from the competitive service to the excepted service. Instructs the Commission to report to specified congressional committees on the changes in the hiring process authorized by this Act, including: (1) the quality of candidates; (2) the procedures used by the Commission to select candidates through the streamlined hiring process; (3) the numbers, types, and grades of employees hired under the authority; (4) any benefits or shortcomings associated with the use of the authority; (5) the effect of the exercise of the authority on the hiring of veterans and other demographic groups; and (6) the way in which managers were trained in the administration of the streamlined hiring system.</summary>
