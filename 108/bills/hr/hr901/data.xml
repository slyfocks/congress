  <summary>7/14/2003--Reported to House amended.
Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Secretaries of Transportation and Homeland Security, to carry out a project to construct a bridge on Federal land west of and adjacent to Folsom Dam in California. Directs the Secretary to construct the bridge as a two-lane bridge unless the City of Folsom requests that it be constructed as a four-lane bridge. Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement to transfer the bridge to the City of Folsom which shall assume full responsibility for its operation and maintenance. States that the bridge shall be constructed at full Federal expense if it is a two-lane bridge, but that if it is a four-lane bridge the City of Folsom shall be required to contribute 20 percent of the cost of construction. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
