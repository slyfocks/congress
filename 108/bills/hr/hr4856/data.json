    "text": "Child Safety, Adoption, and Family Enhancement (Child SAFE) Act of 2004 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to revise eligibility for adoption assistance and foster care maintenance payments by eliminating certain income requirements, reducing Federal matching rates, allowing separate standards for relative foster family homes, modifying provisions for foster children's Medicaid eligibility, and including Indian tribes as eligible for such payments. Provides for Safe Children, Strong Families Programs, which revise and combine currently separate part B title IV SSA programs for child and family services and for promoting safe and stable families. Provides such part B grant allotment funds for States and Indian tribes to improve protection for children and strengthen families. Continues grants for State court improvement of adoption and foster care proceedings, and for programs mentoring children of prisoners. Establishes challenge grants to reward efforts to move children safely from foster care and prevent the removal of children from their homes. Revises child welfare waiver authority to eliminate various limitations, and to extend such authority to approve demonstration projects. Extends and increases amounts of high performance bonuses, under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to review State agency determinations of blindness and disability, under Supplemental Security Income (SSI)."
