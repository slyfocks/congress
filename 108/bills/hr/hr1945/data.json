    "text": "Pacific Salmon Recovery Act - (Sec. 2) Requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide financial assistance for salmon conservation and habitat restoration activities to qualified States (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho) and tribal governments. (Sec. 3) Requires a recipient State or tribe to have a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary. Sets forth eligible activities, including: (1) watershed evaluation and planning; (2) salmon-related research and habitat restoration; (3) Bull trout and Lahontan cutthroat trout activities in Oregon; and (4) Bull trout activities in Washington and Idaho. States that funds shall be used for local and regional projects, with permitted use outside the recipient's jurisdiction if such activity will provide conservation benefits to naturally produced salmon in streams of concern to the recipient. Establishes a 25 percent State matching requirement. (Sec. 4) Provides for public participation in State and tribal project decisions. (Sec. 5) Sets forth reporting requirements for the States and the Secretary. (Sec. 7) Defines \"salmon\" as any naturally produced salmon or trout of the following species: (1) coho, chinook, chum, pink, or sockeye salmon; and (2) steelhead or sea-run cutthroat trout. (Sec. 8) Directs the President, for U.S. citizens who served as employees of the International Pacific Salmon and North Pacific Fisheries Commissions and who worked in Canada during the course of such employment, to calculate and report to Congress the difference in amount between the valuation of the Commissions' annuity for each employee's payment in U.S. and in Canadian currency for past and future annuity payments. (Sec. 9) Authorizes FY 2004 through 2006 appropriations. (Sec. 10) Expresses the sense of Congress in support of the bipartisan July 2000 goals, objectives, and recommendations of the Governors of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington to protect and restore salmon and other aquatic species while meeting specified environmental, tribal treaty, and Executive order requirements and taking into account economic needs."
