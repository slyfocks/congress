Federal Employee Dental and Vision Benefits Enhancement Act of 2004 - Sets forth provisions for the establishment of programs through which current and retired Federal employees and their family members and dependents may obtain enhanced dental and vision benefits to supplement those available under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB). Urges Congress to evaluate such supplemental plans to determine the options for, and feasibility of, providing an employer contribution. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to submit a report to Congress describing and evaluating options whereby health insurance coverage under FEHB could be made available to unmarried dependent children under twenty five years of age who are enrolled as full-time students at institutions of higher education.</summary>
