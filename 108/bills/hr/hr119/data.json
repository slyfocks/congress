Reserves five percent of such funds for allocation to Indian tribes.Prohibits such assistance from being used to carry out projects to control or eradicate animal pests.Allows an Indian tribe, if the funds allocated to tribes are not sufficient to provide such assistance to each weed management entity of a tribe, to seek additional funding by participating as a local stakeholder in the establishment of such an entity.Permits any activity involving real property to be carried out only with the consent of the landowner."
