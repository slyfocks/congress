Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) prepare and distribute to health professionals (and others upon request) a consumer's mercury advisory notice regarding the health risks of fish consumption; and (2) establish a toll-free number for individuals who desire additional information. Requires the Administrator to prepare and distribute to specified State entities and applicants for fishing licenses (and others upon request) a consumer's guide to mercury, including a health advisory for the consumption of recreationally-caught fish. Requires the Secretary to work with States and other entities to: (1) develop and distribute standardized advisories, including consumption advisories and health warnings, regarding the presence of methyl-mercury in seafood; and (2) design and implement a related national public education program. Directs the Commissioner to resume the Food and Drug Administration's seafood methyl-mercury monitoring sampling program. Requires the Secretary, within one year of enactment of this Act, to finalize the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point assessment to determine whether methyl-mercury exposure through fish consumption is a public health hazard."
