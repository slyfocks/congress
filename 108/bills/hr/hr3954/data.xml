Rancho El Cajon Boundary Reconciliation Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to provide compensation to a landowner whose title to specified land in San Diego County, California, is based on an erroneous survey conducted by a Government contractor in 1881 and is rendered void because that title is inferior to the title to the same land established by a survey of the Rancho El Cajon conducted in 1872 and approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office in 1876. Sets forth provisions regarding the forms and amount of compensation, and the source of funds for payments, under this Act.</summary>
