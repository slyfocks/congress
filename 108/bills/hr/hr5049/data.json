Declares such revocation of market rate authority effective retroactive to the date on which FERC determines that Enron initially engaged in price manipulation of electric energy sales or in any fraudulent activity regarding such sales. Requires FERC to issue an order prohibiting Enron (and any Enron affiliate, bankruptcy trustee for the company, or any successor in interest to Enron or its affiliates) from enforcing claims for monetary damages or otherwise enforcing contract provisions against the purchaser in the case of certain electric energy or natural gas sales contracts."
