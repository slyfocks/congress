  <summary>1/8/2003--Introduced.
Equitable Care for All Veterans Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to modify the funding allocation formula for the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system known as the Veterans Resource Allocation (VERA) system to provide for the incorporation of regional differences in the cost of providing health care to veterans as part of the criteria used to determine the national means differential used. Directs the Secretary to evaluate the effects of such modifications on the regional allocation of funds available to the Department of Veterans Affairs for health care and, if the modifications do not result in a substantive shift in such allocations, to terminate VERA.Directs the Secretary, if required to terminate VERA, to develop a new formula for the allocation of funds to the Department's national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), that takes into account specified requirements, including additional costs incurred by a VISN because the age of veterans, or the number of veterans requiring complex care, in that VISN exceeds the median for all VISNs.Authorizes additional appropriations to be allocated to VISNs that have experienced funding reductions.</summary>
