  <summary>12/8/2003--Introduced.
Fairness to Local Contractors Act - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and defense contract law to require a bidder or offeror, to be considered a responsible bidder or offeror for the construction of a public building, facility, or work, to submit a tax clearance (a document stating that such entity is in compliance with all State tax laws) from the State in which the contract is to be performed. Requires the head of a Federal or defense agency to withhold the final payment under such a contract until the contractor submits both a tax clearance and a certification of compliance with all State laws concerning payments to employees under a contract, including unemployment insurance, workers compensation, health insurance, and disability insurance. Authorizes the head of a Federal or defense agency to: (1) withhold from any contractor payments amounts necessary to pay any State tax liability attributable to the contract; and (2) pay such amount directly to such State. Directs the Secretary of Defense or agency head to require a contractor to be licensed if the State in which a construction contract is to be performed requires a license. Requires revision of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to explain the general excise tax law of Hawaii.</summary>
