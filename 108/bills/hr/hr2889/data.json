Requires the Secretary, based on study findings, to promulgate regulations under the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act that establish conservation and management measures to minimize the bycatch and mortality of bycatch of Atlantic Striped Bass caught in non-directed commercial fishing in the Mid-Atlantic exclusive economic zone. Requires such regulations to include temporary closure of any identified location in which there is a particularly high level of Atlantic Striped Bass in non-directed commercial fishing, under which the deployment of net, finfish trap, or longline gear by any vessel fishing under a Federal fishing permit shall be prohibited."
