Directs the Secretary of the Interior to include additional land in the Wilderness yet to be acquired and certain other land when all prohibited uses of such land have ceased, and to adjust the boundary of the Wilderness to include such land. Requires that the map of the Wilderness be on file and available for public inspection in offices of the National Park System. Directs that the Wilderness be administered by the Secretary under applicable provisions of the Wilderness Act. Allows persons with an existing right to utility service on Cumberland Island to retain such right in the Wilderness after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary to prepare a management plan to ensure access to certain roads in the Wilderness for the purpose of transporting visitors to and from historic sites adjacent to the Wilderness. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into not more than three concession contracts for the provision of tours for visitors to the Seashore."
