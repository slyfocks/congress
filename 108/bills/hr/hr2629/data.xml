  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
New Aid for Trustworthy, Affordable Drugs Act (NAFTA Drugs Act) - Directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to enter into agreements with other North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) countries (Canada and Mexico) to harmonize regulatory requirements such that drugs approved for commercial distribution in any NAFTA country may be imported or exported between NAFTA countries. Permits the USTR to enter into such an agreement only if the agreement provides for: (1) regulatory standards for drugs that are consistent with the requirements of this Act; (2) a seal, to be placed only by a registered pharmacy, certifying that a given drug meets the standards of the harmonization agreement and may be imported; (3) a unique system of tracking numbers identifying certain entities, including the drug manufacturer and the NAFTA county of origin; (4) the reimbursement by drug manufacturers of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for benefits derived from National Institutes of Health research. Sets a sunset of one year after the passage of this Act for the authority of the USTR to enter into harmonization agreements under this Act.</summary>
