Provides for a three-year statute of limitation (from the end of the compliance period) for assessing a recapture deficiency. Requires owners of buildings eligible for the low income housing tax credit to file informational returns with the Secretary of the Treasury upon the occurrence of a recapture event and to provide persons who are named in such returns with specified information. Imposes penalties for failure to file required returns."
