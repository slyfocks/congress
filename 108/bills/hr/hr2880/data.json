Authorizes a grant award directly to a political subdivision if the subdivision serves a substantial number of foster care youth. Prescribes program implementation guidelines, including: (1) application requirements; (2) training; (3) screening; (4) educational requirements; (5) Federal and non-Federal share of funds for the Program; (6) considerations in awarding grants; and (7) use of funds. Sets forth a maximum grant amount to be awarded to a State or political subdivision. Authorizes the Secretary to award a competitive grant to an eligible entity to establish a National Hotline Service or Website to provide information to individuals interested in becoming mentors to youth in foster care. Instructs the Secretary of Education to implement a program to provide for the discharge or cancellation of the Federal student loan indebtedness of an eligible mentor."
