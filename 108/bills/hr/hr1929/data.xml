Healthy Early Education Workforce Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make an annual allotment to each State that submits an application for formula grants to provide access to affordable health benefits coverage for: (1) eligible child care providers and the staff of center-based child care providers; and (2) certain relatives of such providers and staff, at the discretion of the State involved.Sets forth the following permissible activities for such grants: (1) to reimburse an employer or other individual specified under this Act for premiums or other costs for coverage under group or individual plans; (2) to offset the cost of enrolling individuals in public health benefits plans; and (3) to otherwise subsidize the cost of health benefits coverage to individuals specified under this Act.Requires a State to match at least 50 percent of the costs of the activities for which it receives a grant.Specifies portions of the funds appropriated under this Act to go to U.S. territories and possessions and Indian tribes. Sets forth a formula for calculating the amount to be received by each State (including the District of Columbia).Directs the Secretary to conduct an evaluation of several State programs representing various approaches to raising the rate of child workers with health benefits coverage.</summary>
