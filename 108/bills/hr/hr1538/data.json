    "text": "True American Heroes Act of 2003 - Title I: Medals for Responders and Resisters - Directs the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate to make arrangements for the posthumous award of congressional gold medals to: (1) the emergency workers, government employees, and others who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and perished in the tragic events of September 11, 2001; (2) each passenger and crew member on board United Airlines Flight 93 who is identified by the Attorney General as having helped resist the hijackers before the crash; and (3) officers, emergency workers, and other Federal employees who responded to the attacks on the Pentagon and perished that day. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to strike such medals and to strike gold duplicates of the first medal for presentation to the Governor of New York, the Mayor of New York City, and other specified police, fire, medical, and Port Authority officials and stations in New York and New Jersey. Authorizes the Secretary to strike and sell duplicate bronze medals. Title II: Spirit of America Commemorative Coins - Directs the Secretary to mint and issue $50-dollar gold coins, one-dollar silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins emblematic of the tragic events that occurred at the Pentagon, in New York City, and in Pennsylvania, on September 11, 2001. Sets forth surcharges for the coins minted under this title (not less than $100 per $50 coin, ten dollars per dollar coin, and five dollars per half-dollar coin), with the proceeds in excess of the cost of producing the gold coins to be used to cover the costs of producing the gold medals under title I not recovered from the sale of duplicate bronze medals, with any amount remaining to be transferred to a victims fund determined to be appropriate."
