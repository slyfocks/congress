    "text": "Consumer Credit and Identity Protection Act of 2001 [sic] - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to declare that only the last four digits of a consumer's account number may be printed (truncated) on transaction receipts when identifying an account with respect to an electronic fund transfer initiated by the consumer at an electronic terminal. Authorizes temporary waivers of this requirement if the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System determines that retrofitting an existing electronic terminal to comply by the effective date of this Act is unduly burdensome. Directs the Board to study and report to Congress on truncation of credit and debit card account numbers in all consumer transactions."
