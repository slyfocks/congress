  <summary>5/21/2003--Introduced.
United States Maritime Industry Promotion Act of 2003 - Amends the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to make a U.S. citizen owning or leasing any vessel in the domestic commerce of the United States eligible to establish a capital construction fund. (Currently only U.S. citizens owning or leasing Great Lakes or noncontiguous domestic trade vessels are eligible). Redefines the term "vessels" to include dry dock or mobile offshore drilling units or production units, but excludes towing vessels or barges operated on the inland waterways of the United States.</summary>
