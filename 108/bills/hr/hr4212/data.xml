  <summary>4/22/2004--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) removing potential nuclear weapons materials from vulnerable sites around the world would reduce the threat that such materials would fall into the hands of al Qaeda and other groups and states hostile to the United States; and (2) such removal should be a top priority. Directs the President to establish the Task Force on Nuclear Material Removal to ensure that such materials are entirely removed from the most vulnerable sites around the world as soon as practicable. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to provide specified assistance to the Task Force, including funding for the cost of: (1) removing such materials, as well as arranging for their shipment to the United States or other countries willing to accept and secure them; and (2) upgrading security and accounting at sites where such materials will remain for an extended period.</summary>
