Denies the provision of funds made available for certain Federal departments and agencies to institutions of higher education unless military recruiters are provided access to campuses at such institutions that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and students that is provided to any other employer. Adds the Department of Homeland Security, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Central Intelligence Agency to the list of Federal departments and agencies whose funds will be denied to postsecondary schools that prevent ROTC access or military recruiting. Codifies under Federal armed forces law a provision of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 which excludes from such funding prohibition any amounts provided solely for student financial assistance, related administrative costs, or costs associated with attendance.</summary>
