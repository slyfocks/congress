Directs that mapping priorities be based in part on the needs of the Department of the Interior land management agencies. Modifies the composition of the advisory committee. Directs that the national geologic database include information on how to obtain specified maps, databases, and data, including all maps developed with funding provided under the national cooperative geologic mapping program.
