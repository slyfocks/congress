States that such amendments shall be subject to certain sunset provisions under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. Amends the Code to provide a uniform definition of \"child.\" Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to extend customs user fees."
