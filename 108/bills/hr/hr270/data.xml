Veterans Equal Treatment Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to: (1) discontinue the funding allocation formula for the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system known as the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system at the end of the fiscal year in which this Act is enacted; and (2) develop a new formula for the allocation of funds to the national service regions, known as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), that takes into account specified requirements, including additional costs incurred by a VISN because the age of veterans, or the number of veterans requiring complex care, in that VISN exceeds the median for all VISNs.Authorizes additional appropriations to be allocated to VISNs that have experienced funding reductions.</summary>
