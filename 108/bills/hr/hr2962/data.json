Sets penalties for violations by persons (up to a $500,000 fine and 20 years' imprisonment) and organizations (up to a $2 million fine). Authorizes appropriations to the Attorney General to make grants to provide training to State and local prosecutors and law enforcement agents for prosecution of ecstasy offenses. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide for the use by local educational agencies of grant funds for activities to prevent or reduce the use of the illegal drug commonly called ecstasy."
