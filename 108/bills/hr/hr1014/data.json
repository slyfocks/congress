Authorizes the relevant Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with gateway communities to coordinate the management of: (1) the land use inventory, planning, and management activities administered by such Secretary; and (2) the land use planning and management activities of other Federal agencies, agencies of the State in which the public lands are located, and local and tribal governments in the vicinity of such lands. Requires, when the plans of two or more Federal agencies are anticipated to have an impact on a gateway community, the consolidation and coordination of the agencies' plans and planning processes in order to facilitate the participation of affected gateway communities. Directs the relevant Secretary to allow any affected gateway communities the opportunity to be recognized as cooperating agencies under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 when a proposed action is determined to require an environmental impact statement. Allows the relevant Secretary to make grants to any gateway community with a population of 10,000 or less to carry out the purposes of this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
