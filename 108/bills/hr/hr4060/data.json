States that the Ombudsman shall: (1) administer current and former employee complaints; (2) be prohibited from involvement in matters subject to ongoing adjudication, litigation, or investigation; and (3) report semiannually to the Director of the Peace Corps, the Chair of the Peace Corps National Advisory Council, and Congress regarding such duties. (Sec. 3) Establishes the Office of Safety and Security of the Peace Corps, which shall headed by the Associate Director of Safety and Security of the Peace Corps. States that the Office shall be responsible for safety and security activities of the Peace Corps, including background checks, volunteer, staff, and facilities safety, and information technology security. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Associate Director of Safety and Security of the Peace Corps should assign a Peace Corps country security coordinator for each country where the Peace Corps has a volunteer program; and (2) each country security coordinator should be under the supervision of the appropriate Peace Corps country director, should report directly to the Associate Director of Safety and Security of the Peace Corps, and should be a United States citizen who has access to information, including classified information, relating to possible threats against Peace Corps volunteers. (Sec. 4) Requires specified reports respecting Peace Corps: (1) medical services; (2) volunteer assignment; and (2) employment duration. (Sec. 6) Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to provide for the appointment of an Office of Inspector General for the Peace Corps."
