Prohibits such reclassification from taking effect unless: (1) the Secretary of State has entered into negotiations with the foreign country involved to develop an air quality improvement plan for the international area encompassing the nonattainment area and submitted that plan to Congress; and (2) taking into consideration such plan, the Administrator has taken appropriate action to improve air quality in the nonattainment area."
