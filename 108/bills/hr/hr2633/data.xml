  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
Identity Theft Protection and Information Blackout Act of 2003 - Amends the Social Security Act to: (1) restrict the sale of social security account numbers by governmental agencies; (2) prohibit the display to the general public of social security account numbers possessed by such agencies; (3) prohibit display of social security account numbers on checks issued for payment by such agencies; (4) prohibit the appearance of social security account numbers on driver's licenses or motor vehicle registrations; and (5) extend civil monetary penalty authority. Amends Federal criminal law to: (1) restrict the display, sale, or purchase of social security numbers without the individual's affirmative, express consent; and (2) authorize the Federal court to order the violator of such restrictions to pay restitution to the Social Security Administration, which shall be considered the victim. Deems refusal to do business without receipt of social security account number to be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to: (1) mandate confidential treatment by a consumer reporting agency with respect to the social security account number of a consumer; (2) prohibit such agency from furnishing reports containing medical information for employment purposes, or in connection with a credit or insurance transaction unless the consumer specifically grants written consent on a separate document that describes in clear and concise language the use for which the information will be furnished; and (3) proscribe the procurement or use of medical information in connection with any offer to provide any financial product or service, other than insurance.</summary>
