Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a procedure for reimbursement of enrollees under the Medicare PPO Demonstration Project for claims for services furnished before January 1, 2005, that should be (or have been) covered but were not covered because of their provision by an out-of-network provider; and (2) provide for an adjustment in the capitation rates for plans under the project for months in 2005 so as to reduce payment under such rates, in the aggregate, by the aggregate amount of payments the Secretary estimates will be paid under such procedure."
