Water Conservation Incentive Act of 2004 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for the cost of qualified water conservation property installed in a principal residence and which has a useful life of at least five years. Defines "qualified water conservation property" to include smart dual or multi program irrigation clocks, low-flow shower heads, ultra low-flush toilets, and high-efficiency clothes washing machines. Limits the amount of such credit to $1,000 for a taxable year.
