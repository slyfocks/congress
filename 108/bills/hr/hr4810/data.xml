Direct Funding for First Responders Act of 2004 - Requires 50 percent of the amounts provided under certain Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants for first responders to be distributed directly to local entities (including local governments and first responders) and allocated among and by such entities in the manner proposed in the approved grant application. Makes this Act applicable to DHS grants to States or regions to improve the ability of first responders to prevent, prepare for, respond to, or mitigate threatened or actual terrorist attacks, especially those involving weapons of mass destruction, including any grant under DHS's State Homeland Security Grant Program or Urban Area Security Initiative. Excludes grants not administered by DHS, fire grant programs authorized under the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, and grants under the Emergency Management Performance Grant and the Urban Search and Rescue Grants Programs.</summary>
