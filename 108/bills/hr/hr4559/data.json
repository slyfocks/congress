    "text": "Post-Conflict Trade Recovery Act - Authorizes the President to designate any country emerging from political instability, civil strife, or armed conflict as a beneficiary country if the country: (1) has established, or is making continual progress toward establishing, a market-based economy, the rule of law and the right to due process, political pluralism, and other specified economic and political goals; (2) does not engage in activities that undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests; (3) is a signatory of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, does not engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, and is making continuing and verifiable progress on the protection of internationally recognized human rights; (4) is not listed by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, and cooperates fully in international efforts to combat terrorism; and (5) otherwise meets specified eligibility criteria of the Trade Act of 1974. Provides that if a country fails to meet the requirements of clause (1), but otherwise meets the rest of the requirements, the President may designate the country as a beneficiary country if determined that such designation will be in the national economic or security interest of the United States and reports the determination to Congress and the reason therefor. Authorizes the President to designate articles as eligible for duty-free treatment from all beneficiary countries for purposes of this Act by Executive order or presidential proclamation after receiving the advice of the International Trade Commission. Prescribes the rule of origin for eligible articles imported directly from beneficiary countries. Terminates on December 31, 2011, the duty-free treatment or other preferential treatment extended to beneficiary countries under this Act."
