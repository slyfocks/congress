Amends the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Community Partnership Enhancement Act of 1998 to replace \"pilot project\" with \"project\" (thus ending the temporary nature of the projects) regarding the Secretary of the Interior's requirement to carry out a project at two or more national wildlife refuges or complexes of geographically related refuges in each U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service region. Removes the cap on such projects (currently, limited to 20 pilot projects nationwide). Requires the Secretary, after the enactment of this Act and every three years thereafter, to evaluate and make recommendations regarding the projects. Authorizes appropriations for each fiscal year through FY 2009. Amends the Act to authorize the Secretary to negotiate and enter into a cooperative agreement with a partner organization, academic institution, State or local government agency, or other person to implement one or more projects or programs for a refuge or complex of geographically related refuges in accordance with the purposes of the Act and in compliance with the policies of other relevant authorities, regulations, and policy guidance."
