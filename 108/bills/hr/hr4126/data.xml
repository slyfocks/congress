  <summary>4/1/2004--Introduced.
Cockpit Security Technical Corrections and Improvements Act of 2004 - Amends Federal aviation law to revise requirements for the program for deputizing eligible pilots as Federal law enforcement officers (Federal flight deck officers) to defend against acts of criminal violence or air piracy. Shifts responsibility for the program from the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Revises eligibility requirements for pilots to be a Federal flight deck officer, adding mental standards and firearms training. Makes a special exception from ordinary requirements for certain active or reserve members of the armed forces or a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. Revises certain Federal flight deck officer training requirements and adds requalification training requirements. Revises requirements for the carrying of firearms by Federal flight deck officers outside of the United States, including designation as Federal air marshals, and the authority to use force to defend an aircraft against terrorism by a Federal flight deck officer. Extends to entities and individuals the prohibition (currently limited to air carriers) against prohibiting a pilot employed by an air carrier from becoming or threatening retaliatory action against such a pilot for becoming a Federal flight deck officer. Specifies further prohibited disciplinary actions. Authorizes a Federal flight deck officer or pilot who is adversely affected by a failure by the Secretary to comply with any requirements under this Act to file a petition for judicial review with the appropriate U.S. district court. Sets forth requirements to: (1) prohibit the disclosure of information related to a pilot's participation in the Federal flight deck officer program; (2) provide certain adjudication procedures for pilots who have been determined ineligible to be a Federal flight deck officer or has had other adverse action taken against them; (3) provide certain authorities with respect to Federal flight deck officers, including issuance of credentials, use of force to prevent terrorism or defend life, exposure to security inspections, and access to sensitive security information; (4) require certain reports to Congress on the Federal flight deck officer program; and (5) require the Secretary to promote and publicize the Federal flight deck officer program.</summary>
