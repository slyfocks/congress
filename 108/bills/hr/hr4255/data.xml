Computer Software Privacy and Control Act of 2004 - Makes it unlawful for any person to transmit to a protected computer owned and operated by another person, or to transmit to such computer prior to its first retail sale, any computer software, or component thereof, that: (1) collects personal information about an owner or operator and transfers the information to any person other than such owner or operator; (2) monitors or analyzes the content of the Internet web pages accessed by a computer owner or operator and transfers that information to any person other than the owner or operator; or (3) modifies default computer settings selected by the owner or operator that affect the Web page first displayed, the Internet connection settings, or the actions or operations of any Internet search service offered by a provider of such services, unless, before any of actions above, notice is provided to, and consent is received from, such owner or operator, and such software or component includes a removal utility. Makes it unlawful for a person to transmit to a protected computer any software that includes a function to deliver or display advertisements, unless notice is provided to, and consent is received from, the owner or operator. Provides for enforcement of such prohibitions through: (1) the Federal Trade Commission; (2) criminal proceedings; or (3) State actions on behalf of its residents. Requires semiannual reports from the Attorney General to the congressional judiciary committees concerning actions on warrants or other orders applied for by law enforcement agencies whose implementation involved the transmission or execution of computer software on a protected computer to record computer activity or to intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communications.</summary>
