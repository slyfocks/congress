    "date": "2003-10-21", 
    "text": "Small Business Reauthorization and Manufacturing Revitalization Act of 2003 - Title I: Small Business Investment Act of 1958 Amendments and Related Provisions - (Sec. 103) Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to: (1) increase the percentage interest authorized to be charged by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to small business investment companies (SBICs) in order for the SBA to guarantee the payment of principal and interest on participating securities issued by such companies for the purpose of providing equity capital to small businesses; (2) increase the maximum amount of outstanding loan leverage for SBA-authorized SBICs; (3) direct the SBA Administrator, as a condition of approval for loan leverage, to require a licensee to certify in writing that not less than 25 percent of the licensee's aggregate amount of financings will be provided to smaller enterprises; (4) provide authorized and unauthorized actions of the Administrator with respect to a licensee's capital impairment; (5) provide conditions for the distribution of income balances of participating SBICs after making authorized annual payments to partners, shareholders, etc.; (6) redefine \"low-income geographic area\" for purposes of the new markets venture capital program (program); (7) include as a purpose of such program meeting unmet equity capital needs of small manufacturers in low-income geographic areas; (8) require participation agreements under such program to include at least one agreement with a company engaged primarily in development of and investment in small manufacturers; (9) direct the Administrator to provide grant assistance for the establishment of an operational assistance program for small businesses or manufacturers conditionally approved to participate in the program; (10) require the Administrator to prescribe standard documents for final program approval application which will substantially reduce the cost burden of the application process on the companies involved; (11) reduce the authorization of appropriations for the program; (12) repeal lease guarantee authority under the small business investment program; (13) include the provision of assistance to small manufacturers and to areas having a population of less than 50,000 among the activities which will qualify a State development company for participation in the small business investment program; (14) include as authorized projects under the small business investment company program projects which will create or retain one job for every $50,000 guaranteed by the SBA in the case of a small business, and one job for every $100,000 guaranteed by the SBA in the case of a small manufacturer; (15) increase loan limits for small businesses participating in the small business investment program, and create loan limits for small manufacturers so participating; (16) revise loan approval requirements; (17) extend through FY 2005 SBA authority to charge certain loan guarantee fees to State and local development companies participating in the small business investment program; and (18) provide additional qualifications for SBA accredited lenders. (Sec. 126) Revises provisions concerning the establishment of, and requirements under, the Premier Certified Lenders Program (a program of SBA-guaranteed loans for qualifying certified development companies (CDCs) providing financial assistance to small businesses) to authorize the Administrator to designate certain qualified State and local development companies (SLDCs) as premier certified lenders (in lieu of CDCs). Provides similar premier certified lender requirements for SLDCs, including establishment of a loss reserve. Allows a qualified high loss reserve premier certified lender to make an election to establish an alternative loss reserve in lieu of the SBA-required loss reserve, but requires a lender making such election to make contributions to its loss reserve to ensure that it is: (1) not less than $100,000; and (2) sufficient for the lender to meet its obligations to protect the Government from risk of loss. Requires certification of such reserve, and recontribution if insufficient. Establishes, in the SBA, the Bureau of Premier Certified Lenders Program Oversight to carry out specified Program oversight functions. (Sec. 127) Revises provisions allowing the Administrator to delegate to qualified SLDCs the authority to foreclose and liquidate SBA-guaranteed loans to require a qualified SLDC to elect to accept such delegation within 90 days after enactment of this Act. Allows a qualified SLDC to annually elect to continue to accept such delegation of authority. Requires a qualified SLDC, within five days after exercising such authority, to report to the Administrator on actions proposed with respect to a loan (allowing the Administrator to prohibit any such action by written notification). Prohibits a SLDC, without written SBA approval, from committing the SBA to the purchase of additional indebtedness secured by property subject to a defaulted loan. Directs the Administrator to contract out for the foreclosure or liquidation of defaulted loans during any year for which a SLDC does not make an election to exercise such authority. (Sec. 128) Directs the Administrator to prescribe: (1) a low documentation loan application form for use in making SBA-guaranteed loans to qualified SLDCs for loan guarantees of not more than $500,000; and (2) for all other SBA loan guarantees to qualified SLDCs, a short form application that reduces by 30 percent the amount of information required. Requires the Administrator to establish two regional centers for approving such loans. Requires SBA personnel to approve or deny such applications within five business days, unless the application is incomplete. Allows the Administrator to make a decision on such loan within the five-day period. Allows accredited lenders to approve or deny a loan application if the SBA does not act within the five days, and allows a qualified SLDC to make an SBA-guaranteed loan if the SBA does not make a decision within 20 days. Requires the Administrator to report semiannually to the small business committees on the performance of loans made. (Sec. 129) Requires the Administrator to prescribe necessary regulations to carry out amendments made to the above loan program. Prohibits the Administrator from undertaking any other regulatory changes with respect to such loan program until the centralized loan processing has been in operation for one year. (Sec. 131) Directs the Administrator to permit a qualified SLDC to affiliate with a lender authorized to make SBA small business loans if the affiliate is: (1) a qualified SLDC; (2) chartered for purposes of economic development and job creation, without regard to any return on the expected capital; or (3) a business development company chartered by the State with the primary purpose of economic development through small business financing programs. States that any such affiliate shall not be required to have a full-time manager if the qualified SLDC has management in common with the affiliate. Title II: Small Business Act Amendments and Related Provisions - Small Business Amendments Act of 2003 - (Sec. 202) Amends the Small Business Act (the Act) to revise and reorganize the Act. Includes within the Act's findings and statements of policy the inclusion of small manufacturers within those small businesses that the Administrator must assist in competing in international markets. Requires the Administrator, in operating SBA-authorized loan programs, to provide maximum assistance to small manufacturers. (Sec. 203) Revises current definitions and adds new definitions under the Act. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring a small business to recertify its stature as a small business, for Federal contract qualifying purposes, more than once every five years unless there has been a change in business ownership, control, or affiliation. Provides a business growth threshold with respect to such requalification. Includes \"acts of terrorism\" within those events that can be classified as a disaster for SBA disaster loan purposes. Requires a business site visit to a HUBZone (a historically underutilized business area) small business to verify that the business is in a historically underutilized business area and is economically disadvantaged, and therefore eligible for certain SBA contracting solicitation assistance. (Sec. 204) Revises provisions creating the SBA to: (1) require (current law authorizes) the President to appoint a Deputy Administrator of the SBA; (2) allow for injunctive relief against the Administrator in limited circumstances; (3) codify in the Act a current regulation that the Administrator comply with notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act; (4) give the Administrator full (currently limited to co-sponsorship and disaster) authority to receive and solicit gifts of real and personal property and personal services, as long as the gift aids or facilitates the provision of training or technical assistance to small businesses or small manufacturers; (5) require such gifts to be held in a separate account and be subject to audit; (6) prohibit any SBA employee from accepting a gift if the SBA General Counsel concludes that acceptance would constitute a conflict of interest; (7) allow for the separate acceptance of gifts for use in the operation of the disaster loan program (without separate account, auditing, and other requirements of other gifts); (8) authorize any SBA Associate Administrator (currently only the Administrator), after consultation with the General Counsel, to approve SBA co-sponsorship with other entities in programs and activities promoting small business; (9) require the Inspector General to report to Congress on whether the co-sponsorships have furthered SBA purposes; and (10) require the Administrator, in providing assistance under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, to give special consideration to veterans and their survivors and dependents and small manufacturers (as is currently done only under the Act). (Sec. 205) Requires all payments made to the SBA arising out of transactions related to SBA loan and investment programs to be deposited into appropriate accounts and funds as determined by the Administrator (replacing a revolving fund program terminated in 1992). Prohibits the Administrator, for a three-year period, from selling to third parties small business disaster loans made by the SBA. Authorizes the Administrator to compensate an SBA loan pool program fiscal agent through transaction and servicing fees charged to program users and through interest earnings on payments under the agent's control. (Sec. 206) Revises SBA organization and staff-related provisions to provide specific experiential requirements for Associate Administrator and Assistant Administrator positions (with Assistants reporting to Associates). Establishes Associate Administrators for: (1) Capital Access; (2) Government Contracting and Minority Small Business Opportunities; (3) Enterprise Outreach and Training; and (4) Administration and Management (to act also as the SBA Chief Operating Officer). Directs the Assistant Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development to run those SBA loan programs. Makes most Assistant Administrators career (in lieu of political) appointees. Authorizes the Administrator to appoint a General Counsel. Authorizes the Administrator to establish SBA district offices, and to close or combine district offices, as appropriate. Requires each State to have at least one district office, but allows one district office to serve Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Authorizes the appointment of district directors to head the district offices. Requires the Administrator to remove and transfer district directors failing to meet specified goals for small business loans, contract procurements, and financings. Requires each district office to have a district counsel. Authorizes the Administrator to hire sufficient business opportunity specialists to ensure effective guidance and oversight to small businesses participating in loan programs under section 8(a) of the Act. Directs the Associate Administrator for Government Contracting and Minority Small Business to assign SBA procurement center representatives to district offices, as appropriate (requiring at least one representative to serve in each State). Authorizes the Administrator to delegate any function or responsibility to any SBA employee, and to provide regulations to determine which delegations are to be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Requires all other delegations to be placed in a prominent location on the SBA website. Requires the Administrator to redesign the website so that delegations of authority, the SBA organizational chart, links to home pages of each office, and SBA standard operating procedures can be accessed through prominent links. Provides certain transition rules for SBA employees in district offices, including reassigning all deputy directors as either a procurement center or commercial marketing representative at the same salary and grade. (Sec. 207) Codifies in section 7 of the Act all SBA small business loan programs. Repeals provisions: (1) providing special authority to make loans for energy-saving equipment and for veterans (already so empowered in other sections); (2) authorizing loans to organizations representing the disabled; and (3) related to loans for solving Y2K computer problems. Requires the Administrator to resolve any reasonable doubt on loan repayment in favor of small manufacturers (currently, only in favor of disabled persons). Prohibits the Administrator from rejecting a loan applicant solely on the basis of inadequate collateral if there is a fair chance that the loan will be repaid. Allows other owner assets to be used to fulfill the requirement of adequate collateral. Increases SBA loan participation levels for loans made in certain rural areas. Increases to: (1) $2 million the total amounts for international trade (export financing) loans; and (2) $1.2 million the amount of such loan that can be used for working capital. Redefines \"handicapped person\" as \"disabled person\" for purposes of SBA qualification for low (three percent) loan interest rates. Adds service-disabled veterans to those who may receive such rates. Authorizes businesses otherwise eligible for international trade loans to use such loan for debt refinancing, but only to the extent that the existing debt is not structured under reasonable terms and conditions. Requires the Administrator to accept a finding by the International Trade Commission that a business has been adversely affected by international trade for purposes of qualification for an international trade loan. Requires the Administrator to set forth in the CFR the criteria for designation as a certified lender for purposes of the SBA certified lenders program. Extends through FY 2005 (currently FY 2003) the current loan fee charged by the SBA for its guaranteed loans (0.25 percent of the outstanding loan balance). Authorizes the Administrator to contract out for the assessment and collection of such fees. Directs the Administrator to notify the congressional small business committees at least 15 days prior to making any significant policy or administrative change affecting the operation of the small business loan program, including the establishment of any pilot programs. Prohibits more than five percent of the total number of loans guaranteed in a fiscal year from being awarded as part of a pilot program established on or after the enactment of this Act (15 percent for current pilot programs). Limits to three years the duration of a new pilot program (three additional years for current programs). Prohibits any new pilot program from commencing without rulemaking procedures which require notice thereof and opportunity to comment, and CFR codification of such rules. Permanently authorizes (currently a pilot program) the SBA low documentation loan program (a program which requires less loan application information than normal for an SBA-guaranteed loan). Increases from $100,000 to $150,000 the authorized limit for such loans. Requires promulgating rules for such program. Revises provisions concerning the preferred lenders program to require a lender, in order to be designated as preferred, to: (1) demonstrate knowledge of SBA rules and programs; (2) have the ability to process, service, and close loans; and (3) have satisfactory loan performance demonstrated by a default rate which does not exceed (with an exception) the national loan default rate. Authorizes the Administrator to designate a preferred lender as a national preferred lender (and therefore able to make loans throughout the United States without individual application through each local SBA district), but requires national preferred lenders to have additional experience, including prior experience as a preferred lender. Prohibits the Administrator from making such a designation if the lender has failed to receive a substantially satisfactory compliance rating in its most recent audit and examination or a substantially satisfactory rating in a follow-up review. Requires the Administrator to give a national preferred lender the opportunity to cure any performance defect before suspending its national preferred lender status. Directs the Administrator to develop a uniform and simplified loan form for SBA loans of $50,000 or less. Considers a business \"small\" for purposes of SBA loans without regard to affiliation with another business if the applicant has no legal recourse to have such affiliate repay any of its debt obligations. Amends the SBA disaster loan program to remove all provisions related to disaster loans made for disasters prior to October 1, 1982. Limits current disaster loans to 100 percent of the loss less any amount covered by insurance or other financial arrangement. Provides certain minimum disaster loan amounts with respect to loans on real estate ($100,000) and personal property ($20,000). Authorizes the Administrator to make such loans not only in counties where a disaster has been declared, but in contiguous affected counties. Makes 500 employees the applicable size standard for purposes of qualification for the disaster loan. Requires regulations specifying the circumstances under which the Administrator will expand the economic injury disaster loan program beyond the counties that are within, or contiguous to, the declared disaster area. Directs the Administrator to establish by regulation the maximum disaster loan, including conditions under which the maximum is waived to speed economic recovery. Directs the Administrator to ensure that each disaster loan borrower receives a notification containing a description of loan collection practices, practices with respect to the sale of such loans, and the rights of the borrower. Amends the SBA Microloan program (SBA loans to small businesses and small manufacturers for working capital or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment) to authorize the Administrator to select loan intermediaries that have the equivalent of one year experience in making such loans to small businesses and manufacturers. Requires the Administrator to give preferences to intermediaries that make loans of less than $10,000 (with a higher limit with respect to small manufacturer loans). Authorizes intermediaries to provide technical advice and assistance prior to the issuance of a microloan (allowing such intermediaries to contract out for the provision of such advice and assistance). Raises from: (1) $35,000 to $50,000 the loan limit from microloan intermediaries to borrowers; and (2) $7,500 to $10,000 the loan limit to qualify for the lowest interest rate on such loans. Eliminates the requirement that all microloan loans be short-term. (Sec. 208) Revises the SBA program of Government contracts and business development assistance for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses to require Federal procuring agencies to first contract with the Administrator for the provision of needed goods or services, and the Administrator to then contract with eligible small businesses to meet such contractual requirements. (Currently, the Administrator enters into agreements with Federal agencies authorizing such agencies to contract directly with the participating small businesses.) Directs the Administrator to ensure that any subcontracts are fairly priced and that the contractor is capable of fulfilling the subcontract in a manner that improves the overall likelihood of success. Authorizes the procuring agency to administer the contract, including performance review and payment. Repeals the authority for procuring agencies to contract directly with participating small businesses. Requires: (1) the Administrator to identify potential awardees within three business days (subject to extension); (2) that a competition among possible participants be performed in the district office in which a substantial part of the work will be performed; and (3) the Administrator to consult with participating subcontractors on the terms and conditions of the contract. Directs the Administrator, in determining qualifying economic disadvantage of participating small businesses, to develop standards that compare the net worth of business owners who are claiming economic disadvantage to that of owners who are not socially disadvantaged. Prohibits the Administrator from establishing a net worth standard of less than $750,000. Requires calculations of economic disadvantage to exclude the applicant's equity in a principal residence and the business. Eliminates the requirement that the individual be economically disadvantaged in each year of program participation (thereby allowing improving firms to remain in the program). Requires program participants to file certifications regarding program compliance in the district office where the business is headquartered (currently, the SBA principal office). Prohibits an individual determined to be socially and economically disadvantaged from asserting such disadvantage with respect to any other concern, or a successor concern (requiring, in such cases, a new determination of eligibility). Prohibits the Administrator from imposing any restrictions on the management of a participating company except as such management would violate other eligibility provisions or Federal procurement law. Allows the logical business progression by a program participant into other areas of industrial endeavor. Requires appeals of SBA decisions with respect to an applicant's eligibility for program participation to be based on the record and the decision to be supported by substantial evidence. Requires the program to make a substantial effort to solicit applicants from small businesses located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas, within States having relatively few program participants, and from potentially eligible participants in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the program's authority. Requires: (1) each participant to annually prepare and submit to the Administrator a capability statement with respect to contract performance; and (2) the appropriate dissemination of such statements either locally (e.g., for local construction services) or nationally (for goods or services to be provided on a national basis).
