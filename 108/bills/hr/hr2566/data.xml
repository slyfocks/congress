Establishes an Office of Independent Review for project reviews.Requires information related to project analysis to be made available to the public on the Internet (with exceptions for trade secrets).Prohibits the authorization or substantial modification of a project unless it minimizes adverse impacts on the natural hydrologic patterns, value, or diversity of aquatic ecosystems.Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to require the full and concurrent mitigation of authorized projects.Requires the Secretary to establish a record keeping system to track wetland and other habitat types impacted by authorized projects.
