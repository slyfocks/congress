Amends the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act to expand its scope to include offenses relating to the financing of terrorism and violations of the Social Security Act relating to obtaining funds through the misuse of a social security number. Authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to investigate violations of money laundering and related offenses. Directs that a transaction or transfer of funds be considered to involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activity if it is part of a set of parallel or dependent transactions involving such proceeds. Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) provide for civil forfeiture to the United States of the assets of any individual or organization engaged in planning or perpetrating an act of international terrorism against any international organization or against any foreign government; and (2) establish procedures for contesting the confiscation of assets of suspected international terrorists. Amends the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in any judicial review of a finding of the existence of a primary money laundering concern the designation of which was based on classified information, to submit such information to the reviewing court ex parte and in camera."
