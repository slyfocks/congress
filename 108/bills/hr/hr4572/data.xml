  <summary>6/15/2004--Introduced.
Prohibits the Secretary of Defense from entering into any contract or agreement with the Government of Bulgaria concerning U.S. military cooperation with that Government within the territory of Bulgaria unless the Secretary certifies to Congress that U.S. citizens and corporations are afforded full due process in Bulgaria, which would be evidenced at least in part by the full and fair resolution of the claims of IBE Trade Corporation for the wrongful conversion of its shares of stock in a fertilizer plant located in Bulgaria, consistent with New York State court decisions.</summary>
