  <summary>10/30/2003--Introduced.
Juvenile Gun Crime Reporting Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit: (1) the sale or other disposition of a firearm or ammunition to any person who has been found by a court to be guilty of an act committed as a juvenile, which, if committed by an adult, would have been a crime of violence; and (2) the shipment or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce, or the possession in or affecting commerce, of a firearm or ammunition by such a person. Amends the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1988 to require a State, to be eligible for a grant under that Act, to provide assurances to the Attorney General that it has the capability and does contribute to a system for criminal justice identification, information, and communication, which identifies each such person.</summary>
