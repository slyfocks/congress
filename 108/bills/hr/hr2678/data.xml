  <summary>7/9/2003--Introduced.
Teachers for Tomorrow Act of 2003 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish new programs for teacher student loan forgiveness, under the guaranteed loan program and the direct loan program. Requires three consecutive complete school years of full-time teaching in a public elementary or secondary school as: (1) a secondary school teacher of a subject area relevant to the borrower's academic major; or (2) an elementary school teacher who has demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, mathematics, and other curriculum areas. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from a teacher's gross income any student loan amounts discharged under both the current HEA programs and those added by this Act.</summary>
