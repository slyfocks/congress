Directs the Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice to make grants to such units to establish or improve 911 service in those communities.Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, to make grants to establish in rural areas substance abuse (particularly methamphetamine) prevention and treatment pilot programs and methamphetamine prevention education programs. Directs the Attorney General to provide for the cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories and related hazardous waste, and for the improvement of contract-related response time for cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories and related hazardous waste by providing additional contract personnel, equipment, and facilities, in rural areas. Makes funding available from the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund for payment for the costs of experts and consultants needed to clean up areas formerly used as methamphetamine laboratories.
