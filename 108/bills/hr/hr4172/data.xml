  <summary>4/20/2004--Introduced.
Includes in the list of diseases presumed to be service-connected, in the case of radiation-exposed veterans, and therefore compensable for purposes of veterans' disability compensation and medical care, the following cancers: bone, brain, colon, lung, and ovarian. Includes as a covered radiation-risk activity service which, if performed as an employee of the Department of Energy, would qualify the individual for inclusion as a member of the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000. Provides that a radiation-exposed veteran who receives payment under provisions of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (such Act) shall not be deprived, because of such payment, of receipt of either veterans' disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation for service-connected radiation exposure, but there shall be deducted from the latter payment the amount of the payment under such Act.</summary>
