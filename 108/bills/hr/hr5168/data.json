    "text": "Bennett Freeze Rehabilitation Act of 2004 - Amends Federal law commonly referred to as the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act of 1974 to authorize the Commissioner of the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission to carry out a rehabilitation program to redress the effects of Federal development restrictions in the western portion of the Navajo Reservation (the Bennett Freeze, issued administratively in 1966 by former Bureau of Indian Affairs Commissioner Robert Bennett to restrict the Navajo tribe in Arizona from constructing and repairing their dwellings on land subject to a land dispute with the Hopi Tribe.) Limits such rehabilitation program to housing construction and renovation, infrastructure improvements, and economic development initiatives. Provides that, upon the Secretary of the Interior's approval of an agreement between the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe settling the land dispute over the lands subject to the Bennett Freeze, certain provisions of such Act concerning any development of lands in litigation are repealed."
