Allows the Secretary of Agriculture to reserve easements in the conveyance of National Forest System lands for access roads and trails, including perpetual unrestricted rights of pedestrian access to the Potholes trailhead of Los Padres National Forest. Requires the Secretary to provide reasonable access to privately owned inholdings in the District lands acquired under this Act. Stipulates that the District must construct a gravel parking area for the Potholes trailhead. Exempts water rights from this land exchange. Permits the District and the Secretary to equalize this exchange through a cash payment. Adds the District lands acquired under this Act to the Los Padres National Forest."
