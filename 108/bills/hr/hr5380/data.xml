Flight 587 Accountability Act - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to: (1) require each aircraft manufacturer to list any information in the limitation section of each flight manual that may affect the safe operation of an aircraft; and (2) resolve a dispute between an aircraft manufacturer and an aircraft operator that arises regarding the safe operation of an aircraft (except in cases in which an adjudicatory resolution is sought). Sets a deadline by which the Government Accountability Office must review the effectiveness and timeliness of the FAA in implementing recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board.</summary>
