Prohibits: (1) any State or political subdivision from enacting or enforcing any provision regulating such transactions; or (2) the delegation of such responsibility or authority to any State. Makes such reservation inapplicable to non-digital commercial transactions, and makes this Act inapplicable to Uniform Commercial Code requirements in effect in any State.</summary>
