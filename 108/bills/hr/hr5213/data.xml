Research Review Act of 2004 - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to report to specified congressional committees on the methods by which the Roadmap for Medical Research has advanced the use of multidisciplinary research teams and consortia of research institutions to advance treatments, develop new therapies, and collaborate on clinical trials, including with respect to spinal cord injury and paralysis research. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to report to such committees on: (1) the epidemiological studies currently underway at such Centers, future planned studies, the criteria involved in determining what epidemiological studies to conduct, defer, or suspend, and the scope of those studies, including with respect to the inflammatory bowel disease epidemiological study; and (2) CDC activities to establish partnerships with research and patient advocacy communities to expand epidemiological studies. Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to study and report to Congress on: (1) Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards that apply to patients with inflammatory bowel disease for specified therapies, taking into account appropriate outpatient or home health care delivery settings; and (2) the problems patients encounter when applying for disability insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act and recommendations for improving the application process for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</summary>
