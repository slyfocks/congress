Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund amounts equal to the recapture of corporate tax on account yields and of Government savings over baseline. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt the Social Security Personal Savings Fund and each Tier III Investment Option from income taxation. Subjects a personal Social Security savings account to taxes imposed on unrelated business income of charitable, etc. organizations. Excludes from a distributee's gross income any qualified distribution from amounts credited to a personal Social Security savings account from the Social Security Personal Savings Fund or held in a Tier III Investment Option. Creates in the Treasury the Self-Liquidating Social Security Transition Fund for the deposit of OASDI trust fund surplus for the preceding year.
