  <summary>6/16/2003--Introduced.
Native American Education Equity Act of 2003 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to establish a program that provides grants and related assistance to certain institutions of higher education (IHEs) serving Native Americans. Makes an IHE eligible for such program if it: (1) is eligible under HEA title III part A general provisions for aid for Strengthening Institutions, but is not eligible for certain programs for American Indian tribally controlled colleges and universities or for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions; and (2) has an undergraduate enrollment that is at least 15 percent students who are members of Indian tribes (or of Alaska Native villages or regional or village corporations). Sets forth examples of authorized activities to which grants may be applied such as: (1) buying, renting, or leasing scientific equipment for educational purposes; (2) renovating and improving classrooms and libraries; (3) supporting faculty exchanges and faculty fellowships; (4) funds and administrative management; and (5) academic tutoring and counseling programs. Directs the Secretary of Education to create a streamlined format enabling qualified institutions to apply for assistance.</summary>
