    "text": "The 9-11 Commission Combating Proliferation Implementation Act - Establishes within the Executive Office of the President the Office for Combating the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). Requires the Director to: (1) develop and advise the President on policies, goals, objectives, and priorities for preventing the proliferation of WMDs; (2) implement a comprehensive Strategy for Combating the Proliferation of WMDs (Strategy); and (3) direct development of an annual budget for programs and activities under the Strategy. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to carry out a program to undertake an accelerated, comprehensive worldwide effort to mitigate the threats posed by high-risk, proliferation-attractive fissile materials, radiological materials, and related equipment located at sites potentially vulnerable to theft or diversion. Requires the Secretary to submit classified interim and final reports on the program to Congress. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should strive to expand and strengthen the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI); and (2) the United States should engage the United Nations to develop a Security Council resolution authorizing the PSI under international law. Gives the President permanent waiver authority over legal provisions prohibiting the use of certain Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) funds for chemical weapons destruction facilities in Russia. Repeals a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 that limits CTR funds for activities outside the former Soviet Union. Requires the President to biannually report to Congress on liability concerns regarding, and impediments to, the renegotiation and implementation of specified nonproliferation agreements and programs."
