Lists the courts of record for Guam as the District Court of Guam, the Supreme Court of Guam, the Superior Court of Guam (except the Traffic and Small Claims divisions of the Superior Court of Guam), and any other local courts or divisions of local courts that the Supreme Court of Guam shall designate Outlines the jurisdiction and powers of the local courts. Provides that the qualifications and duties of the justices and judges of the courts shall be governed by the laws of Guam and the rules of such courts.
