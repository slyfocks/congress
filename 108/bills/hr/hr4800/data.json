    "text": "Specialty Crop and Value-Added Agriculture Promotion Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to make annual State grants (based upon value of production) to enhance specialty crop competitiveness. Stipulates that such grants shall supplement and not replace State funds. Defines \"specialty crop\" as any crop other than wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco. Amends the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 to replace the agricultural marketing resource center pilot project with a State block grant program for value-added agricultural product market development. Directs the Secretary to establish a quality standardization program for certification of farmers and processors under quality assurance systems, which shall include 50 percent reimbursement of participant certification costs. Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to direct the Commodity Credit Corporation to carry out the adjusted gross revenue insurance pilot program as a permanent program. Authorizes the Corporation to: (1) expand the program to cover any county in which crops are produced; and (2) grant temporary policy subsidies for producers located in a county that has a high level of specialty crop production and has not had a high level of crop insurance coverage coverage. Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary to: (1) make available to students in not more than 100 schools in each State, and in elementary and secondary schools on one Indian reservation, free fresh and dried fruits and vegetables throughout the school day in one or more school-designated areas; and (2) give priority to States that produce large quantities of specialty crops."
