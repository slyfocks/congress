Defines \"qualified intelligent systems property\" as any device installed by a motor vehicle manufacturer to enhance the safety or security of a driver, passenger, or load by, among other things, warning or informing a driver of dangerous driving conditions or by actively monitoring and adjusting driver workload. Terminates the deduction after 2010. Exempts intelligent vehicle systems properties from the first $5,000 of the excise tax on heavy trucks and trailers sold at retail."
