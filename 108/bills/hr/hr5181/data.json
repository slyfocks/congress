    "text": "Employee Freedom from Invasion of Privacy Act - Prohibits employers from engaging in video or audio monitoring of employees in restroom facilities, dressing rooms, or other areas in which it is reasonable to expect employees to change clothing. Establishes maximum civil penalties for violators. Requires the Secretary of Labor to: (1) provide written notice and an opportunity for a hearing before assessing penalties; and (2) determine the amount of penalties taking into account the nature of the violation and specified factors with respect to the violator. Authorizes judicial review of an assessment order for employers who requested a hearing. Authorizes the Attorney General to file suit to recover civil penalties assessed under this Act if an employer fails to pay. Authorizes the Secretary to commence civil actions for injunctive relief to prevent violations of this Act. Authorizes employees aggrieved by an employer's violation of this Act to commence a civil action against the employer for injunctive relief, damages (if the violation is knowing), or both. Asserts that this Act does not alter State law or collective bargaining agreements except where inconsistent with this Act."
