Indian Child Welfare Act Amendments of 2003 - Amends the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 concerning: (1) the application of the Act to any Indian child involved in a child custody proceeding regardless of whether such child has ever been part of an Indian family or maintained a social or cultural relationship with an Indian tribe; (2) jurisdiction over child custody and child adoption proceedings; (3) transfer of jurisdiction to tribal court; (4) intervention in state court proceedings, including the intervention rights of the extended family; (5) full faith and credit of tribal court judgments; (6) pending involuntary child custody proceedings, including a prohibition against prebirth involuntary custody proceedings; (7) voluntary termination of parental rights; (8) withdrawal of consent before a final decree; (9) notice to Indian tribes of the voluntary termination of parental rights or voluntary placement of a child; (10) intervention by an Indian tribe upon filing a notice of intent or a written objection; (11) written notice to parents of a terminated or changed adoptive placement or a commenced proceeding to adopt; (12) notice to extended family members; (13) invalidation of child custody proceedings; (14) expanded release of information concerning the tribal affiliation of biological parents; (15) assumption of jurisdiction over child custody proceedings by Indian tribes; (16) agreements between States and Indian tribes as they affect jurisdiction; (17) the content of notices with respect to pending involuntary child custody proceedings; (18) criminal sanctions for fraudulent representation during Indian child adoption proceedings; (19) visitation as an enforceable right; (20) Alaska Native postadoption inheritance rights; (21) promulgation of regulations governing compliance reviews; and (22) the application of these requirements to children of State-recognized and Canadian tribes.
