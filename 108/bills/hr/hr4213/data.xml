  <summary>4/22/2004--Introduced.
Requires an Indian tribe to meet specified criteria before Federal acknowledgement or recognition is granted. Amends the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to repeal the revolving door exemption that allows, under certain conditions, current and former Federal employees and officers assigned to or employed by an Indian tribe to act as agents or attorneys for or appear on behalf of such tribe in connection with matters pending before any department, agency, court, or commission, including matters in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest.</summary>
