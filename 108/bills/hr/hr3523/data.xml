  <summary>11/19/2003--Introduced.
Equity in Law Enforcement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include within the definition of "public safety officer" (thus qualifying for line-of-duty death and disability benefits) individuals serving private institutions of higher education in an official capacity as law enforcement officers, or employed by a rail carrier as police officers, who are sworn, licensed, or certified under State law for purposes of law enforcement and trained to meet training standards for law enforcement officers established by the relevant governmental appointing authority. Qualifies such officers serving private institutions of higher education and rail carriers under that Act's programs of matching grants for law enforcement armor vests and technical assistance to States and local governments.</summary>
