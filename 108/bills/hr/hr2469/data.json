Provides for standard and high option Medicare plans, while allowing certain Medicare beneficiaries to elect to retain their current Medicare benefits. Bases premiums on the beneficiary's level of income. Pays the entire premium in cases involving qualified low-income Medicare beneficiaries with income that does not exceed 200 percent of the official poverty line, with partial premium payments for other low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Establishes in the Treasury the Medicare Trust Fund, consisting in part of an appropriation of hospital insurance taxes from under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance), for paying the expenses incurred by this Act."
