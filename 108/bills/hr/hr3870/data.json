    "text": "Prescription Drug Abuse Elimination Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide grants to States to develop or enhance prescription drug monitoring programs, subject to specified requirements. Requires a dispenser to report to the State database when a patient presents a prescription for a Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require Internet pharmacies to meet specified criteria, including obtaining verification of a valid prescription in some circumstances. Allows district courts to order Internet providers to remove access to sites that violate this Act. Directs the Secretary to promulgate chain-of-custody requirements to track prescription drugs from the manufacturer through each importer, distributor, and retailer. Deems a drug misbranded if such requirements are not met. Amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to restrict the importation of a schedule II, III, or IV drug by a U.S. resident without a valid prescription to once during any 30-day period. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to convene a working group to study and report on pharmaceutical counterfeiting. Requires the Secretary to conduct research and report on issues related to prescription drug abuse. Requires the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to maintain a comprehensive, national database on deaths occurring as a result of substance abuse."
