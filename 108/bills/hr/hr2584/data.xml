  <summary>4/13/2004--Public Law.
Title I: Utrok Atoll Radiological Monitoring Support - (Sec. 101) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to convey to the Utrok Atoll local government a decommissioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ship in operable condition, in support of radiological monitoring, rehabilitation, and resettlement of Utrok Atoll, whose residents were affected by U.S. nuclear testing. Declares that the U.S. Government shall not be responsible or liable for any maintenance or operation of a vessel conveyed under Act after delivery of the vessel to Utrok. Directs the Utrok Atoll local government to submit to specified congressional committees a plan for the use of the conveyed vessel. Title II: Ratification of Certain NOAA Appointments, Promotions, and Actions - (Sec. 201) Ratifies and approves all action in the line of duty by, and all Federal agency actions in relation to, a de facto officer of the NOAA commissioned corps who was appointed or promoted to that office without Presidential action and without the advice and consent of the Senate. Authorizes the President to appoint or promote such a de facto officer as a corps officer for a period ending not later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, without change in the grade currently occupied in a de facto capacity. Title III: International Fisheries Reauthorization - International Fisheries Reauthorization Act of 2004 - (Sec. 302) Amends the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 to extend through FY 2008 the requirement that the Secretary of State enter agreements to reimburse owners of commercial fishing vessels seized and detained by a foreign country for actual costs, market value of confiscated or spoiled fish, and half of lost gross income. (Sec. 303) Amends the Yukon River Salmon Act of 2000 to extend through FY 2008 the authorization of appropriations for: (1) travel expenses of members and alternate members of the Yukon River Salmon Panel, U.S. members of a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) under the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada, and members of a specified advisory committee; (2) the U.S. share of expenses incurred by the JTC and any panel established by any agreement between the United States and Canada for restoration and enhancement of salmon originating in Canada; (3) activities by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce for survey, restoration, and enhancement activities related to salmon stocks originating from the Yukon River in Canada, including specified Yukon River salmon stock restoration and enhancement projects; and (4) cooperative salmon research and management projects in the portion of the Yukon River drainage located in the United States that are recommended by the Panel. (Sec. 305) Repeals a provision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 which prohibits funds under that Act from being obligated or expended to implement any measures to reduce overfishing and promote rebuilding of fish stocks managed under the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan other than measures set out in the NOAA final rule relating to provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Title IV: Pacific Albacore Tuna Treaty - (Sec. 401) Allows foreign fishing to be conducted pursuant to the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges, signed at Washington May 26, 1981, including its Annexes and any amendments thereto. Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to: (1) promulgate regulations for discharging U.S. obligations under such Treaty; and (2) apply such regulations to any person or vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction, wherever the person or vessel may be located. Requires enforcement of such provisions as if they were part of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. (Sec. 402) Amends the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988 to: (1) make certain prohibitions on South Pacific tuna fishing inapplicable to fishing by vessels using the longline method in the high seas areas of the Treaty on Fisheries Between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America; and (2) remove such prohibitions' inapplicability to vessels operating outside of the 200 nautical mile fisheries zones of the Pacific Island Parties.</summary>
