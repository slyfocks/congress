(Sec. 206) Amends Federal transportation law to authorize the Secretary to establish a motor carrier R&D program with respect to the causes of accidents, injuries, and fatalities involving commercial motor vehicles, including the means to reduce the number and severity of such accidents. Authorizes the Secretary to use program funds for training or education of commercial motor vehicle safety personnel, including, but not limited to, training in accident reconstruction and detection of controlled substances or other contraband, and stolen cargo or vehicles. Sets the Federal share of cost at 50 percent. (Sec. 207) Directs the Secretary, as part of the National Climate Change Technology Initiative and the Climate Change Research Initiative, to establish and carry out a multimodal energy and climate change program to study the relationship of transportation, energy, and climate change. Requires such program to include R&D designed to identify and evaluate: (1) strategies to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation sources; and (2) the potential effects of climate changes on the Nation's transportation systems, including strategies to address such effects. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2009. (Sec. 208) Amends Federal highway law to direct the Secretary to establish establish a national cooperative freight transportation R&D program that focuses on all forms of freight transportation, including trucking and rail. Establishes an advisory committee of freight stakeholders which shall recommend a national R&D agenda for the program, including a multi-year strategic plan. Allows such agenda to include R&D on: (1) techniques estimating public benefits derived from freight transportation projects; (2) alternative approaches to calculating the contribution of truck traffic to congestion on specific highway segments; (3) the use of technology applications to increase capacity of highway lanes dedicated to truck-only traffic; (4) development of policy alternatives for separating car and truck traffic; and (5) additional priorities to identify and address emerging R&D needs related to freight transportation. Sets the Federal share of costs at 100 percent. (Sec. 209) Directs the President to establish the Next Generation National Transportation Policy Study Commission to investigate and study the transportation needs, requirements, and policies of the United States through 2025. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2009. (Sec. 210) Directs the Secretary to establish a real-time system management information program to: (1) provide the nationwide capability to monitor, in real-time, the traffic and travel conditions of the Nation's major highways and share that information to improve the security of the surface transportation system, address congestion problems, support improved response to weather events, and facilitate national and regional traveler information; (2) provide a nationwide system of basic real-time information for managing and operating the Nation's surface transportation system; (3) identify longer range real-time highway and transit monitoring needs and develop plans and strategies for meeting those needs; and (4) provide the capability and means to share such data with State and local governments, and the traveling public. Directs the Secretary to establish data exchange formats to ensure that data provided by highway and transit monitoring systems, including statewide incident reporting systems, can readily be exchanged across jurisdictional boundaries, facilitating nation-wide availability of information. Requires each State to establish a statewide incident reporting system.
