Defines a \"covered policy\" as a life, property, liability, health annuity, dowry, educational, or casualty insurance policy issued to a policyholder domiciled in the area of Europe or Asia that was occupied or controlled by the Ottoman Empire and that was in effect at any time between 1875 and 1923. Declares that Congress explicitly disapproves any Executive branch policy or agreement that preempts State efforts to collect insurance information to resolve outstanding claims concerning such policies."
