Requires implementation of the program no later than one year after the beginning of the first full Federal migratory waterfowl hunting seasons after enactment of this Act and continuation of the program for three such seasons. Prohibits a State's participation in the program absent the Secretary's approval of an application providing details of the State's electronic stamp process. Requires the Secretary to publish: (1) deadlines for the submission of State applications; (2) eligibility requirements for program participation; and (3) criteria for selecting States for the program. Directs the Secretary to require participating States to: (1) provide an actual (paper) stamp to each individual to whom the State sells an electronic stamp by the date on which the electronic stamp expires; and (2) collect and transmit to the Secretary electronic stamp revenue and customer information. Authorizes participating States to charge a reasonable fee to cover program costs. Sets forth requirements for electronic stamps. Authorizes termination of a State's participation in the program by the Secretary, upon written notice, for violations of the terms of an approved application or by the State. Requires the Secretary to evaluate and report on the pilot program.</summary>
