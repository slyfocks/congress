  <summary>5/22/2003--Introduced.
Community Beaches Protection Act - Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from soliciting contributions from non-Federal interests for costs of constructing projects or measures for shore protection in excess of the non-Federal share assigned to flood control, nonstructural flood control measures, and certain other project purposes. Provides that such prohibition shall not limit the Secretary's authority to require non-Federal interests to pay the full cost of work performed outside the authorized scope of a project.</summary>
