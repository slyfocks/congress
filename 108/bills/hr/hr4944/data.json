Requires the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to administer the Trail. Allows the Secretary to establish and operate a Trail management office within the vicinity of the Trail. Requires the Secretary to establish and maintain a trail advisory committee to assist the Trail manager and staff with the operation of the Trail. Requires the Secretary to prepare a Cooperative Management and Interpretation Plan for the Trail to: (1) describe strategies for the coordinated development of the Trail; (2) identify potential partnering opportunities to develop interpretative facilities and educational programs; (3) confirm and expand upon the inventory of floods' features contained in a specified National Park Service study; and (4) review and modify the map of the Trail. Allows the Secretary to acquire not more than 25 acres of land for public information and administrative purposes to facilitate the geographic diversity of the Trail."
