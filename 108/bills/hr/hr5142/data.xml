  <summary>9/23/2004--Introduced.
Pitkin County Land Exchange Act of 2004 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) and the Secretary of the Interior, upon receipt of title to certain lands located in Pitkin County, Colorado, and certain lands located on Smuggler Mountain in the County, to convey to the County or to the Aspen Valley Land Trust, if the County so requests, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to certain National Forest and Bureau of Land Management lands located in the County. Prohibits the conveyance of a specified parcel to the County unless and until the County grants to the Aspen Valley Land Trust, the Roaring Fork Conservancy, or both, or to another entity mutually agreeable to the County and the Secretary of the Interior, a permanent conservation easement which provides public access to the parcel and limits future use of the parcel to recreational, fish, and wildlife conservation, and open space purposes. States that, prior to the conveyance to the County of a specified parcel, the County shall deliver to the Secretary a quitclaim deed to the parcel from any party who, prior to the introduction of this Act, had asserted a claim of any right, title, or interest in such parcel, and shall permanently relinquish any such claim against the United States in or to the parcel. States that lands acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this Act shall become part of White River National Forest.</summary>
