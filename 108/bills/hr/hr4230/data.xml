  <summary>4/28/2004--Introduced.
Global Anti-Semitism Awareness Act of 2004 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should continue to support efforts to combat anti-Semitism worldwide through bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations such as the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); (2) the U.S. delegation to the OSCE conference in Berlin should advocate for the appointment of a High Commissioner on anti-Semitism; and (3) the President should direct the United States Ambassador to the United Nations to introduce in the United Nations a measure condemning anti-Semitism. Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize and encourage the Secretary of State to establish within the Department of State an Office to Monitor and Combat anti-Semitism. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to include in the Department of State annual reports information on: (1) acts of anti-Semitism in foreign countries; and (2) governmental responses to such acts, including efforts to promote anti-bias education. Makes similar amendments to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.</summary>
