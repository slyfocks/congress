Prescribes the amount of royalty relief for specified suspension volumes of production. Prohibits the Secretary from granting the royalty incentives if the average annual NYMEX natural gas price exceeds for one full calendar year the threshold price of $5 per million Btu, adjusted from the year 2000 for inflation."
