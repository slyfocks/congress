Requires each local educational agency (LEA) receiving assistance under ESEA title I part A (I-A) to ensure that, by January 8, 2006, all such existing paraprofessionals working in I-A funded programs either have satisfied standards applicable to new paraprofessionals (as required for both groups under current law) or have met a rigorous standard of quality as demonstrated through an evaluation of: (1) performance of job duties that occur in the presence of students; and (2) knowledge of, and ability to assist in, instructing reading, writing, and mathematics (or readiness for these) at the grade level of the students to be instructed. Requires each State educational agency (SEA) receiving I-A assistance to develop, by January 8, 2005, procedures and criteria for such evaluations. Requires each evaluation to be conducted by an employee of a different LEA than the one the paraprofessional works for, or by an SEA employee. Requires SEAs to train or approve each employee who conducts such evaluations."
