  <summary>6/5/2003--Introduced.
American ParaProfessional Learning Equity Act of 2003 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, to revise standards for some paraprofessionals by providing an alternative standard of quality applicable to those hired before January 8, 2002 (existing paraprofessionals, as opposed to new ones hired after such date). Requires each local educational agency (LEA) receiving assistance under ESEA title I part A (I-A) to ensure that, by January 8, 2006, all such existing paraprofessionals working in I-A funded programs either have satisfied standards applicable to new paraprofessionals (as required for both groups under current law) or have met a rigorous standard of quality as demonstrated through an evaluation of: (1) performance of job duties that occur in the presence of students; and (2) knowledge of, and ability to assist in, instructing reading, writing, and mathematics (or readiness for these) at the grade level of the students to be instructed. Requires each State educational agency (SEA) receiving I-A assistance to develop, by January 8, 2005, procedures and criteria for such evaluations. Requires each evaluation to be conducted by an employee of a different LEA than the one the paraprofessional works for, or by an SEA employee. Requires SEAs to train or approve each employee who conducts such evaluations.</summary>
