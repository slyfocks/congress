  <summary>5/27/2003--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate on May 16, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 - Title I: Policy Planning and Coordination - (Sec. 101) Requires the President to establish a comprehensive, integrated, five-year strategy to combat the global spread of HIV and AIDS. Requires the President to report on such strategy to the appropriate congressional committees.Requires the Institute of Medicine to publish findings, within three years after enactment of this Act, comparing the success rates of the various programs and methods used under the strategy to reduce, prevent, and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.(Sec. 102) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to establish within the Department of State in the immediate office of the Secretary of State a Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.Requires the Coordinator to: (1) operate internationally to carry out prevention, care, treatment, support, capacity development, and other activities for combating HIV/AIDS; and (2) provide grants to, and enter into contracts with, nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based and community-based organizations, to carry out such activities.Establishes the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund which shall consist of authorization of appropriations for HIV/AIDS assistance.Title II: Support for Multilateral Funds, Programs, and Public-Private Partnerships - (Sec. 202) Authorizes the United States to participate in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Requires the President to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2008 for bilateral or multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria programs, including such sums as may be necessary for contributions to the Global Fund. Permits the reprogramming of certain FY 2001 funds under the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 to the Global Fund.Sets forth certain limits with respect to U.S. contributions to the Global Fund, providing for certain withholdings and shifting of funds in specified circumstances involving: (1) the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies of the Global Fund (including the Partnership Forum, the Foundation Board, the Secretariat, and the Technical Review Board); and (2) the salaries of Global Fund employees.Establishes in the Executive Branch an interagency technical review panel which shall serve as a "shadow" panel to the Global Fund. Requires the Comptroller General to monitor and evaluate projects funded by the Global Fund.Directs the Coordinator to make available to Congress upon request all financial and accounting statements for the Global Fund and the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund, auditing reports, project proposals which were not funded, and grantee progress reports.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should conduct an outreach campaign via the Internet and broadcast public service announcements to inform the public of the Global Fund and encourage private contributions to it.(Sec. 203) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize appropriations through FY 2008 for U.S. contributions to the Vaccine Fund, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, and the Malaria Vaccine Initiative of the Program for Appropriate Technologies in Health (PATH).Title II: Bilateral Efforts - Subtitle A: General Assistance and Programs - (Sec. 301) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize the President to provide assistance through nongovernmental organizations (including faith-based and community-based organizations) and coordination between international organizations for the prevention, treatment, monitoring, and control of: (1) HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and other countries and areas; (2) tuberculosis; and (3) malaria. Authorizes appropriations through FY 2008.Declares that an organization otherwise eligible to receive assistance to prevent, treat, or monitor HIV/AIDS shall not be required, as a condition of receiving the assistance, to: (1) endorse or utilize a multisectoral approach to combating HIV/AIDS; or (2) endorse, utilize, or participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the organization has a religious or moral objection.Expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. food assistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals.(Sec. 304) Urges the President to establish a program to demonstrate the feasibility of facilitating services of U.S. health care professionals in sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the world severely affected by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

(2) ensure that the financial benefits of debt cancellation are in addition to the government's total spending on poverty reduction for the previous year, or the average total of such expenditures for the previous three years, whichever is greater;
