Allied Health Professions Reinvestment Act of 2004 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue public service announcements that advertise and promote the allied health professions, highlight the advantages and rewards of those professions, and encourage individuals to enter those professions. Allows the Secretary to award grants to: (1) support similar State and local advertising campaigns; (2) improve the education, practice, and retention of allied health professionals through specified activities; and (3) develop and implement programs and initiatives to train and educate allied health professionals in providing geriatric care. Permits the Secretary to provide scholarships for the cost of tuition in exchange for students agreeing to serve as allied health professionals at health care facilities with critical shortages of such persons for not less than one year for each year of scholarship received. Allows the Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, to enter into an agreement with any higher education institution for the establishment and operation of a student loan fund to increase the number of qualified allied health professions faculty. Directs the Secretary to establish the Council on Health Profession Education in the Health Resources and Service Administration to monitor the status of the allied health professions workforce and make annual reports to Congress.</summary>
