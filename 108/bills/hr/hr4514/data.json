    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2004-06-04", 
    "text": "Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act of 2004 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to implement a competitive oil and gas leasing program for exploration and production of oil and gas resources of the Arctic Coastal Plain. Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal its prohibition against production of oil and gas from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including any leasing or development leading to such production. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) designate a maximum total of Coastal Plain acreage as a \"Special Area\" of unique character and interest; and (2) permit the use of horizontal drilling technology from lease sites located outside a Special Area. States that this Act constitutes the Secretary's sole authority to close Coastal Plain lands to oil and gas leasing, exploration, development, and production. Prescribes Coastal Plain environmental protection requirements. Expedites to 90 days the period of judicial review of any complaint. Limits the scope of such review to compliance with the terms of this Act. Exempts actions of the Secretary from judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement. Declares Title XI of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (governing transportation and utility systems in and across conservation system units) inapplicable to rights-of-way and easements issued by the Secretary for oil and gas transportation across the Coastal Plain. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) include rights-of-way and easements within the leasing program for lands across the Coastal Plain; and (2) convey the surface estate of specified lands to the Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, and the remaining subsurface estate beneath those lands to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Establishes the Coastal Plain Local Government Impact Aid Assistance Fund to provide limited financial assistance to eligible entities impacted directly by Coastal Plain oil and gas exploration or production."
