Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - (Sec. 401) Makes permanent (currently expires after September 30, 2003) the CIA voluntary separation incentive program. Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to authorize the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to take certain actions to: (1) protect from unauthorized disclosure intelligence operations, the identities of undercover intelligence officers, intelligence sources and methods, or intelligence cover mechanisms; or (2) meet special requirements of work related to the collection of foreign intelligence or other authorized activities.

Requires students receiving such scholarship, fellowship, or grant assistance to enter into a service agreement with the head of the IC element providing the assistance to serve two years for each year of assistance provided, and to reimburse the United States with respect to obligated service not completed. Authorizes the appropriate IC head to release an employee from the reimbursement obligation when equity or the interests of the United States so require. Directs the Secretary of Defense to take appropriate steps to increase the number of qualified educational institutions that receive grants under the National Flagship Language Initiative to establish, operate, or improve activities designed to train such students.

Requires such students to enter into a service agreement to work in an appropriate national security position thereafter. Requires the DNI to transfer funds from the ICM Account to the Secretary of Defense, beginning with the 2005 fiscal year, to carry out such student training program. Subtitle B: Improvements in Intelligence Community Foreign Language Skills - (Sec. 611) Prohibits an individual from being appointed to a position in the Senior Intelligence Service in the Directorate of Intelligence or Directorate of Operations of the CIA unless the DCI determines that such individual is: (1) certified as having a professional speaking and reading proficiency in a foreign language; and (2) able to communicate the priorities of the United States and exercise influence in that foreign language. Requires the DCI to report to Congress on any appointments that should be exempt from such language requirement. (Sec. 612) Authorizes the Secretary of Defense and DNI to jointly carry out a program to advance foreign language skills in languages that are critical to the capability of the IC to carry out U.S. national security objectives.

Authorizes the DNI to reimburse students for education and training costs. (Sec. 613) Directs the DNI to conduct a three-year pilot project to assess the feasibility and advisability of establishing a Civilian Linguist Reserve Corps comprised of U.S. citizens with advanced levels of proficiency in foreign languages who would be available upon the call of the DNI to perform in the IC such service or duties with respect to such languages as the DNI may specify. Requires the DNI to submit to Congress an initial and final report on the pilot project. Authorizes appropriations.
