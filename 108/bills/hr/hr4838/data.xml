Healthy Forest Youth Conservation Corps Act of 2004 - Establishes A Healthy Forest Youth Conservation Corps to be composed of young adults (ages 16 to 25) enrolled as members of a service and conservation corps covered by a contract or cooperative agreement to work on projects to prevent fire and suppress fires, rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires, and provide disaster relief. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretaries) to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements directly with any service and conservation corps or State department of natural resources, agriculture, or forestry to carry out such projects. Directs the Secretaries to give priority to certain projects, including projects that will: (1) reduce hazardous fuels on public lands; (2) restore public land affected or threatened by disease or insect infestation; (3) rehabilitate public land affected or altered by fires; (4) assess windthrown public land or public land at a high risk of reburn; (5) address public land located near a municipal watershed and water supply; (6) provide emergency assistance; (7) instill a work ethic in corps members; (8) be labor-intensive; and (9) be planned and initiated promptly. Allows corps members under age 18 to perform certain activities as part of a rehabilitation and enhancement project under a contract or cooperative agreement. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2005 through FY 2009.</summary>
