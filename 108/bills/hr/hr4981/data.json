Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the heads of other Federal agencies to execute and perform all actions that are necessary to carry out the Agreement. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for a one-time payment to local governments to mitigate for the change of use of water acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation. Requires the Secretary to transfer land selected by the Tribe to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be held in trust for the Tribe. Provides that the consumptive use and the springs or fountains water rights be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe. Requires the Tribe to enact a water code to be approved by the Secretary. Establishes: (1) the Nez Perce Tribe Water and Fisheries Fund for the Tribe to acquire land and water rights, restore or improve fish habitat, or for fish production, agricultural development, cultural preservation, water resource development, or fisheries-related projects; (2) the Nez Perce Domestic Water Supply Fund to pay for the design and construction of water supply and sewer systems for tribal communities; and (3) the Salmon and Clearwater River Basins Habitat Fund to pay for habitat protection and restoration in the Salmon and Clearwater River basins. Sets forth waiver and release provisions. Allows the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make a grant to the City of Blackfoot, Idaho to assist with natural resource restoration and conservation and water resource development associated with the Jensen Grove Lake."
