Prohibits CAP water from being leased or otherwise transferred for use outside the State, with exceptions. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary and the State to develop a firming program to ensure that 60,648 acre-feet of the agricultural priority water made available pursuant to the master agreement and reallocated to Arizona Indian tribes shall, for a 100-year period, be delivered during water shortages in the same manner as water with municipal and industrial delivery priority in the CAP system. Requires: (1) the Secretary to firm 28,200 acre-feet of agricultural priority water reallocated to the Tohono O'odham Nation and 8,724 acre-feet of such water reallocated to Arizona Indian tribes; and (2) the State to firm 15,000 acre-feet of agricultural priority water reallocated to the Community and 8,724 acre-feet of such water reallocated to Arizona Indian tribes and to assist the Secretary in carrying out obligations in accordance with the Southern Arizona Water Rights Settlement Amendments Act (as added by Title III of this Act). (Sec. 106) Ratifies the master agreement. (Sec. 107) Amends the Colorado River Basin Project Act to authorize additional uses of revenue funds.
