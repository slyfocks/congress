Requires such organizations to file monthly reports in any calendar year in which they accept a contribution or make an expenditure for an exempt function and to file a single year-end report not later than January 31 of the following calendar year. Eliminates the quarterly reporting requirement in calendar years in which a regularly scheduled election is held."
