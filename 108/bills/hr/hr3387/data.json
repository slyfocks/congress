    "text": "Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2003 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish care to a newborn child of a veteran who is receiving maternity care furnished through the Department of Veterans Affairs for up to 14 days after the birth of the child if the veteran delivered the child in a Department facility or a non-Department facility under a Department contract for delivery services. Repeals a provision which excludes certain vocational rehabilitation services from those authorized to be provided to ill or disabled veterans. Authorizes the Secretary to furnish: (1) work skills training and development services; (2) employment support services; and (3) job development and placement services. Extends through 2008 Department authority to provide specialized hospital, medical, and nursing home care to: (1) Vietnam-era herbicide-exposed veterans; and (2) Persian Gulf War veterans. Requires an individual applying for any medical care through the Department to furnish the Secretary with information on any health-plan contract under which such individual is covered. Authorizes the Secretary to deny any application not containing such information. Extends through: (1) 2008 Department authority to lease to nonprofit organizations or States real property on which veterans have defaulted on Department-guaranteed loans; (2) 2009 certain annual reports; and (3) 2008 the provision of readjustment counseling for Vietnam-era veterans. Makes permanent (currently expires December 31, 2004) Department authority to provide sexual trauma counseling to veterans."
