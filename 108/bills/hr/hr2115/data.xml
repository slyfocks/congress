Authorizes appropriations out of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for FY 2004 through 2007 to gather and analyze aviation data in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Department of Transportation (DOT). (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for aviation programs. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary of Transportation (Secretary) to ensure that an agreement between the U.S. Government and a qualified entity, State, or local government allowing the entity, State, or local government to operate an airport facility relieves the U.S. Government from any liability arising out of, or related to, acts or omissions of entity, State, or local employees in operating such facility. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 through 2007 for the air traffic control contract program (now made permanent). Increases the maximum Federal share of costs for the construction of a nonapproach traffic control tower from $1.1 million to $1.5 million. (Sec. 106) Authorizes the Secretary to provide insurance in excess of the greater amount of available primary insurance or $50 million to aircraft manufacturers for loss or damage resulting from operation of an aircraft by a domestic carrier and involving war and terrorism. Authorizes the Secretary to extend to the U.S. manufacturer of the aircraft of the air carrier involved the limitation of $100 million in liability for third party claims arising out of acts of terrorism, as well as immunity from punitive damages (with the Federal Government responsible for any liability above $100 million). Extends the current authority of the Secretary to provide air carrier insurance and reinsurance through March 30, 2008. Subtitle B: Passenger Facility Fees - (Sec. 121) Includes among eligible airport-related projects financed through a passenger facility fee a project in an air quality nonattainment or maintenance area for: (1) the conversion of vehicles and ground support equipment used at a commercial service airport to low-emission technology or to use cleaner burning conventional fuels; (2) the retrofitting of such vehicles or equipment powered by a diesel or gasoline engine with EPA-certified emission control technologies; or (3) the acquisition of airport vehicles and ground support equipment that include low-emission technology or use cleaner burning fuels. Requires such a project to result in an airport's receiving appropriate emission credits. Limits the maximum cost that may be financed by imposition of a passenger facility fee for such low-technology projects. (Sec. 122) Declares that the Secretary may authorize use of a passenger facility fee for making debt service payments on indebtedness incurred to carry out at the airport a project that is not an eligible airport-related project, provided the Secretary determines that such use is necessary owing to the airport's financial need. (Sec. 123) Revises certain passenger facility fee requirements to provide that an eligible agency applying to impose a passenger facility fee that provides notice and an opportunity for consultation to an domestic or foreign air carrier is deemed to have satisfied certain application requirements if it limits such notices and consultations to domestic and foreign air carriers that have a significant business interest at an airport, that is, one: (1) that had at least one percent of passenger boardings at the airport in the prior calendar year, and which amounted to at least 25,000 such boardings; or (3) provides scheduled service at the airport. Requires an eligible agency to provide reasonable notice and an opportunity for public comment before submitting an application to the Secretary. Changes from mandatory to discretionary the authority of the Secretary, after receiving an application, to provide notice and an opportunity to domestic and foreign air carriers and other interested persons to comment on the application. Establishes a pilot program to test alternative procedures for authorizing eligible agencies for nonhub airport to impose passenger facility fees. Authorizes an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee at a nonhub airport. Sets forth program requirements. Prohibits the collection of a passenger facility fee from a passenger enplaning at an airport on a military charter flight paid for by the Department of Defense. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to publish in the Federal Register the current Administration policy on the eligibility of airport ground access transportation projects for the use of passenger facility fees. (Sec. 124) Requires an air carrier to segregate passenger facility revenue in a separate account for the benefit of the eligible agencies entitled to such revenue. Prohibits an air carrier from granting to a third party any security or other interest in such revenue. Entitles an air carrier that collects passenger facility fees to receive interest on passenger facility fee accounts. Subtitle C: AIP Modifications - (Sec. 141) Makes eligible for airport development project funds routine work to preserve and extend the useful life of runways, taxiways, and aprons at nonhub airports. (Sec. 142) Requires funding of the replacement of baggage conveyor systems, and reconfiguration of terminal baggage areas, at public-use airports in order to install bulk explosive detection devices to use only amounts apportioned for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and programs. (Sec. 143) Amends the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 to repeal (in order to conform with this Act) certain authority to use certain funds for specified airport security programs and activities. (Sec. 144) Revises requirements for audit certifications with respect to assurances about airport operations necessary for project grant application approval. (Sec. 145) Makes an allowable airport development project cost the cost of moving a Federal facility impeding an airport development project, if the rebuilt facility is of an equivalent size and type. (Sec. 146) Authorizes the Secretary to apportion airport improvement funds to primary airports for FY 2004 and 2005 in the same amount apportioned to such airports for FY 2002 or 2003 (whichever is greater), provided the Secretary finds that: (1) passenger boardings at the airport were below 10,000 in calendar year 2002 or 2003; (2) the airport had at least 10,000 passenger boardings and scheduled passenger aircraft service in either calendar year 2000 or 2001; and (3) the reason that passenger boardings were below 10,000 was the decrease in passengers following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. (Sec. 147) Increases from three percent to 3.5 percent the mandatory annual apportionment of airport improvement amounts to sponsors of airports served by aircraft transporting only cargo with a total annual landed weight of more than 100 million pounds. (Sec. 148) Revises factors the Secretary must consider in selecting a project for a discretionary grant to preserve and improve airport capacity. Sets forth certain other factors that must be considered in selecting an airport development project for a discretionary grant, including whether: (1) funding has been approved for all other projects qualifying for funding during the fiscal year that have attained a higher score under the numerical priority system employed by the Secretary in administering the discretionary fund; and (2) the airport sponsor will be able to commence the work identified in the project application in the fiscal year in which the grant is made, or within six months afterwards, whichever is later. (Sec. 149) Authorizes the Secretary to decide that the costs of revenue producing aeronautical support facilities (including fuel farms and hangars) are allowable costs payable by the Government for an airport development project at a nonprimary airport if: (1) the Government's share of such costs is paid only with funds apportioned to an airport sponsor (except for primary airports) under the special rule for fiscal years with $3.2 billion or more available;and (2) the sponsor has made adequate provision for financing airside needs of the airport. Revises the authorization of an agreement between the sponsor of an airport and the Secretary to waive the sponsor's claim to any part of airport improvement funds apportioned for the airport if the Secretary agrees to make the waived amount available for a grant for another public-use airport in the same State or geographical area. Extends such waiver authorization to apportionments under the special rule for fiscal years with $3.2 billion or more available. Authorizes the Secretary to make any part of airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and program funds apportioned to a sponsor of a nonprimary airport under the special rule available to pay the costs for terminal development at such airport. (Sec. 150) Revises entitlement to the availability of airport improvement apportionments for three years following the original fiscal year by: (1) repealing such entitlement for any primary airport that had less than .05 percent of the total boardings in the United States in the preceding calendar year; and (2) extending such entitlement to a nonhub airport or any airport that is not a commercial service airport. (Sec. 151) Increases from 34 percent to 35 percent of amounts available to the discretionary fund for each fiscal year that the Secretary is required to use for grants for for airport noise compatibility planning and programs (as under current law). Includes among the purposes of such grants: (1) carrying out noise mitigation projects approved in an environmental record of decision for an airport development project; (2) compatible land use planning and projects carried by State and local governments; and (3) airport development projects to comply with the Clean Air Act. (Sec. 152) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot grant program to support through the award of grants the purchase, by a State or local government, of development rights associated with, or directly affecting the use of, privately owned public use airports located in the State. Sets forth certain grant requirements and standards. (Sec. 153) Increases the availability of funds from the discretionary fund for FY 2004 and 2005 to sponsors of current or former military airports to improve or repair terminal building facilities, or to construct, improve, or repair certain airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, and utilities, and hangars and air cargo terminals at such airports. (Sec. 154) Revises the authority of the Administrator of the FAA to contract, using sole source or limited source authority, for the collection of airport safety data. Authorizes cooperative agreements with or and grants to a private company for the collection of such data. Makes the Federal share of cost of the data collection 100 percent. (Sec. 155) Revises requirements regarding an airport sponsor's sale or long term lease of a general aviation or other type airport to a private person. Revises the Secretary's authority to approve a sponsor's application for an exemption from certain restrictions and assurances regarding the use of local aviation fuel taxes and airport revenues. Allows such an exemption to the extent necessary to permit the sponsor to recover from such sale or lease an amount as may be approved: (1) in the case of a primary airport, by at least 65 percent of the scheduled air carriers serving the airport (currently, by at least 65 percent of the air carriers serving the airport), and by scheduled and nonscheduled air carriers whose aircraft landing at the airport during the preceding calendar year, had a total landed weight during the preceding calendar year of at least 65 percent of the total landed weight of all aircraft landing at the airport during such year (currently a requirement with respect to all airports); or (2) by the Secretary at any nonprimary airport after the airport has consulted with at least 65 percent of the owners of aircraft based at that airport. Deems an air carrier to have approved a sponsor's application fro an exemption unless it submits an objection in writing to the sponsor by a certain deadline. (Sec. 157) Requires the Secretary, in cooperation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to administer the airport security program. (Sec. 158) Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue guidance on how to ensure that airport sponsors receive appropriate emission credits for carrying out air quality projects at certain airports. Sets forth certain requirements for such guidance. (Sec. 159) Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program under which airport sponsors may use airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning and program funds to retrofit existing eligible airport ground support equipment that burns conventional fuels to achieve lower emissions utilizing emission control technologies certified or verified by the EPA. Limits eligibility for such program to commercial service airports in air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas (proper areas). Makes eligible for airport development project funds: (1) work necessary to construct or modify airport facilities to provide low-emission fuel systems, gate electrification, and other related air quality improvements at a commercial service airport provided the airport is located in a proper area, and such project will result in an airport receiving appropriate emission credits; and (2) a project for the acquisition or conversion of vehicles and ground support equipment owned by a commercial service airport to low-emission technology provided the airport is located in a proper area, and such project will result in an airport receiving appropriate emission credits. Declares an allowable cost the cost for a project for acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles and certain ground support equipment owned by a airport that include low-emission technology, but only to the extent of the incremental cost of equipping such vehicles or equipment with low-emission technology. Defines low-emission technologies technology for vehicles and equipment whose emission performance is the best achievable under EPA emission standards, relying exclusively on alternative fuels that are substantially non-petroleum based, but not excluding hybrid systems or natural gas powered vehicles. (Sec. 160) Authorizes the Secretary to make grants from amounts set aside for noise compatibility programs, under the special rule for fiscal years with $3.2 billion or more available, to State and local governments for land use compatibility plans and resulting projects to make the use of land areas around large hub airports and medium hub airports compatible with aircraft operations if certain requirements are met. Sets forth certain grant requirements. (Sec. 161) Increases from 90 to 95 percent for FY 2004 through 2007 the Federal Government's share of costs for specified airport projects funded under the State airport block grant program. (Sec. 162) Sets forth a formula and related requirements for an increase in the Government's share of allowable project costs in the case of any project approved after September 30, 2003, at a small hub airport or nonhub airport that is located in a State containing unappropriated and unreserved public lands and nontaxable Indian lands (individual and tribal) of more than five percent of the total area of all lands in the State. (Sec. 163) Increases from 40 percent to 70 percent the Federal share of a pilot project for private ownership of airports funded by the Administrator from the discretionary fund. (Sec. 164) Revises requirements for the written assurances the Secretary must receive before approving an application for an airport development project grant for acquiring land for a noise compatibility purpose. Requires the assurances about reinvestment in an approved noise compatibility project as an alternative use of proceeds from disposition of the land to include the purchase of nonresidential buildings or property in the vicinity of residential buildings or property previously purchased by the airport as part of a noise compatibility program. (Sec. 165) Adds to the written assurances the Secretary must receive before approving an application for an airport development project grant assurance that, if the airport owner or operator and a person who owns an aircraft agree that a hangar is to be constructed at the airport for the aircraft at the aircraft owner's expense, the airport owner or operator will grant the aircraft owner a long-term lease for the hangar. (Sec. 166) Revises requirements for the use of apportionments to repay money borrowed for terminal development costs to cover apportionments for grants to a nonhub primary airport which is a designated current or former military airport in FY 2003 at which terminal development is carried out between January 2003 and August 2004. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 181) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to authorize an airport sponsor, upon application approval, to award a design-build contract (an agreement providing for both design and construction of a project by a contractor) using a selection process permitted under applicable State or local law if specified general requirements are met. Allows the Administrator to reimburse an airport sponsor for design and construction costs incurred before a grant is made for a design-build contract if the project is approved by the Administrator in advance and is carried out in accordance with all administrative and statutory requirements that would have been applicable if the project were carried out after a grant agreement had been executed. (Sec. 182) Authorizes the FAA Administrator to establish a pilot program to test innovative financing techniques through amending a contract for between one and 20 fiscal years to purchase and install air traffic control equipment for the Administration. Limits such an amendment to between one and ten fiscal years. Allows such a contract to contain a cancellation clause, with a cancellation liability schedule covering reasonable and allocable costs incurred through the cancellation date plus reasonable profit, if any, on those costs. Allows the Administrator to may make an advance contract provision to achieve economic-lot purchases and more efficient production rates. Prohibits the Administrator from making any such contract amendments until the program for the terminal automation replacement systems has been rebaselined in accordance with the FAA acquisition management system. Makes specified funding available. (Sec. 183) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a cost-sharing program under which the Secretary may make grants of up to $5 million per project for up to ten eligible air traffic modernization projects per fiscal year for the purpose of improving aviation safety and enhancing mobility of the Nation's air transportation system by encouraging non-Federal investment in critical air traffic control equipment and software. Limits the Federal share of costs to 33 percent. Requires the non-Federal share to be provided from non-Federal sources, including revenues collected from passenger facility fees. (Sec. 184) Requires the FAA Administrator to report biannually for four years to specified congressional committees on the ten largest air navigation facilities and equipment programs, any budget changes in them, program schedules, and associated technical risks. (Sec. 185) Amends Federal aviation law to prohibit a public agency (a State or local government, a tax-supported organization, or an Indian tribe or pueblo) from closing permanently an airport listed in the national plan of integrated airport systems without providing written notice to the FAA Administrator at least 30 days before the date of the closure. Establishes a civil penalty of $10,000 per day of closure without notice for any violation of this requirement. (Sec. 186) Directs the Secretaries of Transportation, Defense, Interior, and Homeland Security to enter into a memorandum of understanding to facilitate the sale of aircraft fuel on Midway Island at a price that will generate sufficient revenue to improve the airport's ability to operate on a self-sustaining basis in accordance with FAA standards applicable to commercial airports. Requires the memorandum also to address the long-range potential of promoting tourism as a means to generate revenue to operate the airport. Authorizes the Midway Island Airport to transfer, without consideration, to the FAA Administrator the navigation aids at the airport, and requires the Administrator to accept, operate, and maintain them. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to enter into a reimbursable agreement with the Secretary of the Interior to fund, out of the Secretary of Transportation's discretionary fund, airport development at Midway Island Airport (up to $2.5 million per year) for fiscal years ending before October 1, 2007. (Sec. 187) Amends Federal aviation law with regard to intermodal planning to add to the environmental requirements for approval of an airport development project involving the location of an airport, runway, or major runway extension at a medium or large hub airport. Requires the airport sponsor to have made available and provided upon request to the metropolitan planning organization in the area in which the airport is located, if any, a copy of the proposed amendment to the airport layout plan to depict the project and a copy of any airport master plan in which the project is described or depicted. (Sec. 188) Makes the sponsors of airports located in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Republic of Palau eligible for discretionary fund and small airport grants for FY 2004 through 2007. (Sec. 189) Prohibits the Secretary from approving in FY 2004 through 2007 any noise compatibility program submitted if it requires the expenditure of certain funds made available for mitigation of aircraft noise less than 65 DNL. (Sec. 190) Offers the Chaluka Corporation (the village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) for the Native Village of Nikolski, Alaska) ownership of the surface estate in the former Nikolski Radio Relay Site on Umnak Island, Alaska, and the Aleut Corporation (the regional corporation established under ANCSA for the region in which the Native Village of Nikolski, Alaska, is located) the subsurface estate of that Site, in exchange for relinquishment by the Chaluka Corporation and the Aleut Corporation of specified property. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey the offered land if the Chaluka Corporation and the Aleut Corporation take the actions specified actions. Declares that neither the Chaluka Corporation nor the Aleut Corporation shall be subject to any liability for: (1) the presence or release of a hazardous substance on Phase I lands or the presence of solid waste on Phase I lands, which predates their conveyance to the Chaluka and Aleut Corporations; or (2) any release, from any of such hazardous substances or solid wastes following conveyance of Phase I lands, so long as the presence of or releases from those hazardous substances or solid wastes are not the result of actions by the Chaluka Corporation or the Aleut Corporation. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, at no cost to the recipient, convey ownership of an estate in fee simple in: (1) each specified Lot that is the subject of an Aleutian Housing Authority mutual help occupancy agreement, to the Aleutian Housing Authority (and the remainder of such Lots to the current occupants); and (2) the Nikolski powerhouse land, to the Indian Reorganization Act Tribal Government for the Native Village of Nikolski, upon completion of a certain environmental restoration if after the restoration the powerhouse continues to be located on the Nikolski powerhouse land, or the surface estate to the Chaluka Corporation and the subsurface estate to the Aleut Corporation, if after the restoration, the Nikolski powerhouse is no longer located on the Nikolski powerhouse land. Authorizes the Denali Commission to arrange for environmental restoration of the areas on, beneath, and adjacent to the Nikolski powerhouse land that are contaminated as a result of powerhouse operations and activities. Makes it a condition of the land conveyance that the Chaluka Corporation shall permit the U.S. Government, and its agents, employees, and contractors, to have unrestricted access to the airfield at Nikolski in perpetuity for site investigation, restoration, remediation, and environmental monitoring of the former Nikolski Radio Relay Site and reasonable access to that airfield, and to other land conveyed under this Act, for any activity associated with management of lands owned by the United States and for other governmental purposes without cost to the Government.
