  <summary>3/11/2003--Introduced.
Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2003 - Directs the Archivist of the United States to establish and maintain a Holocaust Insurance Registry of information on holders, issuers, and related liable entities of Holocaust-era insurance policies that were: (1) in effect after January 30, 1933, and before December 31, 1945; and (2) issued to a policyholder domiciled in any area of Europe that was occupied or controlled by Nazi Germany or any ally or sympathizer during such period. Requires: (1) insurers to file such information in an electronic format with the Secretary of Commerce by a specified deadline; (2) the Secretary to assess a civil penalty for each day of insurer noncompliance; and (3) the Secretary to notify each State's commissioner of insurance of the identity of any insurer that has failed to file either such information or to satisfy such civil penalty. Declares that nothing in this Act preempts the right of any State to adopt or enforce any State law requiring an insurer to disclose information regarding insurance policies that may have been confiscated or stolen from victims of Nazi persecution. Expresses the sense of Congress that if any litigation challenging such a State law is dismissed because the State's commissioner of insurance chooses to rely on this Act and therefore no longer seeks to enforce the State law, each party should bear its own legal fees and costs.</summary>
