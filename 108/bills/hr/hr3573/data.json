    "text": "North Korean Freedom Act of 2003 - Requires reports on: (1) the North Korean prison and labor camp system, focusing on prisons housing political prisoners; (2) U.S. Government policies toward North Korean defectors; (3) measures taken to facilitate access to the U.S. refugee program for individuals who have fled countries for religious freedom violations; and (4) funding for, and use of Federal resources by, entities that provide humanitarian or food aid to North Korea. Provides for: (1) public interest parole for North Koreans who are victims of North Korean Government malfeasance; (2) adjustment of status of a North Korean alien who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States after July 1, 2003, and who has been present in the United States for a year to alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Deems extraordinary and temporary conditions to exist that prevent such aliens from returning to North Korea in safety. Expands the S visa classification to include an alien who possesses and is willing to supply critical information concerning activities relating to weapons of mass destruction or delivery systems. Establishes within the Department of Homeland Security a Weapons of Mass Destruction Informant Center. Authorizes grants: (1) to organizations that provide assistance to persons attempting to escape North Korea, to North Korean orphans, or to North Koreans applying for U.S. admission; and (2) to promote human rights dialogue, programs for democracy, good governance, and the rule of law, and market economies in North Korea. Requires the Broadcasting Board of Governors to report a plan for increasing U.S. broadcasts to North Korea to 24 hours per day. Authorizes appropriations for making available to North Koreans radios for receiving outside broadcasts. Sets forth conditions that must be satisfied by the North Korean Government before U.S. entities may provide humanitarian or non-humanitarian aid. Directs the President to establish an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat North Korean Criminal Activities."
