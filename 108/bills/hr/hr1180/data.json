Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to establish minimum Federal fleet requirements with respect to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Establishes, as a goal, to replace reliance on 30 million barrels of foreign oil through the use of hydrogen fuel cells by December 31, 2012. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish an advisory commission regarding the commercialization of fuel cell motor vehicles, including the achievement of the above goal."
