States that nothing in this Act may be construed to relieve the Administrator, other Federal agency heads, or potentially liable parties of legal liability with respect to site cleanup. Directs the Administrator to: (1) study possible long-term solutions to remediate the site and provide a clean drinking water source for Wauconda residents; and (2) recommend and implement a long-term solution to provide a clean drinking water source for such residents. Requires the Administrator to work with the heads of other appropriate Federal and State agencies to seek a comprehensive resolution to the short- and long-term environmental and health problems related to the site."
