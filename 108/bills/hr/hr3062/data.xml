  <summary>10/8/2003--Passed House amended.
Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue separately, for the same area, a lease for tar sand and a lease for oil and gas. Declares that such a lease shall not be further subject to the Combined Hydrocarbon Leasing Act of 1981. Requires a lease for tar sand to be issued using the same bidding process, annual rental, and posting period as a lease issued for oil and gas. Sets the minimum acceptable bid for a tar sand lease at $2 per acre. Authorizes the Secretary, in order to promote any resource covered by a combined hydrocarbon lease, to waive, suspend, or alter any requirement that a permittee under a permit authorizing prospecting for tar sand must exercise due diligence.</summary>
