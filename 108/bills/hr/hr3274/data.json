Directs the Governor, in States that do not have regional councils, to work with local officials to organize a regional approach involving local elected officials and establish a homeland defense regional planning advisory committee. Sets forth minimum elements of regional plans, including: (1) disaster, response equipment and personnel, and equipment needs assessments; (2) development of a regional communication system and a secure information repository; (3) emergency coordination information; and (4) specified elements regarding support facilities, infrastructure, transportation facilities, at-risk populations, potential targets, and debris disposal. Directs that planning activities include: (1) analyzing and documenting the possibility of a disaster and the potential consequences or impacts upon life, property, and the environment; and (2) planning for utilization of geographic information systems to assess hazards and evaluate the consequences of potential emergencies or disasters. Sets forth provisions regarding approval and updating of regional plans, the security of mapping and infrastructure information, and funding apportionment. Authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to withhold, reduce, or deny an apportionment if the Secretary determines that the State or regional council has not complied, or provided adequate assurances that it will comply, with this Act's requirements."
