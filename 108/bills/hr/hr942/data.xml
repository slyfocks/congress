  <summary>2/26/2003--Introduced.
Consolidation Student Loan Flexibility Act of 2003 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to allow student loan borrowers to choose a lender for loan consolidation. (Eliminates the requirement that: (1) the consolidation loan lender must already hold an outstanding student loan of the borrower; or (2) the borrower must certify to having sought and been unable to obtain a consolidation loan with income-sensitive repayment terms from any holders of the outstanding loans selected for consolidation.)</summary>
