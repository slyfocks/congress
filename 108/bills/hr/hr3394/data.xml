States that no Indian tribe shall have jurisdiction over, or shall exercise governmental power within, any land that is not located in the same State as the reservation, trust lands, or other tribal lands that constituted the principal residence and location of that Indian tribe on the enactment of this Act, unless such land is: (1) contiguous to the lands that constituted the principal residence and location of the Indian tribe as of the enactment; or (2) has been taken into trust. Provides that an Indian tribe that had no such reservation, trust lands, or other tribal lands shall not have jurisdiction over, or exercise governmental power within, any land located outside of the State in which that Indian tribe was principally located as of such enactment, until and unless land has been taken into trust on behalf of that Indian tribe.</summary>
