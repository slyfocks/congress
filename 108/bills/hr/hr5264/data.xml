  <summary>10/7/2004--Introduced.
Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address sustained petroleum product price increases in the United States that could have an adverse impact on the Nation's economy, regardless of whether there has been a supply interruption or shortage. Prohibits the Secretary from reducing the capacity of the SPR to less than 700 million barrels of petroleum product.</summary>
