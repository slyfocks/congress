    "text": "Requires automobile dealers to disclose to consumers the presence of Event Data Recorders (EDRs) on new automobiles at the time of purchase in a clear and conspicuous format that communicates: (1) the presence and location of the EDR; (2) the type of information recorded by the EDR and how such information is recorded; and (3) that information recorded by the EDR also may be used in law enforcement proceedings. Requires automobile manufacturers to include the same information in the owner's manual of any new automobile containing an EDR. Prohibits persons from manufacturing for sale, selling, offering for sale, introducing or delivering into interstate commerce, or importing automobiles manufactured after 2006 (and bearing a model year of 2007 or later) that are equipped with EDRs, unless those EDRs can be disabled by the consumer. Treats a violation of EDR requirements of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) and requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce this Act accordingly. Requires the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study and report to Congress on the potential utility and still unknown consequences of implementing EDR technology."
