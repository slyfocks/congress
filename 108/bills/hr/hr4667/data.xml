Tapoco Project Licensing Act of 2004 - (Sec. 1) Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to engage in a specified simultaneous land exchange with the Alcoa Power Generating Inc. (APGI). (Sec. 3) Identifies the land within the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to be conveyed by APGI. Identifies the land to be conveyed by the Secretary as: (1) adjacent to or flooded by the Chilhowee Reservoir; and (2) within the boundary of the Tapoco Hydroelectric Project as of February 21, 2003. Prescribes procedural requirements, including: (1) reservation of a conservation easement over any land conveyed to APGI; and (2) reversion of title to the United States if the Chilhowee Reservoir ceases to exist, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issues a final order decommissioning the Tapoco Project from which no further appeal may be taken. (Sec. 4) Grants FERC jurisdiction to license the Tapoco Project upon completion of the land exchange. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture to acquire for the United States any land or interest in land, including specified easements, that may be transferred by APGI to a nongovernmental organization pursuant to a specified Settlement Agreement. Sets forth boundary adjustment procedures. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to evaluate the feasibility of managing specified land acquired by the Secretary of Agriculture in a manner that retains the primitive, back-country character of the land. (Sec. 6) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
