  <summary>3/11/2003--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was reported in the House on February 22, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Do-Not-Call Implementation Act - Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate regulations establishing fees sufficient to implement and enforce provisions relating to the "do-not-call" registry of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (prohibits a telemarketer from calling an individual listed on a do-not-call registry) promulgated under the Telephone Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act. Allows such fees to be collected for FY 2003 through 2007. Provides that amounts collected as fees shall be available only to offset the costs of implementation and enforcement of the Rule and of resulting activities.Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: (1) issue a final rule pursuant to a rulemaking proceeding begun under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; and (2) coordinate with the FTC to maximize consistency with the FTC's "do-not-call" rule.Directs the FTC and FCC to submit to specified congressional committees: (1) a report including an analysis of the telemarketing rules promulgated by each commission, any inconsistencies between such rules, and proposals to remedy such inconsistencies; and (2) annual reports for FY 2003 through 2007 on the effectiveness, use, payment of access fees, and enforcement of the national do-not-call registry and on coordination of its operation with similar State registries.</summary>
