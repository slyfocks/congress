Improving Government Accountability Act of 2003 - Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to allow an Inspector General (IG) to be removed from office prior to the expiration of his term on the grounds of: (1) permanent disability; (2) inefficiency; (3) neglect of duty; (4) malfeasance; or (5) conviction of a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude. Establishes the term of office of each IG as seven years. Directs that any individual appointed to fill a vacancy in that position, occurring before the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed, be appointed for the remainder of that term. Authorizes an IG, for each fiscal year, to transmit an appropriation estimate and request to the Office of Management and Budget and to the appropriate congressional committees or subcommittees, in addition to the head of the establishment involved. Directs that each Government budget submitted by the President include a separate statement regarding amounts requested by IGs, including a comparison with the amounts requested by the head of the establishment involved. Establishes within the Executive Branch the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to increase the professionalism and effectiveness of personnel by developing policies, standards, and approaches to aid in the establishment of a well-trained and highly skilled workforce in the offices of the IG. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to maintain a personnel management system applicable to the officers and employees of IG offices. Prohibits reprisals because of comments on proposed regulations.</summary>
