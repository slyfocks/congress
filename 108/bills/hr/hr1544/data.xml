  <summary>4/1/2003--Introduced.
ATM Public Safety and Crime Control Act - Amends the Bank Protection Act of 1968 and the Federal Credit Union Act to direct each Federal banking supervisory agency and the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUAB), respectively, to require a depository institution to: (1) provide lighting and a surveillance camera of sufficient quality to produce surveillance pictures which can be used effectively as evidence in a criminal prosecution of illegal activities at the location monitored by the camera; and (2) operate such camera in a manner which does not compromise the quality of the surveillance pictures. Amends the Federal Judicial Code to instruct the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to: (1) periodically review the standards and procedures applicable to such surveillance and security requirements; and (2) make technical recommendations to the Federal banking agencies and the NCUAB on standards and procedures to implement this Act. Sets forth a timetable for the Federal banking agencies and the NCUAB to prescribe final regulations that require depository institutions and credit unions to achieve compliance with this Act.</summary>
