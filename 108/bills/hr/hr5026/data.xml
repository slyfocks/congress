  <summary>9/8/2004--Introduced.
Textiles and Apparel China Safeguard Act - Requires the President to modify the procedures for considering requests from the public for safeguard actions on imports of textiles and apparel products of the People's Republic of China (PRC), as published in the Federal Register on May 21, 2003, so that import relief will be provided, in accordance with the Accession Agreement of the PRC to the World Trade Organization (WTO), if a claim is supported by data showing that imports of textiles or apparel products of Chinese origin are threatening to impede the orderly development of trade in such products, including products not produced in the United States if such products include components of U.S. origin. Requires the President to: (1) initiate consultations with the PRC to reach an agreement on the application of quantitative limitations on U.S. imports of all PRC textiles and apparel products that are subject, as of September 1, 2004, to quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing of the WTO, and meet the requirements for applying safeguards on such imports; and (3) impose the quantitative limitations on such textiles and apparel products provided for in the Accession Agreement if, after consultations are inititated, an agreement is not reached.</summary>
