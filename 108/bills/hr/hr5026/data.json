Requires the President to: (1) initiate consultations with the PRC to reach an agreement on the application of quantitative limitations on U.S. imports of all PRC textiles and apparel products that are subject, as of September 1, 2004, to quotas under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing of the WTO, and meet the requirements for applying safeguards on such imports; and (3) impose the quantitative limitations on such textiles and apparel products provided for in the Accession Agreement if, after consultations are inititated, an agreement is not reached."
