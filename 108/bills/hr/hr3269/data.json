Directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit biannual reports: (1) describing actions by foreign governments to manipulate their currencies to increase their exports and to limit imports from the United States; (2) analyzing the impact of such currency manipulation on the U.S. manufacturing sector and on U.S. monetary policy; and (3) setting forth remedies against such currency manipulation. Directs the President to: (1) negotiate with any country identified by the Secretary of Commerce as engaging in currency manipulation to end such practice; and (2) seek compensation from such country (if in the national interest) for the damages incurred by U.S. manufacturers."
