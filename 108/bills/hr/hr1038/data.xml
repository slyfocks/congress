  <summary>9/15/2003--Reported to House amended, Part III.
Public Lands Fire Regulations Enforcement Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to increase above $1,000 the maximum fine for violations of public lands regulations to the fine as provided under current Federal criminal law with respect to lands under the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Amends the National Park Service Organic Act, and other Federal law concerning the National Forest System, to increase the maximum $500 fines to $10,000 for use and management violations with respect to national park and national forest lands. Amends such Acts to set a minimum fine of $500 for fire usage violations on BLM public lands, National Park System lands, or National Forest System lands if the violation was the result of reckless conduct, occurred in an area subject to a complete ban on open fires, and resulted in damage to public or private property.</summary>
