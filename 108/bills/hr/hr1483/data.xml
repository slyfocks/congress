  <summary>3/27/2003--Introduced.
Depleted Uranium Munitions Study Act of 2003 - Requires the Director of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct jointly and report to Congress on: (1) a comprehensive study of the health effects of exposure to depleted uranium munitions upon uranium-exposed veterans and upon their children born after such exposure; and (2) a public health assessment of persons who are thought to have an epidemiological link to any U.S. military installation or production facility at which depleted uranium munitions have either been, or currently are being used or produced. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct and report to certain congressional committees on a comprehensive environmental evaluation of possible contamination of the soil, air, water, and vegetation by depleted uranium at sites listed by the Secretary of Defense where depleted uranium munitions have been used or produced. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) develop and implement a plan for the mitigation and cleanup of depleted uranium at the pertinent sites; and (2) submit annual progress reports to the Administrator and such congressional committees.</summary>
