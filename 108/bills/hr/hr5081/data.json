    "text": "Requires the Secretary of each military department, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, to establish a program as prescribed in this Act to provide educational assistance to members of the Ready Reserve of the Armed Forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned. Makes eligible for such benefits on or after September 11, 2001, members of Reserve components who: (1) served on active duty in support of contingency operations for at least 90 consecutive days; or (2) in the case of an Army or Air National Guard member, performed full time duty for at least 90 consecutive days for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds. Creates an exception to the 90-day requirement for members released from duty because of injury, illness, or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty. States that members remain entitled to such educational assistance if ordered to active duty while serving in the Selected Reserve or the Ready Reserve. Terminates educational assistance for disabled members 10 years from the date of entitlement. Requires educational assistance under this Act to be provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs."
