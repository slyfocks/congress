Requires an LEA, as a condition for receiving such a grant, to agree to: (1) remove any vending machines that sell foods and beverages of minimal nutritional value from each elementary or secondary school where qualified vending machines will be placed using the grant funds; and (2) use only qualified vending machines in such school for a period prescribed by the Director. Limits maximum portion sizes of food and beverages offered for sale in qualified vending machines.</summary>
