  <summary>4/28/2004--Introduced.
Helping America Hear Act of 2004 - Requires each Federal health benefits plan to include coverage for the provision of at least two hearing aids every three years, except that this provision shall not be construed as requiring the payment under such plan in any three-year period of more than $2,000 on hearing aids with respect to any individual. Amends: (1) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to provide that if a group health plan provides benefits with respect to hospital and surgical expenses, the plan (and any health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with such a plan) shall provide coverage for the provision of at least two hearing aids every three years, except that this provision shall not be construed as requiring the payment under such plan in any three-year period of more than $2,000 on hearing aids with respect to any individual; and (2) the Public Health Service Act to make the above ERISA provision applicable to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in the individual market in the same manner as they apply to health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer in connection with a group health plan in the small or large group market.</summary>
