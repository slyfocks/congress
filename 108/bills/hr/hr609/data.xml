Terrorist Victim Citizenship Relief Act of 2003 - Deems aliens who died as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States to be honorary U.S. citizens if they held lawful immigration status. Entitles the spouses and children of such victims to status as permanent resident aliens, without regard to their current status, if they apply for permanent resident status within two years after enactment of this Act. Prohibits awarding honorary citizenship to any alien or granting permanent resident status to any family member of any alien who is inadmissible or deportable under the Immigration and Nationality Act, including any perpetrator of such attacks.</summary>
