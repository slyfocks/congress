Provides that if the Secretary is unable to verify that an article of food is from a registered foreign facility then such article shall be held at its point of entry and prohibited from being delivered to the appropriate importer, owner, or consignee until such foreign facility is registered. Modifies the content of the prior notice of imported food shipments."
