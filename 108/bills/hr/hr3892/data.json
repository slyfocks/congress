Limits such deduction for any taxable year to the lesser of $1,000,000 or the excess (if any) of $1,000,000 over the amount paid into the Reserve for all prior taxable years. Includes in taxpayer gross income any amount distributed from the Reserve and any penalties for self dealing or failure to distribute funds for Reserve purposes. Imposes a penalty of ten percent additional tax for any amount distributed from a Reserve that is not used exclusively to pay qualified hazardous waste costs."
