  <summary>7/25/2003--Introduced.
Chemical Facility Security Act of 2003 - Requires owners or operators of selected chemical storage facilities to develop and implement a site security plan that addresses the facility's vulnerability to a terrorist release. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations specifying: (1) which facilities should be selected based on the likelihood of terrorist attack, the nature of the substances stored, the potential harm if released, cost, and technical feasibility; (2) a timetable for the completion of a vulnerability assessment and site security plan; (3) the contents of the plan; (4) plan certification and availability requirements; and (5) limits on the disclosure of sensitive information. Requires the Secretary to provide owners or operators with relevant threat information to the extent practicable. Grants the Secretary access to the premises, security plans, and other records, as necessary, for any selected facility. Permits chemical sources required to prepare a facility vulnerability assessment and a facility security plan or an emergency response plan under other acts to be excluded from the requirements of this Act. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide the Secretary, upon request, with any vulnerability assessment or emergency response plan received by the Administrator under the terrorist and other intentional acts provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act.</summary>
