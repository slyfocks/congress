Authorizes the Secretary, upon the request of an accreditation body, to issue a limited provisional certificate for not more than 72 hours to an entity to conduct examinations for educational purposes during an on-site visit by an accreditation body. Requires the Secretary to appoint at least two industry representatives with expertise in mammography equipment to the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee. Provides that the Advisory Committee shall meet at least annually. (Current law requires biannual meetings.) Authorizes appropriations through FY 2007 for breast cancer screening surveillance research grants and for mammography facilities certification activities not supported by fees."
