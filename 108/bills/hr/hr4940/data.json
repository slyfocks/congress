    "text": "Municipal Solid Waste Responsibility Act of 2004 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit a landfill or incinerator (facility) from receiving out-of-State municipal solid waste unless the owner or operator of the facility obtains explicit authorization from the affected local government. Directs affected local governments, prior to taking formal action on a request for such authorization, to: (1) notify the Governor, contiguous local governments, and any contiguous Indian tribes; and (2) provide public notice and an opportunity for comment. Creates exceptions to the authorization requirement for owners or operators who held certain authorizations prior to enactment of this Act, where the facility received shipments of out-of-State municipal solid waste during 1993, or where the waste was generated within the bi-State metropolitan statistical area in which the facility is located. Authorizes States to: (1) limit the amount of out-of-State municipal solid waste received annually by facilities; (2) impose cost recovery surcharges on the combustion or disposal of such waste; and (3) enact laws imposing limitations on the receipt and disposal of foreign municipal solid waste. Prohibits persons from importing, transporting, or exporting municipal solid waste for final disposal or incineration in violation of the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct studies and develop recommendations concerning the benefits of alternatives to open field disposal of agricultural solid wastes (including biomass)."
