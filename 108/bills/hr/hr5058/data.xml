  <summary>9/9/2004--Introduced.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit an alien child of an alien parent classified as an immediate relative to be classified as an immediate relative for purposes of the exemption from direct numerical limitations on immigration if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, on the basis of a petition filed on the child's behalf, that: (1) the child is in the United States and is accompanied by the alien parent; (2) the child is receiving medical treatment unavailable outside the United States; and (3) such classification is necessary to avoid extreme hardship to the child or parent. Addresses petitioning procedures for such classification.</summary>
