  <summary>5/19/2004--Introduced.
Connecting the Operations of National Networks of Emergency Communications Technologies for First Responders Act of 2004 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to express the sense of Congress that: (1) Project SAFECOM (an e-government initiative) has made very limited progress toward achieving communications interoperability among government entities; (2) a lack of effective collaboration and consistent funding are impeding progress; and (3) all funding and program management to achieve interoperability should reside within the Department of Homeland Security. Establishes the Office of Wireless Public Safety Interoperable Communications within the Directorate of Science and Technology. Requires with regard to communications interoperability: (1) the Secretary, acting through the Director of such Office, to provide leadership, coordination, and technical assistance; (2) the Director, under the direction of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to conduct R&amp;D, evaluate new technologies, promote deployment of advanced broadband communications technologies, and encourage flexible and open architectures and standards; (3) the Secretary, acting through both the Director and the Office of State and Local Government Coordination, to conduct outreach and coordination; and (4) the Secretary, acting through the Director, to develop a national strategy. Creates an interoperable communications technology grant program for eligible States (those States lacking adequate interoperability that have submitted a communications interoperability plan to the Secretary) and local governments and public safety agencies within such States. Prohibits the award of grants to reimburse recipients for past expenditures except that public safety agencies may be reimbursed for funds expended after September 11, 2001, and before the date of enactment of this Act if such expenditures support an approved agency plan.</summary>
