    "text": "Amends the Bend Pine Nursery Land Conveyance Act to repeal the authorization for the sale or exchange of any or all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to Tract A (comprising approximately 210 acres) of the Bend Pine Nursery in Oregon. Rescinds the right of first refusal previously granted to the Bend Metro Park and Recreation District in Deschutes County, Oregon to purchase Tract A of the Bend Pine Nursery. Directs the Secretary, upon receipt of consideration in the amount of $3,505,676 from the Bend Metro Park and Recreation District, to convey all right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real property consisting of approximately 185 acres and containing the Bend Pine Nursery to such Recreation District. Requires that the real property conveyed to the Bend Metro Park and Recreation District under this Act be used for recreation purposes only and permits it to be developed for those purposes. Provides that, if the Secretary determines that the real property subject to this condition is converted, in whole or in part, to non-recreational use, the Secretary shall require the Bend Metro Park and Recreation District to pay to the United States an amount equal to the fair market value of such property at the time of conversion, less such consideration paid. Directs the Bend Metro Park and Recreation District, after receipt of the real property described above, to convey, without consideration, a parcel of real property located in the northwest corner of such property and consisting of approximately 15 acres to the Administrative School District No. 1, Deschutes County, Oregon. Instructs that the deed of such conveyance contain a covenant requiring that the real property conveyed to the School District be used for educational purposes only."
