Medicare Clinical Pharmacist Practitioner Services Coverage Act of 2004 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to provide for Medicare coverage of authorized clinical pharmacist practitioner (CPP) services involving toxicology, therapeutics, clinical pharmacokinetics, pharmacoeconomics, and other life sciences for the direct care of patients, which would otherwise be covered if furnished by a physician, or as an incident to a physician's professional service. Requires such services to be performed under State law or regulation in a collaborative practice agreement. Requires Medicare beneficiaries to pay 20 percent coinsurance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop, and report to Congress on, CPP fee schedules meeting specified requirements for services furnished by January 1, 2007. Requires CPP's to be reimbursed at 85 percent of applicable physicians' rates as of January 1, 2005, until such fee schedules are implemented.</summary>
