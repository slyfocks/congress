Requires such services to be performed under State law or regulation in a collaborative practice agreement. Requires Medicare beneficiaries to pay 20 percent coinsurance. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop, and report to Congress on, CPP fee schedules meeting specified requirements for services furnished by January 1, 2007. Requires CPP's to be reimbursed at 85 percent of applicable physicians' rates as of January 1, 2005, until such fee schedules are implemented."
