Prescribes implementation guidelines under which fifty percent of such royalties, together with interest earned from the date of payment, shall be paid by the Secretary of the Treasury to the payor of the royalties to be used solely for land reclamation purposes in accordance with a schedule to implement a reclamation plan for the lands. Conditions such payment upon the following: (1) receipt of the royalties by the Secretary of the Interior; (2) approval of the reclamation plan and schedule by the Secretary of the Interior; and (3) submittal of such approved schedule to the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on the effects of the royalty reduction, including a recommendation on whether the reduced royalty rate for potassium from sylvite should continue to apply after the end of the reporting period."
