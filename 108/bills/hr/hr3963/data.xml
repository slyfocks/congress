  <summary>3/11/2004--Introduced.
Congressional Accountability Enhancement Act of 2004 - Amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to prohibit discrimination in access to and use of congressional electronic and information technology by Federal and non-Federal individuals with disabilities. Amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to apply such prohibition to the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Government Printing Office, and the Library of Congress. Grants covered employees and applicants for such employment rights and protections under Whistleblower Protection Rules. Includes: (1) GAO employees and Library of Congress employees as covered employees; and (2) GAO and the Library of Congress as employing offices. Prohibits an employing office from: (1) discharging a covered employee by reason of a garnishment of such individual's earnings for any one indebtedness; or (2) denying employment to, terminating the employment of, or discriminating with respect to employment against a covered employee who has been a debtor or bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act, or discriminating against another covered employee with whom such bankrupt or debtor has been associated, solely because of debtor or insolvent status. Prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation of legislative branch entities. Covers legislative branch employees under the Federal Judicial Code rules protecting jurors' employment. Applies administrative and judicial dispute-resolution procedures of the Act for violations of certain rights and protections under: (1) the Employee Polograph Protection Act of 1988; (2) the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act; and (3) Federal law regarding veterans' employment and reemployment. Directs the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance to study and report to Congress on the feasibility and desirability of extending all procedural rules and enforcement mechanisms under the Act to all legislative branch entities. Requires employing offices to post notices of rights and protections applicable to covered employees under the Act and any other Federal law relating to the terms and conditions of employment or access to public services and accommodations.</summary>
