Requires all acquisitions of land or waters under this Act to: (1) be made in a voluntary manner; and (2) not be the result of forced takings. Provides that, in addition to the purposes of the Refuge under other laws regulations, Executive orders, and comprehensive conservation plans, the Refuge shall be managed for: (1) the protection and recovery of endangered Hawaiian water birds and other endangered birds, including the Nene (Hawaiian goose); and (2) the conservation and management of native coastal strand, riparian, and aquatic biological diversity. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be considered to affect certain policies or requirements under the National Wildlife Refuge Administration Act of 1966 to treat compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses as priority general public uses of the Refuge. Allows the Secretary, in the administration of the Refuge, to use such additional statutory authority available to the Secretary for the conservation of fish and wildlife and the provision of opportunities for fish- and wildlife-dependent recreation to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
