Modifies provisions regarding distributing or manufacturing drugs in or near schools to delete the \"100 feet\" limitation, to include public libraries and daycare facilities, and to increase imprisonment terms. Increases or expands the scope of penalties regarding employing children to distribute drugs near schools and playgrounds, employing persons under age 18 in drug distribution, and distributing drugs to underage persons. Directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to: (1) increase base offense levels for drug-related offenses involving minors; and (2) provide for specified sentencing enhancements for persons possessing or brandishing a firearm. Prohibits distributing or manufacturing a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a drug treatment facility. Modifies: (1) Federal criminal code provisions regarding the sentencing of a defendant who substantially assists the Government in an investigation and prosecution, and regarding detention prior to sentencing; and (2) the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding the acceptance or rejection of plea agreements. Amends the CSA to: (1) increase penalties for, and expand the scope of provisions regarding, endangering human life while illegally manufacturing a controlled substance; and (2) provide for life imprisonment without release for drug felons and violent criminals convicted a third time."
