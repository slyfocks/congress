Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act - (Sec. 3) Authorizes the appropriate Secretary (the Secretary of the Interior with respect to a Federal land management agency other than the Forest Service or the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to the Forest Service), beginning on January 1, 2005, to establish, modify, charge, and collect recreation fees at Federal recreational lands and waters as provided for in this section. Specifies requirements for recreation fees, entrance fees, standard amenity recreation fees, expanded amenity recreation fees, and special recreation permit fees. (Sec. 4) Sets forth provisions for public participation in the development or changing of recreation fees established under this Act. Requires the appropriate Secretary to provide: (1) notice of the establishment of a new recreation fee area for each agency six months before establishment; and (2) advance notice of a new recreation fee or change to an existing recreation fee established under this Act. Directs the appropriate Secretary to establish a Recreation Resource Advisory Committee in each State or region for the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management to advise the Secretary regarding the establishment of a standard amenity recreation fee or expanded amenity recreation fee. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretaries to: (1) establish, and authorize charging a fee for, America the Beautiful-the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Passes which shall cover the entrance fee and standard amenity recreation fee for all Federal recreational lands and waters for which an entrance fee or a standard amenity recreation fee is charged; (2) hold annual competitions to select the image on the Pass; (3) establish the price of the Pass; and (4) market the Pass. Allows such Secretaries to enter into cooperative agreements with governmental and nongovernmental entities for the development and implementation of the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass Program.
