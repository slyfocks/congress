  <summary>7/22/2004--Introduced.
Aviation Biometric Technology Utilization Act - Amends Federal transportation law to change from discretionary to mandatory the authority of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to issue guidance for the use of biometrics or other technology that positively verifies the identity of each airport employee and law enforcement officer who enters a secure area of an airport. Prescribes minimum requirements for such guidance. Directs the Under Secretary to establish: (1) a law enforcement officer travel credential that incorporates biometrics and is uniform across all Federal, State, and local government law enforcement agencies; (2) a process by which the travel credential will be used to verify the identity of a Federal, State, or local government law enforcement officer seeking to carry a weapon on board an aircraft, without unnecessarily disclosing to the public that the individual is a law enforcement officer; and (3) related procedures. Requires the Under Secretary to begin issuance of the travel credential to each Federal, State, and local government law enforcement officer authorized to carry a weapon on board an aircraft.</summary>
