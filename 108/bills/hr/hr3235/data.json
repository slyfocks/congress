Directs the Secretary to waive application of this Act to a State if the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the State's noncompliance does not pose a security risk to the United States. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the period of availability of withheld funds; (2) the apportionment of withheld funds after compliance; and (3) the availability of lapsed funds to the Secretary of Homeland Security for programs and activities to secure the borders of the United States and to enhance immigration enforcement activities."
