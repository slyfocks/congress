Requires such a system to be one under which the State shares with the Federal Government information (including for non-criminal justice purposes) on each arrest, charge, or conviction (including any no contest plea) in such State for specified covered offenses. Requires such information to include the identity of: (1) each individual so arrested, charged, or convicted; and (2) the identity of each individual under suspicion for such an offense.
