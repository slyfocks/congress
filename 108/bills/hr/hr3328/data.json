Provides temporary relief from enforcement by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of drinking water standards for such systems during and after the grant application process. Delays implementation or enforcement by the Administrator of an arsenic standard in any State until the earlier of January 1, 2006, or the date on which the Administrator certifies that the program has been implemented in that State and the State has made substantial progress in drinking water standards compliance."
