Restores to the Reservation all right, title, and interest of the United States to those lands within such boundaries that were excluded from the Reservation pursuant to Executive Order No. 2273 (November 22, 1915), which shall be held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Colorado River Indian Tribes. (Excludes from such restored lands specified lands under title to the Arizona State Lands Department.) Subjects the restored lands to all existing rights-of-way, easements, leases, and mining claims. Declares that the United States reserves the right to continue all Reclamation projects, including the right to access and remove mineral materials for Colorado River maintenance on the restored lands. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to grant additional rights-of-way, expansions, or renewals of existing rights-of-way for roads, utilities, and other accommodations to adjoining landowners or existing right-of-way holders, if certain criteria are met. Prohibits gaming on lands taken into trust under this Act."
