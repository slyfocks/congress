  <summary>1/27/2003--Introduced.
Tribal College or University Teacher Loan Forgiveness Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide for the cancellation of a specified percentage of the total amount of any Federal Perkins loan, Federal Family Education loan, or direct student loan for each year of employment (up to five) as a full-time teacher at a tribal college or university if the borrower is not in default on such loan. Prohibits a borrower from receiving, for the same service, such a benefit and a national service educational award. Provides that the amount of any loan forgiven under this Act shall not be treated as gross income for Federal tax purposes.</summary>
