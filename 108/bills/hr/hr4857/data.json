Makes the Chief Information Officers of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and DHS responsible for coordinating such integration. Requires: (1) IDENT to be updated on a daily basis with information pertaining to warrants issued and individuals wanted for questioning by the FBI until IAFIS and IDENT have been fully integrated; (2) the Secretary to develop a clear and uniform policy that details when a border patrol agent shall use IAFIS and IDENT; and (3) a border patrol agent who uses IAFIS or IDENT with respect to an alien to update both systems with information pertaining to the agent's encounter with the alien."
