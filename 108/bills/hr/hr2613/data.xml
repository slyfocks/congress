  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
Public Access to Science Act - Amends Federal copyright law to declare copyright protection unavailable to any work produced pursuant to scientific research substantially funded by the Federal Government to the extent provided in the funding agreement entered into by the relevant Federal agency pursuant to this Act. Requires any Federal department or agency that enters into a funding agreement with any person for the performance of scientific research substantially funded by the Federal Government to include in the agreement a statement that copyright protection is not available for any work produced pursuant to such research under the agreement. Expresses the sense of Congress that any Federal department or agency that enters into such funding agreements should make every effort to develop and support mechanisms for making the published results of the research conducted pursuant to the agreements freely and easily available to the scientific community, the private sector, physicians, and the public.</summary>
