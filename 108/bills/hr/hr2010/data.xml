  <summary>10/30/2004--Public Law.
Amends Federal law to require a plurality (currently, a majority) of votes in elections for the Delegate representing American Samoa in the United States House of Representatives. Eliminates the requirement for runoff elections. Declares that the legislature of American Samoa may, but is not required to, provide for primary elections for the election of Delegate. Authorizes the legislature of American Samoa, if it provides for primary elections for the election of the Delegate, also to provide that the Delegate shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast in any general election for the office of Delegate for which such primary elections were held.</summary>
