  <summary>11/21/2003--Introduced.
Medicare Chronic Kidney Disease Management Act of 2003 - Entitles qualified chronic kidney disease patients to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act. Prohibits enrollment of chronic kidney disease patients in part C (Medicare+Choice) of the Social Security Act. Provides for pre-end stage renal disease (pre-ESRD) professional nutritional and other counseling and related services and items for individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish demonstration projects to evaluate methods through which kidney patient peer education may: (1) slow down or prevent the progress of kidney disease to end-stage renal disease in Medicare beneficiaries; (2) improve the management of co-morbid conditions associated with kidney disease; (3) improve choice in selection of renal replacement therapies (including home dialysis); and (4) improve other outcomes (such as employment).</summary>
