Provides that the program shall support individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams of investigators through competitive, merit-reviewed grants.Establishes as the program goal developing technologies and methods, based on the biological functions of microbes and plants, that: (1) can facilitate the production of fuels; (2) convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon; and (3) detoxify soils and water at DOE facilities contaminated with heavy metals and radiological materials. Requires the Secretary to: (1) transmit to Congress a research plan describing how the program will accomplish that goal; (2) contract with the National Academy of Sciences to review the plan; and (3) transmit the review to Congress along with the Secretary's response to recommendations.Prohibits the Secretary from conducting biomedical research in carrying out such program."
