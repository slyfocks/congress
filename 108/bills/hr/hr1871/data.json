Requires funds from such grants to be used for: (1) development of policies to expand opportunities for community or technical college students to earn bachelor's degrees, including promoting the transfer of academic credits between institutions and expanding articulation and guaranteed transfer agreements; (2) support services to students participating in the program, including tutoring, mentoring, academic and personal counseling, and transition facilitation; (3) need-based scholarships to transfer students for their third and fourth years of undergraduate education; (4) academic program enhancements at the community or technical college that increase program quality and the number of student participants in the dual degree program offered in conjunction with a baccalaureate degree granting institution; and (5) programs to identify barriers that inhibit student transfers."
