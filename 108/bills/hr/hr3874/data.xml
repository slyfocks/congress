Provides that if the Villages or any subsequent owner of the land transferred under this Act uses that land for purposes other than those specified above, all right, title, and interest to such land (and any improvements thereon) shall revert to the United States to be administered by the Bureau of Land Management, if the Secretary determines that such a reversion is in the best interests of the United States.</summary>
