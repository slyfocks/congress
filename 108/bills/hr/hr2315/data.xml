  <summary>6/3/2003--Introduced.
Badge Security Enhancement Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) eliminate as a defense to a prosecution for violating prohibitions against transporting, transferring, or possessing a police badge the intention that such a badge is to be used for decorative or recreational purposes; and (2) provide that prohibitions shall not apply to the use of a badge in the fictitious or historical visual depiction of either a public officer or employee. Requires a person to: (1) provide certification of the intended use of a genuine or counterfeit badge in order to receive one in interstate or foreign commerce; and (2) obtain written permission from the agency represented on the badge before knowingly transferring or transporting one in interstate or foreign commerce. Directs the Attorney General to establish additional procedures for the transfer or transportation of genuine and counterfeit police badges to assure that a badge is not acquired under false pretenses to be used for illegal purposes.</summary>
