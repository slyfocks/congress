  <summary>4/22/2004--Introduced.
Executive Stock Option Profit Recapture Act - Amends the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prescribe rules declaring that, if, at the end of a period ending one year after one or more of the five most highly compensated executive officers or the directors of an issuer have exercised options on the issuer's securities granted as compensation, the issuer's stock has declined by a material amount, then such executive officer or director shall be required to reimburse the issuer for all gains realized on the sale of securities obtained as a result of the option exercise that are in excess of any gains that would have been realized had the securities been sold at the stock price at the end of such one-year period.</summary>
