States as criteria for the selection of Indian land that, among other things, the bordering or adjacent Federal land: (1) pose a fire, disease, or other threat to Indian land or a tribal community, or be in need of land restoration activities; and (2) present or involve a feature or circumstance unique to the particular tribe (including treaty rights or biological, archaeological, historical, or cultural circumstances). Authorizes the appropriate Secretary to enter into such an agreement or contract following completion of any necessary environmental analysis. Specifies proposal evaluation and determination factors. Requires, within four years after enactment of this Act, the Secretary to report to Congress on the Indian tribal requests received and agreements or contracts that have been entered into."
