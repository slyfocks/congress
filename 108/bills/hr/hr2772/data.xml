  <summary>7/17/2003--Introduced.
John Rishel Geothermal Steam Act Amendments of 2003 - Amends the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to replace requirements governing bids and competitive bids with leasing procedures under which the Secretary of the Interior shall: (1) accept nominations at any time from qualified companies and individuals; (2) hold biennial competitive lease sales for lands located in areas for which such nominations are pending; and (3) make available for noncompetitive leasing for a two-year period any lands for which a competitive lease sale is held, but for which no competitive lease sale bids have been received. Cites circumstances under which lands leased exclusively for qualified development and direct utilization of geothermal resources shall be leased to the first qualified applicant. Permits existing lessees to convert previous leases to reflect the revisions of this Act. Reduces lease royalty percentages accruing from electricity produced using geothermal steam and associated geothermal resources. Mandates that 100 percent of such royalties received by the United States be paid at the rate of 75 percent to the host States and 25 percent to the pertinent county. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse certain persons for the costs of project-level analysis, documentation, or related study required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Requires an update of the 1978 Assessment of Geothermal Resources. Modifies guidelines governing: (1) cooperative or unit plans of development or operation of geothermal fields; and (2) royalties on byproducts. Repeals authorities of the Secretary to readjust terms, conditions, rentals, and royalties. Credits certain annual rentals towards royalty payments. Revamps lease terms and work commitment requirements. States that all public lands under the jurisdiction of a Secretary of a military department shall be open to the operation of the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and related laws and development and utilization of geothermal resources without the necessity for further action by the Secretary or Congress.</summary>
