Prohibits any Federal banking agency from agreeing to any proposed recommendation of the Basel Committee before the agency reports on it to the Congress. Requires such agencies, before reporting to Congress with respect to the New Basel Capital Accord, as revised through the Third Consultative Paper published on April 29, 2003, or any subsequent revisions or final agreement, to evaluate its impact, taking specified factors into account."
