    "text": "Medicare Regulatory and Contracting Reform Act of 2003 - Title I: Regulatory Reform - (Sec. 101) Amends part D (Miscellaneous) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to state that a provision in a final regulation that is not a logical outgrowth of a previously published notice of proposed rulemaking or interim final rule: (1) shall be treated as a proposed regulation; and (2) shall not take effect until there is the further opportunity for public comment and a publication of the provision again as a final regulation. Prohibits retroactive application to items or services of a substantive change in regulations, manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, or general guidelines unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that retroactive application is necessary to comply with statutory requirements or failure to apply the change retroactively would be contrary to the public interest.Provides that a substantive change shall not become effective before 30 days after the change is issued or published unless the Secretary finds that waiver of such 30-day period is necessary to comply with statutory requirements or if the application of such 30-day period is contrary to the public interest.States that a service provider or a supplier who reasonably relied on erroneous guidance shall not be subject to any sanction or penalty, provided certain conditions are met.(Sec. 103) Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to Congress on the feasibility and appropriateness of establishing in the Secretary authority to provide legally binding advisory opinions on appropriate interpretation and application of regulations to carry out the Medicare program.Amends SSA title VIII to direct the Secretary to report biennially to Congress on the administration of Medicare and areas of inconsistency or conflict among the various provisions under law and regulation.Title II: Contracting Reform - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title XVIII to revise and consolidate current law for the administration of the Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) programs into a structure similar to that provided for Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) contractors.Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with any eligible entity to serve as a Medicare administrative contractor in lieu of using provider-nominated fiscal intermediaries and carriers.

Allows a group health plan to require a Medicare claims determination in cases involving or appearing to involve inpatient dental hospital services or dental services expressly covered under Medicare pursuant to actions taken by the Secretary.(Sec. 511) Directs the Secretary to furnish to disproportionate share hospitals the data necessary for such hospitals to compute the number of Medicaid patient days percentage used in computing the disproportionate patient percentage for that hospital. Requires such data to be furnished also to other hospitals which would qualify for additional payments under Medicare part A on the basis of such data.(Sec. 512) Allows entities (such as physician staffing companies) to enroll in Medicare and to submit bills for services provided by a physician or other person when the entity has an arrangement with the physician or other person that includes joint and several liability for overpayment, and meets other program integrity safeguards as the Secretary determines appropriate.(Sec. 513) Amends Medicare part C (Medicare+Choice) to allow specialized Medicare+Choice plans for special needs beneficiaries to be any type of coordinated care plan.
