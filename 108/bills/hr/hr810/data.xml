  <summary date="2003-04-11" status="Reported to House amended, Part I.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(There is 1 &lt;a href=&quot;/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:HR00810:@@@D&amp;summ1&amp;&quot;&gt;other summary&lt;/a&gt;)">Medicare Regulatory and Contracting Reform Act of 2003 - Title I: Regulatory Reform - (Sec. 101) Amends part D (Miscellaneous) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to state that a provision in a final regulation that is not a logical outgrowth of a previously published notice of proposed rulemaking or interim final rule: (1) shall be treated as a proposed regulation; and (2) shall not take effect until there is the further opportunity for public comment and a publication of the provision again as a final regulation. Prohibits retroactive application to items or services of a substantive change in regulations, manual instructions, interpretive rules, statements of policy, or general guidelines unless the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that retroactive application is necessary to comply with statutory requirements or failure to apply the change retroactively would be contrary to the public interest.Provides that a substantive change shall not become effective before 30 days after the change is issued or published unless the Secretary finds that waiver of such 30-day period is necessary to comply with statutory requirements or if the application of such 30-day period is contrary to the public interest.States that a service provider or a supplier who reasonably relied on erroneous guidance shall not be subject to any sanction or penalty, provided certain conditions are met.(Sec. 103) Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to Congress on the feasibility and appropriateness of establishing in the Secretary authority to provide legally binding advisory opinions on appropriate interpretation and application of regulations to carry out the Medicare program.Amends SSA title VIII to direct the Secretary to report biennially to Congress on the administration of Medicare and areas of inconsistency or conflict among the various provisions under law and regulation.Title II: Contracting Reform - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title XVIII to revise and consolidate current law for the administration of the Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) and B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) programs into a structure similar to that provided for Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) contractors.Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with any eligible entity to serve as a Medicare administrative contractor in lieu of using provider-nominated fiscal intermediaries and carriers. Requires the Secretary to use competitive procedures in awarding five-year contracts. Allows the Secretary to contract separately for all or parts of the contractor functions, as well as an expanded range of entities, in order to select the most efficient and effective contractor. Authorizes continuation of MIP functions under current contracts and agreements and under rollover contracts.(Sec. 202) Requires each Medicare administrative contractor to implement a contractor-wide program to provide information security for its operation and assets. Requires annual independent audits to test the effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices of contractor information systems. Applies audit requirements to fiscal intermediaries and carriers before the transition to Medicare administrative contractors becomes effective.Title III: Education and Outreach - (Sec. 301) Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate the educational activities provided through Medicare contractors in order to maximize the effectiveness of Federal education efforts for service providers and suppliers; (2) use specific claims payment error rates or a similar methodology of Medicare administrative contractors in the processing or reviewing of Medicare claims in order to give contractors an incentive to implement effective education and outreach programs for service providers and suppliers; and (3) develop a strategy for communications with individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare part A or enrolled under Medicare part B, or both, and with service providers and suppliers.Prescribes requirements for Medicare administrative contractor responses to written inquiries of service providers, suppliers, and beneficiaries, including monitoring of such responses.Directs the Secretary to ensure that each Medicare administrative contractor provides a toll-free telephone number at which Medicare claimants, service providers, and suppliers may obtain pertinent information.Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary to increase the conduct by Medicare contractors of education and training of service providers and suppliers regarding billing, coding, and other appropriate items and to improve the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of contractor responses.Directs the Secretary and each Medicare contractor insofar as it provides services for service providers or suppliers to maintain an Internet site which: (1) provides answers in an easily accessible format to frequently asked questions; and (2) includes other published materials of the contractor that relate to service providers and suppliers.(Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to establish a demonstration program of technical assistance to small service providers or suppliers, upon request and on a voluntary basis, in order to improve compliance with applicable Medicare requirements.(Sec. 303) Amends SSA title XVIII to direct the Secretary to appoint within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) a Medicare Provider Ombudsman to: (1) provide assistance, on a confidential basis, to service providers and suppliers with respect to complaints, grievances, requests for information, the resolution of unclear or conflicting guidance from the Secretary and Medicare contractors to such service providers and suppliers; and (2) submit recommendations to the Secretary for improvement in the administration of Medicare.Requires the Secretary also to appoint a Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman to: (1) receive complaints, grievances, and requests for information from beneficiaries with respect to any aspect of the Medicare program; and (2) provide assistance with respect to such complaints, grievances, and requests.Requires the Secretary to provide, through the toll-free number 1-800-Medicare, a means by which individuals seeking information about, or assistance with, Medicare programs who phone such number are transferred to appropriate entities for the provision of such information or assistance. Requires this number to be the one listed for general information and assistance in the annual notice explaining Medicare benefits and limitations to coverage that is mailed to beneficiaries.(Sec. 304) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a demonstration program under which Medicare specialists employed by HHS provide advice and assistance to beneficiaries at the location of existing local offices of the Social Security Administration; (2) provide that Medicare beneficiary notices about post-hospital extended care services include information on the number of days of coverage remaining for the beneficiary and spell of illness involved; and (3) provide public information that enables hospital discharge planners, Medicare beneficiaries, and the public to identify skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program.(Sec. 306) Amends SSA title XVIII to require hospital discharge plans to identify, for individuals who are likely to need post-hospital extended care services, the availability of participating facilities that serve the area in which the patient resides.Title IV: Appeals and Recovery - (Sec. 401) Requires the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary, by October 1, 2004, to develop (and transmit to Congress and the Comptroller General for evaluation) a plan under which the functions of administrative law judges responsible for hearing Medicare and related cases are transferred from the responsibility of the Commissioner and the Social Security Administration to the Secretary and HHS. Directs the Commissioner and the Secretary to implement the transition plan and transfer the administrative law judge functions from the Social Security Administration to the Secretary between July 1, 2005, and October 1, 2005.Directs the Secretary to: (1) assure the independence of administrative law judges performing the administrative law judge functions transferred above from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and their contractors; and (2) provide for an appropriate geographic distribution of administrative law judges performing the transferred functions throughout the United States to ensure timely access to such judges.Authorizes additional appropriations to the Secretary to: (1) increase the number of administrative law judges and their staffs; (2) improve their education and training opportunities; and (3) increase the staff of the Departmental Appeals Board.(Sec. 402) Amends SSA title XVIII, as amended by the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA), to direct the Secretary to establish a process for expedited access to judicial review for a service provider, supplier, or beneficiary who has filed a Medicare appeal to obtain such access when a review panel determines that no entity in the administrative appeals process has the authority to decide the relevant question of law or regulation and no material issue of fact is in dispute.Provides that an agency or institution dissatisfied with a determination by the Secretary that it is not a service provider, or that it can no longer be a provider, shall have expedited access to judicial review, if it has filed for a hearing, in the same manner as provided for a provider, supplier, or beneficiary.Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a process to expedite administrative appeals of provider agreement determinations in which participation is terminated or other sanctions against skilled nursing facilities applied on an immediate basis have been imposed. Gives priority under such process to cases of termination of provider agreements.Authorizes increased appropriations from the Medicare trust funds to the Secretary for FY 2005 and each subsequent year to: (1) reduce by 50 percent the average time for administrative determinations on provider participation appeals; (2) increase the number of administrative law judges and their staffs and the appellate level staff at the Departmental Appeals Board of HHS; and (3) educate such judges and staffs on long-term care issues.Directs the Secretary to develop and implement, for facilities certified to have remedied deficiencies, a process for reinstatement of approval of a nurse aide training program of a skilled nursing facility before the end of the mandatory two-year suspension period, if the only basis for mandatory disapproval was assessment of a civil monetary penalty of at least $5,000.(Sec. 403) Amends SSA title XVIII, as amended by BIPA, to revise the Medicare appeals process, requiring full and early presentation of evidence by providers, and revise requirements for use of patients' medical records, Medicare appeals notices, and the qualifications of independent determination reviewers.(Sec. 404) Authorizes a Medicare administrative contractor to conduct a random prepayment review only to develop contractor-wide or program-wide claims payment error rates or under such additional circumstances as may be provided under regulations, developed in consultation with service providers and suppliers. Establishes limitations on non-random prepayment review.(Sec. 405) Provides that, if the repayment by a service provider or supplier of an overpayment within 30 days would constitute a hardship, upon request the Secretary shall enter into a plan with the provider or supplier for the repayment (through offset or otherwise) over a period of between six months and three years (five years for extreme hardship). Requires interest to accrue on the balance through the period of repayment.(Sec. 406) Directs the Secretary to establish by regulation: (1) a process for the enrollment of service providers and suppliers; and (2) procedures with deadlines for actions on applications for enrollment (or renewal of enrollment). Requires the Secretary to: (1) monitor the performance of Medicare administrative contractors in meeting such deadlines; and (2) consult with service providers and suppliers before making changes in the provider enrollment forms. Allows a service provider or a supplier whose application to enroll (or renew enrollment) is denied to have a hearing and judicial review of such denial.(Sec. 407) Directs the Secretary to develop a process whereby, in the case of minor errors or omissions detected in the submission of Medicare claims, a service provider or supplier is given an opportunity to correct such an error or omission and resubmit the claim without the need to initiate an appeal.Amends SSA title XVIII to permit the use of corrected and supplementary data, including permitting submittal and resubmittal of applications for changes involving applications of certain hospitals requesting that the Secretary change the hospital's geographic classification.(Sec. 408) Directs the Secretary to establish a process: (1) under which physicians and beneficiaries may obtain determination of whether Medicare covers certain items and services before they are provided; and (2) for the collection of information on instances in which an advance beneficiary notice has been provided before items or services are furnished when a service provider believes that payment will not be made, and on instances in which a beneficiary indicates on such notice that he or she does not intend to seek to have the item or service furnished. Requires the Secretary to establish a program of outreach and education for beneficiaries, service providers, and other persons on the appropriate use of advance beneficiary notices and Medicare coverage policies.
