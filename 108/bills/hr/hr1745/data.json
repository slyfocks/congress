Directs the National Transportation Safety Board to study and report to Congress on: (1) the number of States that have adopted laws to impound the motor vehicles of individuals charged with DWI; (2) the number and severity of traffic accidents caused by individuals who were released by State and local police hours after being charged with DWI; and (3) the need for States to enact vehicle impoundment laws for those charged with DWI, and the effectiveness of such laws in States which have already enacted them."
