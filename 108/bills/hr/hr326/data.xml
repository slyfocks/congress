Classifies any shareholder credit determined under this Act as a tax paid by the relevant corporation.Includes a taxpayer's shareholder credits in gross income.Permits a corporation to deduct 100 percent of the amount received as dividends from a domestic corporation (presently the Code allows a deduction of 70 percent or 100 percent, depending on the type of dividend).
