Includes in the reimbursement to producers of watches in the insular possessions, the difference between the amount that would have been due on a producer's non-digital watches during the preceding year under duty rates existing on January 1, 2001, and the amount due under the actual duty rates of that preceding calendar year. Increases the unit per producer limit for jewelry products of the insular possessions, while retaining the overall unit and dollar value limits for the PIC program. Revises certain requirements for duty-free treatment of articles of jewelry as products of the insular possessions. Requires treatment as such a product if the article of jewelry is: (1) assembled in an insular possession by a jewelry manufacturer or jewelry assembler that commenced manufacturing or assembly in such territory after August 9, 2001; and (2) entered into the United States within 18 months after the manufacturer or assembler commenced operations.

Authorizes a drawback to be claimed by designating any entry of such merchandise that was imported within one year before its exportation or destruction. Prohibits the allowance of a drawback unless the completed article is exported or destroyed under the supervision of the Customs Service within five years after its importation. Sets forth drawback requirements with regard to: (1) use of domestic merchandise acquired in exchange for imported merchandise of same kind and quality; (2) packaging material; and (3) liquidation of entries.

(Sec. 3602) Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the cellar treatment of domestic and imported natural wine. (Sec. 3603) States that, with respect to certain currently excluded non-import-sensitive articles (handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather wearing apparel) imported into the United States from Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) beneficiary countries (Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru), the entry of any such article on or after August 6, 2002, and before the date that the President proclaims duty-free treatment for such article, shall be subject to the rate of duty applicable on August 5, 2002. Requires the liquidation or reliquidation of such entries as if the reduced duty preferential treatment applied. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to refund any excess duties paid. Prescribes requirements for request of such liquidation or reliquidation. (Sec. 3604) Amends the Trade Act of 2002 to revise certain reporting requirements to direct the Comptroller General to study and report to specified congressional committees on the extent to which the amount of certain imposed customs user fees approximates (currently, is commensurate with) the cost of services provided by the Customs Service. Amends the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) to revise certain requirements with respect to the duty-free treatment of certain apparel articles that are imported into the United States from CBTPA or sub-Saharan African beneficiary countries. Amends the Andean Trade Preference Act with respect to U.S. vessels whose harvested tuna (prepared or preserved in a certain way in an Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) beneficiary country) may enter the United States free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions. Treats as a U.S. vessel, in addition to those with fishery endorsements on their certificates of documentation, any vessel without a fishery endorsement which is documented under U.S. laws and licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988. Directs the Customs Service to liquidate or reliquidate as free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions, limitations, or consultation levels certain entries of apparel articles made on or after October 1, 2000, which meet certain CBERA or AGOA requirements. Amends the Textile Products Identification Act to prescribe marking requirements for certain imported socks. Chapter 2: Technical Amendments Relating to Entry and Protest - (Sec. 3701) Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to state that entries filed as required by an importer of record shall not be liquidated if covered by an import activity summary (IAS) statement. Subjects to liquidation or reliquidation, however, each reconfigured entry of merchandise in such a statement. Increases from 15 months to 21 months after an importer declares his intent to file it the deadlines for filing a reconciliation with regard to identified entry elements. (Sec. 3702) Declares that a reconfigured entry, filed under an IAS statement, which is not liquidated within one year from the date such statement is filed or should have been filed, whichever is earlier, shall be deemed liquidated at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duties asserted at the time of entry by the importer of record. (Sec. 3703) Revises requirements for protests of final decisions of the Customs Service. Increases the period of time within which a protest must be filed from 90 to 180 days after (but not before) the date (currently, notice) of liquidation or reliquidation, or, in the case of a surety with an unsatisfied legal claim under its bond, from the date of mailing of notice of demand for payment against the bond. (Sec. 3704) Repeals the 90 day deadline for the filing of a request for an accelerated disposition of a protest. (Sec. 3705) Repeals the authority of the Customs Service, even though a valid protest has not been not filed, to reliquidate an entry or reconciliation to correct: (1) a clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence, whether or not resulting from or contained in electronic transmission, not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, adverse to the importer and manifest from the record or established by documentary evidence, in any entry, liquidation, or other customs transaction, when the error, mistake, or inadvertence is brought to the attention of the Customs Service within one year after the date of liquidation or exaction; or (2) any assessment of duty on household or personal effects in respect of which an application for refund has been filed, with such employee as the Secretary of the Treasury shall designate, within one year after the date of entry. (Sec. 3706) Defines reconfigured entry as one filed on an IAS statement which substitutes for all or part of one or more entries filed with the Customs Service or filed on a reconciliation entry that aggregates the entry elements to be reconciled for purposes of liquidation, reliquidation, or protest. Chapter 3: Protection of Intellectual Property Rights - (Sec. 3751) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to require the U.S. Trade Representative to make specified determinations about U.S. rights within 30 days after a dispute settlement procedure is concluded if the USTR considers that U.S. rights are involved under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) or the GATT 1994 relating to products subject to intellectual property protection.</summary>
