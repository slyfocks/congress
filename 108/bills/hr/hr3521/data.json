Includes in the reimbursement to producers of watches in the insular possessions, the difference between the amount that would have been due on a producer's non-digital watches during the preceding year under duty rates existing on January 1, 2001, and the amount due under the actual duty rates of that preceding calendar year.

Amends the Andean Trade Preference Act with respect to U.S. vessels whose harvested tuna (prepared or preserved in a certain way in an Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA) beneficiary country) may enter the United States free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions. Treats as a U.S. vessel, in addition to those with fishery endorsements on their certificates of documentation, any vessel without a fishery endorsement which is documented under U.S. laws and licensed under the South Pacific Tuna Act of 1988. Directs the Customs Service to liquidate or reliquidate as free of duty and free of any quantitative restrictions, limitations, or consultation levels certain entries of apparel articles made on or after October 1, 2000, which meet certain CBERA or AGOA requirements.
