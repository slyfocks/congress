Children's Listbroker Privacy Act - Makes it unlawful: (1) to sell personal information about an individual the seller knows to be a child (under age 16); (2) to purchase personal information about an individual identified by the seller as a child for the purpose of marketing to that child; or (3) for a purchaser who has provided a certification limiting the use of such information to engage in any practice that violates the certification terms. Makes an exception with respect to express parental consent to such sale, purchase, or use. Requires enforcement of this Act by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as if violations were unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Requires enforcement of compliance by other Federal agencies under other specified laws. Authorizes enforcement actions by States acting on behalf of their residents. Gives the FTC the right to intervene in such actions. Precludes State actions during the pendency of FTC actions.</summary>
