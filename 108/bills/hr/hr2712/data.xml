  <summary>7/10/2003--Introduced.
Emergency Directed Rail Service Act - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize the Surface Transportation Board, in order to promote commerce and service to the public, to direct the continued operation of freight or commuter rail passenger transportation operations in case of a failure caused by a cessation of service by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). Directs the Board to provide funding (including the payment of increased insurance premiums) to support such operations. States that in the case of a failure of existing freight or commuter rail passenger transportation operations caused by cessation of service by Amtrak , the Board may not direct a rail carrier to undertake specified activities to continue operations unless: (1) the Board first affirmatively finds that the rail carrier is operationally capable of conducting the directed service in a safe and efficient manner; and (2) funding for such directed service is provided in advance in appropriations Acts.</summary>
