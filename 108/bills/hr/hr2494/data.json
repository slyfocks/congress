Repeals provisions of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 prohibiting certain transactions, payments, or U.S. court recognition with respect to confiscated marks, trade names, or commercial names. Requires the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office to establish an electronic and publicly accessible registry of U.S. trademarks and well-known marks in Cuba. Amends the Cuban Assets Control Regulations to authorize: (1) specified transactions and proceedings regarding blocked foreign domain and trade names by any person who is not a designated national; (2) the transfer or receipt of any trademark, trade name, or domain name subject to U.S. law in which a designated national has an interest, as well as related proceedings; and (3) the payment of fees to foreign governments for research with respect to blocked foreign trademarks, trade names, and domain names, and related enforcement. Makes conforming amendments to the Trademark Act of 1946. Gives U.S. courts authority to validate any assertion by a designated national of rights in any mark or trade name based on common law rights or registration under specified provisions of the Trademark Act."
