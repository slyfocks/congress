Prohibits claims involving other cancers without prima facie evidence which shall include specified minimum requirements. Declares that no prima facie evidence is necessary in a civil action alleging an asbestos claim based upon mesothelioma.Requires the use of AMA guidelines or other authoritative standards.Sets forth requirements concerning claim consolidation (with consent only if not members of the same household), venue, preliminary proceedings, and removal.Delineates the statute of limitations for claims for asbestos conditions.Sets forth certain requirements for the scope of liability and damages involving civil actions under this Act, including that: (1) a defendant shall be liable only for that portion of a judgment that the defendant has responsibility for; and (2) no punitive damages may be awarded.Sets forth liability rules applicable to product sellers, renters, and lessors."
