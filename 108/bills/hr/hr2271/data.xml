  <summary>5/22/2003--Introduced.
Second Century of Flight Act - Establishes in the Department of Transportation an Office of Aerospace and Aviation Liaison (OAAL) to coordinate aviation and aeronautics research programs. Establishes within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) a National Air Traffic Management System Development Office, which shall develop a next generation air traffic management system plan for the United States. Directs the OAAL to report to specified congressional committees on market developments and government policies influencing the competitiveness of the U.S. jet transport aircraft industry. Directs the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FAA Administrator to establish a joint aerospace workforce initiative of grants to increase the number of students in technical training and certificate programs, as well as studying for undergraduate and graduate degrees, in aerospace-related fields. Authorizes the NASA and FAA Administrators to provide loans (scholarships for service) of up to $5,000 per year to fulltime students enrolled in an undergraduate or post-graduate program leading to an advanced degree in an aerospace-related field. Directs the FAA Administrator to: (1) continue the research grant program to improve airfield pavements; (2) review whether its asphalt and concrete airfield pavement standards accord with its standard 20-year-life requirement; (3) arrange with the National Research Council (NRC) to assess the FAA wake turbulence research and development program; (4) establish a cabin air quality research program; (5) exercise leadership with its foreign counterparts in the International Civil Aviation Organization; (6) report to specified congressional committees on aviation and aeronautical safety, and research funding and technological actions in other countries; (7) conduct research to promote development of analytical tools to improve existing certification methods and reduce overall certification costs; (8) develop a Center for Excellence focused on applied research and training with respect to advanced materials in transport airframe structures; and (9) study and report to specified congressional committees on ways to reduce aircraft noise and emissions and increase aircraft fuel efficiency. Authorizes the FAA Administrator to conduct a limited pilot program of incentives to airspace users for deployment of new technologies. Amends Federal transportation law to provide for FAA issuance of design organization certificates authorizing design organizations to certify compliance with certain requirements and minimum standards for the type certification of aircraft, aircraft engines, propellers, or appliances. Directs the NASA Administrator to: (1) develop a a ten-year aeronautics research plan; (2) study and report to specified congressional committees on markets enabled by environmental technologies for future aircraft; (3) convert and expand the vehicle systems program into a vehicle-enabling technologies program; (4) develop innovative software-validation technologies; (5) increase research into weather sensors and prediction; (6) develop a National Center for Advanced Materials Performance; and (7) submit unified annual program budgets to specified congressional committees.</summary>
