Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act - (Sec. 2) Provides for the per capita distribution of shares of specified funds appropriated in satisfaction of a judgment award granted to the Western Shoshone Indians in Docket Number 326-K before the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) to U.S. citizens who have at least 1/4 Western Shoshone blood and who are enrolled on a Western Shoshone Judgment Roll to be established by the Secretary of the Interior. Requires the Secretary to establish a Western Shoshone Judgement Roll consisting of all individuals who have at least 1/4 degree of Western Shoshone Blood, are U.S. citizens, and are living on the date of enactment of this Act. Makes ineligible for enrollment under this Act any individual who is eligible to receive other judgment awards from the ICC, the United States Claims Court, or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Requires the Secretary to publish rules and regulations governing the establishment of the Judgment Roll and specifies per capita distribution requirements (including those for heirs of deceased beneficiaries, incompetents, minors and individuals under age 19).

Requires the Secretary to establish, for the benefit of Western Shoshone members, the Western Shoshone Educational Trust Fund, to which such funds shall be credited. Requires that all accumulated and future interest and income from the Trust Fund be distributed: (1) as educational grants and assistance to individual Western Shoshone members as determined appropriate by the Administrative Committee established by this Act to oversee such distribution; and (2) to pay reasonable and necessary expenses of such Committee. Specifies the membership and duties of the Committee.</summary>
