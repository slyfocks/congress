Authorizes a holder of a license for a sensitive nuclear facility to petition the Commission for additional requirements in the security plan for such facility. Requires the NRC to establish a hiring and training program for the nuclear security force. Establishes the Nuclear Security Fund for use by the Commission to administer the security programs for sensitive nuclear facilities."
