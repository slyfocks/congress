Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2003 - Exempts a nonprofit athletic organization from liability for harm caused by an act or omission in the adoption of rules for sanctioned or approved athletic competitions or practices if: (1) the organization was acting within the scope of its duties; (2) the organization was properly licensed, certified, or authorized for the competition or practice; and (3) the harm was not caused by the organization's willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. States that this exemption shall not be construed to affect civil actions brought by nonprofit athletic organizations against their employees, agents, or volunteers. Makes exceptions where State law: (1) requires such an organization to adhere to risk management procedures, including mandatory training; (2) makes the organization liable for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, and volunteers to the same extent as an employer is liable for its employees; and (3) makes a limitation of liability inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of a State or local government. Preempts inconsistent State laws except for those that provide additional protections from liability relating to the rule-making activities of nonprofit athletic organizations.</summary>
