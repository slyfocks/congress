    "text": "Combat Meth Act - Directs the Attorney General to carry out a program to provide grants to qualified States (i.e., those which had more than 200 methamphetamine lab seizures in 2003 and that provide a specified mandatory minimum sentence for possession and/or distribution of five grams or more of methamphetamine or 50 grams or more of a substance containing methamphetamine) to combat methamphetamine abuse, focusing on the prosecution of repeat offenders. Authorizes funds to provide training to: (1) State and local prosecutors and law enforcement agents for investigation and prosecution of methamphetamine offenses; and (2) State law enforcement personnel at the Drug Enforcement Administration's Clandestine Laboratory Training Facility in Quantico, Virginia. Amends: (1) the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to expand the public safety and community policing grant program to authorize the use of grant funds to hire personnel and purchase equipment to assist in enforcing and prosecuting methamphetamine offenses and in cleaning up methamphetamine-affected areas; and (2) the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to local governments and nonprofit private entities to provide treatment for methamphetamine abuse. Directs the Attorney General to allocate funds for the hiring and training of special assistant U.S. attorneys. Authorizes the Attorney General, acting through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, to award grants to States to establish methamphetamine precursor monitoring programs."
