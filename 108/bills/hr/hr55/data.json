    "text": "Export Administration Act of 2003 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Commerce Control List. Specifies the kinds of export licenses the Secretary may require with respect to the export of an item on the Control List or otherwise subject to control under this Act. Provides, under specified circumstances, that a license shall not be required for the export of after-market service or replacement parts.Authorizes the President to prohibit, curtail, or require a license, or other authorization for the export of an item subject to the national security export control regimes under this Act. Sets forth the purposes of such controls, including restriction on the export of items (including weapons of mass destruction) that would contribute to the military potential of countries so as to be detrimental to the national security of the United States.Requires the Secretary to establish a National Security Control List as part of the Control List.Requires the Secretary (on a continuing basis, upon a request from the Office of Technology Evaluation, or upon receipt of a petition filed by an interested party) to review and determine the foreign availability and the mass-market status of any item for export control under this Act.Authorizes the President, subject to specified exceptions, to prohibit, curtail, or require a license, other authorization, recordkeeping, or reporting for the export of an item subject to the foreign policy export control regimes under this Act.Requires a license for the export to a terrorist-supporting country of any item that could make a significant contribution to the country's military potential, or could enhance its ability to support acts of international terrorism.Requires a license for the export of crime control and detection instruments and equipment, with specified exceptions.Sets forth procedures for the processing of export license applications, including their screening, referral, approval or denial, and review.Declares it is U.S. policy to seek multilateral arrangements, and to continue to participate in existing and additional multilateral export control regimes, that: (1) support U.S. national security interests; and (2) establish fairer and more predictable competitive opportunities for U.S. exporters.Directs the President to issue regulations that, with specified exceptions, prohibit U.S. persons from supporting any boycott imposed by a foreign country against a country friendly to the United States that is not itself the object of a U.S. boycott.
