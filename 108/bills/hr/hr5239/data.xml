National Guard and Reserve Education Act of 2004 - Increases the monthly rate of educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve who pursue full-time studies. Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prescribe by regulation the rate of assistance for less than full-time studies. Establishes an educational assistance benefit for reservists and National Guard members who, on or after September 11, 2001, serve at least 180 days within a five-year period of active duty in a contingency operation. Authorizes such persons to use their educational assistance entitlement during a 14-year period beginning on the last day of duty. Authorizes members of the Selected Reserve who are entitled to retired pay and basic educational assistance to transfer a portion of their educational entitlement to eligible dependents. Requires the Secretary to report on such transfers in the Secretary's annual report to Congress.</summary>
