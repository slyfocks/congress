(Sec. 2023) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into wildfire firefighting contracts with State and local governmental entities. (Sec. 2024) Authorizes the Secretary to allow a non-Federal interest credit (with limitations) for the cost of materials and in-kind services (but not including construction) provided for implementation of a project. (Sec. 2025) Amends the WRDA of 1974 to authorize the Secretary to provide technical assistance to a governmental agency or non-Federal interest in managing water resources. Authorizes annual appropriations. (Sec. 2026) Authorizes the Secretary to establish centers to provide specialized planning expertise for water resources projects to be carried out by the Secretary to enhance and supplement the capabilities of the Corps districts. (Sec. 2027) Directs the Secretary, upon the request of a non-Federal interest, to establish a schedule for consolidating Federal, State, local agency, and Indian tribe environmental assessments, project reviews, and issuance of all permits for the construction or modification of a project. Requires: (1) notice of such request in the Federal Register; (2) implementation of a scheduling agreement and agreement revisions; (3) reimbursement of costs associated with agreement implementation; and (4) a report to Congress on the time required for issuance of all necessary permits. (Sec. 2028) Requires the Secretary to develop and implement a coordinated water resources development project review process. Requires: (1) all necessary project reviews, assessments, etc. to be conducted concurrently and completed within an established time period; and (2) notification of the failure of a Federal, State, or local agency, Indian tribe, or non-Federal interest to meet such deadline (requiring reports from such party on why the deadline was not met). Directs the Secretary to: (1) define the purpose and need for the proposed project; and (2) determine which alternatives are reasonable and may be reasonably anticipated to meet such purposes and needs. Requires the Secretary to develop and publish a list of categorical exclusions from the requirement that an environmental assessment or impact statement be prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for water resources projects. Requires the Chief of Engineers to: (1) establish benchmarks for determining appropriate lengths of time for a project feasibility study and its associated review process; and (2) use of such benchmarks as a management tool to make the feasibility study process more efficient in all Corps districts. (Sec. 2029) Amends the WRDA of 1986 to add specified lakes and ponds in Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina to the lakes remediation program. (Sec. 2030) Amends the WRDA of 1986 to authorize the Secretary, when it is not technically feasible to complete mitigation of a project's fish and wildlife losses by the last day of a project's construction (current law), to complete such mitigation as expeditiously as possible, but not later than the last day of the first fiscal year beginning after the last day of construction of the project or separable project element thereof. Outlines mitigation plan contents. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the construction status of projects that require such mitigation and the status of such mitigation. (Sec. 2031) Authorizes the Secretary, in order to expedite the cost-effective design and construction of wetlands restoration that is part of an authorized project, to enter into cooperative agreements with nonprofit organizations with expertise in such restoration. Limits the amount of payments to such organizations. (Sec. 2032) Requires, as the Federal objective of any feasibility study for a water resource project, to maximize the net national economic development or ecosystem restoration benefits associated with the project. Authorizes the Secretary to select a project alternative that does not maximize such benefits if there is an overriding reason based upon other Federal, State, local, or international concerns. Provides examples of possible overriding reasons with respect to certain types of projects. Authorizes the Secretary to identify additional benefits with respect to a project, and to recommend construction of a separate project or element to achieve those benefits. Requires feasibility studies for flood damage reduction projects to include a calculation of benefits and costs associated with the project. (Sec. 2033) Requires project studies to be subject to peer review by an independent panel of experts if the project has an estimated total cost of more than $50 million, and is not determined by the Chief of Engineers to be exempt from such peer review. Outlines situations under which a project study may be: (1) subject to discretionary peer review, including when the Chief determines that a project study is controversial; and (2) excluded from peer review, including when the project is determined to be non-controversial or having only negligible adverse impacts on scarce or unique resources. Authorizes the appeal of a decision whether to peer review a project. Requires the Chief to determine the timing of a peer review. Provides for the establishment of panels to conduct necessary peer reviews, requiring such panels to generally complete such reviews within 180 days.
