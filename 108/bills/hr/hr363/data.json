    "text": "Jumpstart Broadband Act - Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate no less than an additional 255 megahertz of contiguous spectrum in the 5 gigahertz band for unlicensed use by wireless broadband devices while ensuring that Department of Defense devices and systems are not compromised.Directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to establish standards for interference protection which enable incumbent Federal government agency users of such allocated spectrum to continue such use.Directs the FCC to: (1) adopt minimal technical and device rules for efficient use of such allocated spectrum by wireless broadband devices; and (2) amend its rules to require that all wireless broadband devices manufactured after such rules amendment that operate in such allocated spectrum be capable of two-way digital communications and meet the interference protection standards."
