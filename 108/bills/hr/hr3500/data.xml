Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain the national 2004 marketing quota for Flue-cured and Burley tobacco at 2003 levels. Provides that: (1) A producer-owned cooperative marketing association may fully settle, without further cost to the association, a loan made for the 2004 crop of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco by forfeiting to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) the Flue-cured or Burley tobacco covered by the loan regardless of the condition of the tobacco; (2) any resultant CCC losses shall not be charged to the No Net Cost Tobacco Account; or affect certain related assessments; and (3) forfeited tobacco shall not be counted towards quotas, or sold for use in the United States.</summary>
