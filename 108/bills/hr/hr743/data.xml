  <summary>3/2/2004--Public Law.
Social Security Protection Act of 2004 - Title I: Protection of Beneficiaries - Subtitle A: Representative Payees - (Sec. 101) Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI), VIII (Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans), and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to fully reimburse Social Security beneficiaries for any part of their title II, VIII, or XVI benefits that was misused by a representative payee that is either: (1) not an individual (that is, an organization); or (2) an individual serving 15 or more beneficiaries during any month. Defines misuse of benefits as occurring when a representative payee receives payment for the use and benefit of another person or of another qualified individual and uses any part of it other than for the use and benefit of such person or individual. Excludes reissued benefits from an individual's resources. (Sec. 102) Requires non-governmental representative payees to certify annually that they are bonded and State-licensed. Directs the Commissioner to: (1) provide for the periodic onsite review of certain representative payees; and (2) report to Congress on the number of cases in which a representative payee was changed and the number of times in which a misuse of funds was discovered. (Sec. 103) Prohibits a prospective representative payee from receiving anyone's title II, VIII, or XVI benefit if the prospective representative payee: (1) has been convicted of any offense under Federal or State law resulting in imprisonment for more than one year (unless the Commissioner deems such payment would be appropriate notwithstanding such conviction); or (2) is a person fleeing prosecution, custody, or confinement for a felony. Forbids a fugitive felon from serving as a representative payee. Directs the Commissioner to assist law enforcement officials in apprehending such persons by providing them with the address, Social Security number, photograph, and other identifying information upon request. Directs the Commissioner to evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on whether the existing procedures and reviews for the qualification and disqualification of representative payees are sufficient to guard against misuse of benefits. (Sec. 104) Prohibits a representative payee from collecting a fee for services under titles II and XVI for any month if the Commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative payee has misused any amount of a benefit for such month. Declares that any amount so collected by a representative payee shall be counted as a misused part of the benefit. (Sec. 105) Provides that a representative payee that is not a Federal, State, or local government agency will be held liable for misuse of funds collected under titles II, VIII, and XVI, and that any misused amount recovered by the Commissioner shall be refunded to the beneficiary or the alternative representative payee. (Sec. 106) Permits the Commissioner to require a representative payee to receive payments at the local Social Security field office if the payee has failed to furnish an annual report or a report requested by the Commissioner. (Sec. 107) Provides certain additional funds to the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration to conduct a statistically significant survey to determine how payments made to individuals, organizations, and State or local government agencies that are representative payees for benefits paid under SSA title II or XVI are being managed and used on behalf of the beneficiaries for whom such benefits are paid. Subtitle B: Enforcement - (Sec. 111) Provides that each misuse of benefits under titles II, VIII, and XVI by a representative payee shall be punishable by a civil penalty of up to $5,000, as well as an assessment of up to twice the value of any misused payments. Title II: Program Protections - (Sec. 201) Amends SSA title XI to provide for the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments, and sanctions for the failure to come forward and notify the Social Security Administration of changed circumstances that affect eligibility or benefit amount when the person knows, or should know, that the failure to come forward is misleading. (Sec. 202) Directs the Commissioner, until a centralized computer file recording the date of information submission is in place, to issue a receipt to the beneficiary or representative each time such individual submits documentation or reports to the Commissioner on a change in status. (Sec. 203) Amends SSA title II to deny OASDI benefits to any individual fleeing prosecution or confinement after conviction of an act or attempted act that constitutes a felony, or, in jurisdictions that do not define crimes as felonies, is punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of the actual sentence imposed. (Currently the Commissioner may deny fugitive felons SSI benefits.) Prohibits benefits also for those violating probation or parole under Federal or State law. Allows the Commissioner to pay such withheld OASDI benefits for good cause shown if the offense or probation or parole violation was nonviolent and not drug-related. Requires the Commissioner to do so in the event of an acquittal, dismissal of charges, vacating of an arrest warrant, or erroneous implication in connection with the criminal offense by reason of identity fraud. Requires the Commissioner to furnish any law enforcement officer with personal information about any beneficiary, upon request, if: (1) the beneficiary is fleeing prosecution or confinement, or violating a condition of probation or parole; and (2) the location or apprehension of the beneficiary is within the officer's official duties.
