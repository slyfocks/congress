    "text": "Dietary Supplement Regulatory Implementation Act of 2004 - Makes appropriations for FY 2005, and authorizes appropriations for FY 2006 through 2009: (1) to carry out the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the amendments made by DSHEA, and all applicable regulatory requirements for dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and (2) for expanded research and development of consumer information, including information on safety and beneficial effects, of dietary supplements by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to: (1) fully and appropriately use such funds to regulate dietary supplements; (2) report annually on DSHEA implementation and enforcement; (3) carry out programs to educate health professionals and consumers on the safety and health benefits of the dietary supplements, including the potential for interactions of dietary supplements and drugs (using specified funds authorized by this Act); and (4) establish a system for the requirements for the reporting of serious adverse experiences associated with the use of a dietary supplement received by the manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the label of the product. Expresses the sense of the Congress regarding dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids."
