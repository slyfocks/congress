  <summary>6/2/2004--Introduced.
Long Island Sound Protection Act - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to revise requirements for the dumping of dredged material in Long Island Sound. Prohibits dredged material from any Federal or non-Federal dredging project from being dumped, or transported for the purpose of being dumped, into Long Island Sound, Fisher's Island Sound, Block Island Sound, or Peconic Bay (including any harbor or tributary of such bodies of water) until the dredged material is determined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) have, or to cause, concentrations of chemical constituents that are not greater than those concentrations present in the water column, sediments, and biota of areas proximate to, but unaffected by, the proposed disposal site; and (2) meet certain Federal dumping requirements. Prohibits dumping or transportation for dumping into any covered body of water, except at a site designated by the Administrator, and upon a determination that no feasible alternative to ocean disposal (including sediment remediation, beneficial reuse, and land-based alternatives) is available prior to the time of designation. Requires the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator, before designation of a dredged material disposal site in a covered body of water, to develop a dredged material management plan and to submit it to Congress and to the Governors of the States of Connecticut and New York for their approval.</summary>
