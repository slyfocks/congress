Residual Radioactive Contamination Compensation Act - Amends the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 to cover individual employees: (1) at an atomic weapons employer facility with respect to which the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found a potential for residual contamination outside of the period in which weapons-related production occurred; and (2) during a period of significant residual contamination at such facility. Instructs the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit to Congress updated reports regarding residual contamination in such facilities and the employees working in them while their employers were under Federal contract to process nuclear weapons materials.</summary>
