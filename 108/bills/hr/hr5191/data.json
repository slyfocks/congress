Changes the date for the meeting of electors, in such an event, from the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following their appointment to the first day after January 1 following their appointment. Changes the date for the counting of electoral votes in a joint session of Congress from the sixth day of January succeeding the meeting of the electors in the States to the second day following the extended deadline for the receipt of certificates and votes by the President of the Senate or the Archivist of the United States. Reduces from six to three days the \"safe harbor\" period for resolution of any controversy or contest regarding appointment of State electors."
