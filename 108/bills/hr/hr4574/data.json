    "text": "National Security Education Program Enhancement Act of 2004 - Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1992 to require the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to transfer specified amounts to the Secretary of Education from Intelligence Community Management (ICM) appropriations to carry out national security education scholarship, fellowship, and grant programs. Revises post-education service obligations for such programs to: (1) allow a delay in the commencement of service obligations; (2) require only a one-year obligation for scholarship recipients; and (3) allow service obligations to be served with a variety of Federal agencies. Requires the DCI to transfer ICM funds to carry out grant programs for the National Flagship Language Initiative (an Initiative for achieving advanced proficiency in languages designated as critical to national security). Amends the David L. Boren National Security Education Act of 1991 to require students receiving training under the Initiative to enter into service agreements with the intelligence community element providing such training or reimburse the United States. Directs the Secretary of Defense to take steps to increase the number of qualified educational institutions receiving Initiative grants. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to award scholarships to U.S. citizens who are native speakers of languages designated as critical and not proficient at a professional level in English to enable them to pursue English studies. Requires recipients to enter into service agreements. Requires the DCI to transfer ICM funds to carry out such program."
