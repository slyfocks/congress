Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) determine whether pentabrominated diphenyl ethers or octabrominated diphenyl ethers are formed in the environment as the result of chemical degradation of other materials and to identify any such precursors; (2) take appropriate action to ensure that products and processes that introduce identified precursors into the environment are phased out within three years of enactment of this Act, unless doing so would endanger human health and the environment; and (3) issue regulations requiring any product containing pentabrominated diphenyl ethers, octabrominated diphenyl ethers, or decabrominated diphenyl ethers that is manufactured 18 months or more after enactment of this Act to bear a label that meets specified requirements."
