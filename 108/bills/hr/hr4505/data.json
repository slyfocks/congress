Directs the SEC to require each senior executive officer of an investment adviser to certify in periodic reports to shareholders that specified procedures are in place to verify compliance with transparency and specified ethical considerations. Grants whistleblower protection for employees of publicly traded companies and registered investment companies. Directs the SEC to develop standardized disclosures for: (1) expense and transaction cost ratios; (2) cost structures; (3) investment adviser compensation; (4) point of sale; and (5) additional disclosures of broker compensation.
