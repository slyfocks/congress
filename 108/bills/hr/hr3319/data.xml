  <summary>10/16/2003--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to permit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to register a Canadian pesticide that: (1) has not been previously disapproved; (2) is identical or substantially similar in composition to a comparable domestic pesticide already registered; and (3) is registered in Canada by the registrant (or affiliate) of the comparable domestic pesticide. Requires the Administrator to obtain the confidential statement of formula for the pesticide to determine if it is in fact identical or substantially similar to a comparable domestic pesticide. Stipulates that any Canadian pesticide the Administrator registers must bear an approved label which completely covers the original Canadian label. Prohibits actions in Federal court against: (1) the Administrator acting as a registering agency for damages resulting from the use of a product registered under this Act; or (2) registrants for damages resulting from adulteration or compositional alterations of such a product if the registrant could not reasonably have knowledge of such adulteration or alterations.</summary>
