Requires the Administrator to obtain the confidential statement of formula for the pesticide to determine if it is in fact identical or substantially similar to a comparable domestic pesticide. Stipulates that any Canadian pesticide the Administrator registers must bear an approved label which completely covers the original Canadian label. Prohibits actions in Federal court against: (1) the Administrator acting as a registering agency for damages resulting from the use of a product registered under this Act; or (2) registrants for damages resulting from adulteration or compositional alterations of such a product if the registrant could not reasonably have knowledge of such adulteration or alterations."
