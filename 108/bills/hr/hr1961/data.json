Grants the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) nuclear safety regulatory and enforcement responsbilities, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) occupational safety and health regulatory and enforcement responsibilities with regard to such facilities. Authorizes the NRC to regulate both the DOE and DOE contractors through licensing and certification. Holds a contractor operating a DOE nonmilitary energy laboratory harmless from facility decommissioning costs or from any violation of NRC decommissioning requirements if such violation results from DOE failure to authorize or fund decommissioning activities.States OSHA and the NRC both share regulatory and enforcement responsibilities regarding a hazard at a nonmilitary DOE energy laboratory that presents a risk of occupational exposure and contains both a radiological and non-radiological component."
