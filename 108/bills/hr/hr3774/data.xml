  <summary>2/4/2004--Introduced.
National Resilience Development Act of 2003 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene and lead an interagency task force to increase the psychological resilience of the American public and improve the ability of Federal, State and local governments to respond to the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impacts of terrorism and their implications for disaster management. Amends the Act and Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (USA Patriot Act) of 2001 and the Public Health Service Act to permit certain grants to be used to enable mental health authorities to better understand and manage human emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses to disasters, including by increasing the psychological resilience of the public and mitigate distress reactions and maladaptive behavior that could occur in response to a conventional, biological, chemical or radiological attack on the United States. Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to integrate into its functions efforts to mitigate, plan, and recover from psychological injury and consequences of trauma.</summary>
