  <summary>5/19/2003--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Veterans Health Care Cost Recovery Act of 2003 - Prohibits the absence of a participation agreement or other contractual arrangement entered into by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a health-plan contract or with a preferred provider organization from being used to, or from operating to, prevent or reduce the amount of any veterans' medical care cost recovery or collection by the United States. Mandates that whenever the Secretary furnishes care and services to a person other than a veteran, the United States shall have the right to recover the costs of such care and services in the same manner and to the same extent as care and services provided to a veteran. Designates the following Department of Veterans Affairs facilities as follows: (1) the health care facility located at 820 South Damen Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, as the Jesse Brown Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center; and (2) the outpatient clinic in New London, Connecticut, as the John J. McGuirk Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.</summary>
