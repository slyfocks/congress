Directs the Council, in carrying out the demonstration project, to ensure that specified requirements are met with respect to: (1) communications; (2) access to technologies, information, or other resources; (3) participation (limited to those employees who would otherwise have been eligible to telework); and (4) coordination with otherwise existing Federal telework policies, requirements, and funding."
