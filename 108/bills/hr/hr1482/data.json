Requires an appropriate percentage of such assistance for FY 2006 and each subsequent fiscal year to be made available to such organizations. Prescribes general requirements with respect to Afghanistan for: (1) its governance; (2) post-conflict stability; (3) training for military and police forces; and (4) relief, resettlement, and repatriation of refugees and internally displaced persons."
