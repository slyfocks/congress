Prohibits any entity that handles, manages, treats, releases, disposes, stores, transports, or delivers covered substances from disproportionately exposing any individual or community, on the ground of race, color, national origin, or economic status to any covered substance. Authorizes enforcement: (1) by denial or termination of authorization to handle, manage, treat, release, discharge, dispose, store, transport, remove, move, or deliver covered substances; (2) by any other means authorized by law; and (3) for entities receiving Federal financial assistance, through specified compliance provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
