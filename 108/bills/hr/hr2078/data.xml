  <summary>5/13/2003--Introduced.
Employees' Pension Equity Act of 2003 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require the funding of all other employees' non-executive pension plans to be within a certain range in relation to the funding for executive pension plans for highly compensated employees, if both types of pension plans are maintained by the same employer. Sets a five-percent limit on the excess executive plan funding percentage for a plan year (by prohibiting the funded current liability percentage for the executive plan from exceeding that for the non-executive plan by more than five percent).</summary>
