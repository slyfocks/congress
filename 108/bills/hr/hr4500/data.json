Instructs the Secretary of Energy to conduct programs of energy research, development, demonstration, and commercial application (R&D) focused upon specified energy technologies, including: (1) a Next Generation Lighting Initiative; (2) a National Building Performance Initiative; (3) a secondary electric vehicle battery use program: (4) an Energy Efficiency Science Initiative; (5) electric motor control technology; and (6) Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers. Instructs the Secretary to develop research programs in the following energy technologies: (1) hybrid distributed power systems; (2) high power density industry program; (3) micro-cogeneration energy technology; (4) distributed energy technologies; and (5) after-treatment technologies for industrial reciprocating engines. Directs the Secretary to conduct R&D in the following areas: (1) diversified bioenergy programs; (2) concentrated solar power; and (3) renewable energy in public buildings. Directs the Secretary to implement specified nuclear energy R&D, including: (1) advanced fuel recycling technology; (2) university nuclear science and engineering support; and (3) reactor design security. Requires the Secretary to conduct R&D in: (1) specified aspects of oil and gas research; (2) coal mining technologies; and (3) ultra-deepwater and unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resource exploration and production. Directs the Secretary to establish the Ultra-Deepwater Advisory Committee. Establishes in the Treasury the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research Fund. Prescribes guidelines for United States participation in ITER (the international burning plasma fusion research project). Directs the Secretary to: (1) present an R&D plan to Congress for a fusion energy sciences program; and (2) report on the Spallation Neutron Source as part of the annual budget submission of the Department of Energy. Requires the Secretary to support and establish: (1) science and energy facilities and infrastructure; (2) catalysis research and development; (3) nanoscale science and engineering research; (4) advanced scientific computing for energy missions; (5) genomes to life program; and (6) fission and fusion energy materials research program. Prescribes implementation guidelines to establish: (1) the Energy-Water Supply Program; (2) the United States-Mexico Energy Technology Cooperation Program; (3) the Western Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Program; and (4) a biological nitrogen fixation program. Directs the Secretary to establish the Arctic Engineering Research Center to improve the overall performance of roads, bridges, residential, commercial, and industrial structures, and other infrastructure in the Arctic region. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) establish National Energy Research and Development Advisory Boards to perform external technical review of departmental programs; (2) designate a Technology Transfer Coordinator to perform oversight of and policy development for technology transfer activities at the Department; and (3) establish a Technology Infrastructure Program. Authorizes appropriations for the Secretary to establish a Department of Energy Science and Technology Scholarship Program. Directs the Secretary to require the Director of each National Laboratory to designate a small business advocate."
