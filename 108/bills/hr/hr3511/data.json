Prohibits any vendor from collecting or disclosing such information without the prior written or electronic consent of the subscriber, with certain business-related exceptions. Requires a vendor to provide subscriber access to all collected information, and to destroy information no longer necessary. Provides civil remedies for violations, including actual and punitive damages."
