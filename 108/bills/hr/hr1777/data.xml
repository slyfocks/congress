  <summary>4/11/2003--Introduced.
Instructs the Secretary of Energy to transmit to Congress a coordinated plan for a program conducted in partnership with the private sector that addresses: (1) hydrogen production from diverse energy sources, including fossil fuels; (2) safe delivery and storage of hydrogen or hydrogen-carrier fuels (including ethanol and methanol); (3) advanced vehicle technologies; (4) development of fuel cells and fuel-flexible fuel cell power systems; and (5) development of necessary codes and standards and safety practices for the production, distribution, storage, and use of hydrogen, hydrogen-carrier fuels, and related products. Directs the Secretary, in partnership with the private sector, to facilitate the deployment of: (1) hydrogen energy and energy infrastructure; (2) fuel cells; (3) advanced vehicle technologies; and (4) clean fuels in addition to hydrogen. Directs the President to establish an interagency task force chaired by the Secretary to work toward the specified goals of this Act. Establishes the Hydrogen Technical and Fuel Cell Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary on programs and activities. Mandates review of the implementation plan by a competitively selected nongovernmental entity, such as the National Academy of Sciences.</summary>
