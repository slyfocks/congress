  <summary>4/1/2004--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act to apply "non-ambulatory" to cattle, sheep, goat, swine, horse, mule, or other equine that, at the time of examination and inspection, is unable to rise from a recumbent position or unable to walk for any reason, including nerve paralysis, metabolic conditions, or central nervous condition disorder, unless the reason for such inability is fatigue or one or more broken or fractured appendages, severed tendons, or ligaments, or dislocated joints. Considers as adulterated cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines found at inspection: (1) to be non-ambulatory; (2) to test positive for central nervous disorders; (3) to exhibit signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy; or (4) to be dead.</summary>
