Native American Housing Enhancement Act of 2004 - Amends title V (Farm Housing) of the Housing Act of 1949 to state that federally recognized Indian tribes who exercise powers of self-government (or their instrumentalities) shall comply with the Indian Civil Rights Act (title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) when receiving assistance under title V. States that title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 shall not apply to tribes: (1) covered by the Indian Civil Rights Act (title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1968); or (2) tribes acting under affordable housing provisions of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996.
