  <summary>4/11/2003--Introduced.
National Uniform Privacy Standards Act of 2003 - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to extend Federal preemption over State consumer protection laws enacted after January 1, 2004, that declare their intent is to give greater protection to consumers than is provided under Federal law. (Thus denies the protection from Federal preemption currently granted to State consumer protection laws that provide greater protection than Federal law). Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to prohibit the States from imposing any requirement or prohibition with respect to consumer financial privacy that is currently regulated by such Act's privacy guidelines, including disclosure by a financial institution of a consumer's nonpublic personal information. (Thus establishes Federal preemption over State consumer protection laws that provide greater protection than Federal law).</summary>
