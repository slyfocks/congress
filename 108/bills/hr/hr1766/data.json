(Thus denies the protection from Federal preemption currently granted to State consumer protection laws that provide greater protection than Federal law). Amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to prohibit the States from imposing any requirement or prohibition with respect to consumer financial privacy that is currently regulated by such Act's privacy guidelines, including disclosure by a financial institution of a consumer's nonpublic personal information. (Thus establishes Federal preemption over State consumer protection laws that provide greater protection than Federal law)."
