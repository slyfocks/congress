San Diego Water Storage and Efficiency Act of 2004 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the Sweetwater Authority public water agency in San Diego, to undertake an appraisal investigation of opportunities for construction of a three-reservoir intertie system to improve water supply reliability and water yield of the existing non-Federal water storage system.
