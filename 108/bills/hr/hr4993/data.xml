  <summary>7/22/2004--Introduced.
Emergency Care Liability Relief Act - Limits noneconomic and punitive damages for injuries arising from the provision of uncompensated care by emergency care providers. Authorizes the award of attorney's fees and costs in actions in which a party's liability or such damages are contested. Requires liability for such awards to be allocated to the nonprevailing party personally, the attorney or law firm representing such party if representation was on a contingent fee basis, or both, taking into account specified factors. Requires the court, in actions in which liability or noneconomic or punitive damages described in this Act are contested, to instruct the jury that it must take into account the effect of the amount to be awarded in damages on the price and availability of health care liability insurance.</summary>
