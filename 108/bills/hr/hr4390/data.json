Expands the jurisdiction of the MEJA to cover the civilian employees, contractors, and employees of contractors of any Federal agency or provisional authority, and their dependents, to the extent that the employment relates to the mission of the Department of Defense overseas or to operations within territory that the United States occupies solely or jointly. Clarifies that the MEJA covers offenses that would constitute war crimes. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act containing regulations implementing the MEJA."
