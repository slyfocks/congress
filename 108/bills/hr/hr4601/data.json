    "text": "Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to recognize Alexander Creek in Seward Meridian, Alaska, as a Native village. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Alexander Creek account in the Treasury to be available to Alexander Creek Incorporated (an Alaska Native Group corporation) for bidding on and purchasing property sold at public sale, subject to this Act. Requires the: (1) Secretary of the Interior to enter into negotiations to attempt to conclude a land exchange to acquire the surface estate in lands not within any conservation system unit from the State of Alaska or the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to enable Alexander Creek to select additional public lands within its original withdrawal area; and (2) conveyance, without consideration, of the subsurface estate to such conveyed lands to the Cook Inlet Region Incorporated (the Regional Corporation for Alexander Creek). Provides that: (1) upon certification by the Secretary of the appraisal of lands selected for purchase, the Alexander Creek Incorporated shall be deemed to have accepted the terms of this Act in lieu of any other land entitlement it could have received pursuant to this Act; and (2) the acceptance shall satisfy all claims such Corporation had or may have had against the United States on the enactment of this Act."
