  <summary>11/18/2004--Introduced.
Fair Access and Individual Responsibilities Act of 2004 - Amends the Federal criminal code to double the number of members of the board of directors of Federal Prison Industries (FPI), provide for their appointment by the Attorney General, and designate the Director of the Bureau of Prisons as FPI's chief executive officer. Directs the Attorney General to appoint an independent review panel to advise the board regarding the type and quantity of products to be produced and conditions of hire and work. Makes the Attorney General responsible for protecting Federal inmate participation rights and for facilitating their ability to meet financial responsibilities through successful competitive participation in the U.S. economy. Designates prison industries as Class A (established as of December 31, 2002), B (established on or after January 1, 2005, and carried out by a competitive, independent, taxpaying entity), C (carried out by a private entity located in a Federal correctional institution), and D (pilot industries created to test reform of inmate employment and prison industries) industries. Repeals (with an exception) requirements regarding the purchase of prison-made products by Federal departments on December 31, 2010. Authorizes the Attorney General to make matching grants to specified organizations to attract firms and create business entities in Federal and State correctional settings. Requires the Director to establish procedures to ensure that inmate workers have the right to join a labor organization and engage in collective bargaining. Directs the Attorney General to modify correctional practices to improve the attractiveness and efficiency of Federal correctional facilities to ensure maximum inmate employment at prevailing wages.</summary>
