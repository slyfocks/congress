Allows exceptions for each food similar to those to be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.States that nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the prohibition under a specified Federal regulation on the use of sewage sludge in organic food production under the National Organic Program of the Department of Agriculture."
