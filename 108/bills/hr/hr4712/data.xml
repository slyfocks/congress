OSHA and Employer Cooperation Act of 2004 - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to revise certain enforcement provisions. Sets periods of 30 workdays for: (1) issuing citations (currently with reasonable promptness or within a reasonable time); and (2) contesting citations (currently fifteen workdays). Prohibits the Secretary of Labor from: (1) assessing certain penalties in connection with the initial issuance of a citation, with the exception of willful violations, if the employer corrects the condition in violation and provides an abatement certification within 72 hours; (2) citing on multiemployer worksites any but the employer whose employees were exposed to a condition in violation; or (3) using other than serious citations as a basis for issuing subsequent, repeat, or willful citations. Requires inspectors, at closing conferences after completing inspections, to provide employers or their representatives with written statements providing specified information.</summary>
