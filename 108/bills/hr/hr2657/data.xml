  <summary>9/30/2003--Public Law.
Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2004 - Title I: Legislative Branch Appropriations - Makes FY 2004 appropriations for the Senate for: (1) expense allowances; (2) representation allowances for the Majority and Minority Leaders; (3) salaries of specified officers, employees, and committees (including the Committee on Appropriations); (4) agency contributions for employee benefits; (5) inquiries and investigations; (6) the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control; (7) the Offices of the Secretary and of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate; (8) miscellaneous items; (9) the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account; and (10) official mail costs. (Sec. 1) Increases by $50,000 the allowances for administrative and clerical assistance in the offices of Senators. (Sec. 2) Removes the current cap (a maximum of $100,000 each) on the annual expense allowance of Conferences of the Majority and the Minority. (Sec. 3) Authorizes the Senate Commission on Art to accept gifts of money and acquire (by gift, purchase, or otherwise) any work of art, historical object, document, or material relating to historical matters, or exhibit, for placement or exhibition in the Senate Wing of the Capitol, the Senate Office Buildings, or in its rooms, spaces, or corridors. Allows the Commission to retain such items for accession to the U.S. Senate Collection or other use or to dispose of them by sale or other transactions. Repeals Senate Resolution 95, 92d Congress, agreed to April 1, 1971, and enacted into law by Public Law 100-696 (providing additional authority to acquire works of art, historical objects, documents or exhibits for placement or exhibition in the Senate Wing of the Capitol, the Senate Office Buildings, or in its rooms, spaces, or corridors). Establishes the Curatorial Advisory Board to provide advice and assistance to the Commission on the acquisition, care, and disposition of items for or within the U.S. Senate Collection, and on such other matters as the Commission determines. Authorizes the Commission, or the chairman and vice chairman acting jointly on behalf of the Commission and after notifying it, to establish one or more additional advisory boards. Establishes in the Treasury the Senate Preservation Fund to be available to the Commission for the payment of acquisition and transaction costs incurred for such acquisitions, for official activities of the advisory boards, and for any purposes for which funds from the contingent fund of the Senate may be used for conservation, restoration, replication, or replacement of items. Requires the Library of Congress to provide financial management and disbursing services and support to the Commission as may be required and mutually agreed to by the Librarian of Congress and Executive Secretary of the Commission. Amends Senate Resolution 382, 90th Congress, as agreed to October 1, 1968, and enacted into law by Public Law 100-696, to make the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate the chairman and vice chairman of the Commission. Requires the Secretary of the Senate to appoint (currently, the Commission to select) a Senate Curator approved by the Commission. Requires the Secretary to assign additional employees to assist the Commission, and to provide such other assistance as the Commission determines necessary. Provides for the use of Senate contingent funds for the purchase of art and historical objects for the U.S. Senate Collection, for exhibits and public education relating to such Collection, and for administrative and transitional expenses of the Commission. (Sec. 4) Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1979 and other Federal law to increase the maximum annual expense allowances of: (1) the Office of the Secretary of the Senate and the Office of Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate for orientation seminars from $10,000 each to $25,000 each; and (2) the Secretary of the Senate, Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, and Secretaries for the Majority and Minority from $3,000 each to $6,000. (Sec. 6) Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1977 to increase from eight to nine the number of individual consultants the Majority and Minority Leaders may each appoint. (Sec. 7) Amends Public Law 101-302 to extend through FY 2004 and each fiscal year thereafter, the authorization for the use of certain unexpended and unobligated funds within the Senate contingent fund for expenses of the U.S. Senate Collection. (Sec. 8) Authorizes the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration to permit the installation of data communication lines and other appropriate Internet connections (not including voice connections) in the private residence of a Senator and up to two staff members designated by a Senator and the majority and minority staff director of a committee for conducting the work of the Senate, subject to Committee guidelines. (Sec. 9) Authorizes, under certain conditions and on a reimbursable basis, the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate to provide services and equipment funded by appropriations available to the Senate to persons and entities not funded by such appropriations. (Sec. 10) Permits a Senator from a noncontiguous State (including Alaska and Hawaii) to pay a high cost of living allowance to any employee (up to 25 percent of such individual's basic pay) employed in an office of the Senator located in that State. Treats the allowance as part of the employee's basic pay. Makes FY 2004 appropriations for the House of Representatives for: (1) salaries and/or expenses of the House leadership offices, committees (including the Committee on Appropriations), officers and employees, and the Child Care Center; and (2) Members' representational allowances. (Sec. 101) Makes amounts appropriated under this Act for Members' Representational Allowances available for FY 2004 only. Requires that amounts remaining after all allowance payments are made for FY 2004 be deposited in the Treasury and used for deficit reduction or, if there is no Federal budget deficit, for reducing the Federal debt. (Sec. 102) Prohibits funds in this Act from being used to provide supplemental dental or vision health insurance benefits for House Members or employees.
