(Sec. 104) Amends Federal law to provide that \"Member\" with respect to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) not only excludes an individual who irrevocably elects, by written notice to the official by whom such individual is paid, not to participate in FERS but excludes an individual who (in the case of an individual who is a Member of the House, including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner of Congress) serves as a Member before this Act's enactment.
