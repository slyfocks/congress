  <summary>1/29/2003--Introduced.
IDEA Paperwork Reduction Act of 2003 - Directs the Secretary of Education to report to specified congressional committees, with respect to the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), on advisable regulatory proposals to reduce: (1) the IDEA paperwork burden on teachers, administrators, and related services providers; and (2) the non-instructional time spent by teachers to comply with IDEA requirements.Directs the Secretary to: (1) identify, develop, and disseminate simplified and streamlined model documents for individualized education programs (IEPs), procedural safeguards notices, and prior written notice reporting requirements incorporating relevant Federal statutory and regulatory requirements under IDEA; and (2) disseminate and provide training and technical assistance on such model IEPs, notices, and requirements to all State and local educational agencies (LEAs), parent training centers, and other appropriate entities.Allows LEAs receiving funds under IDEA part B to offer parents the option of developing a comprehensive three-year IEP (instead of an annual IEP) for each child with disabilities, including goals coinciding with natural transition points for the child and certain annual goals.Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a demonstration program of granting waivers of IDEA paperwork requirements for up to four years for up to ten States, based on State proposals for addressing reduction of paperwork and non-instructional time spent fulfilling statutory and regulatory requirements. Requires the annual report of the Department of Education to Congress to include information on the efficacy and promise of such waivers.Amends IDEA to provide for flexibility with respect to IEP meetings, by allowing: (1) regular education teachers to be excused from attendance under certain circumstances; and (2) the parents and the LEA to agree to excuse any IEP team member from attending a meeting when such member's attendance is not necessary, as well as to waive, consolidate, or develop alternatives to certain meetings. Limits certain IEP information to what is specifically required. Revises requirements for procedural safeguard notices.</summary>
