    "text": "Health Insurance Certificate Act of 2003 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program for the issuance to eligible individuals of health insurance certificates to be applied towards the cost of qualified health insurance coverage for such individuals and family members. Declares that no certificate shall be issued to a family member who is covered under the eligible individual's qualified health insurance coverage. Prohibits more than one certificate from being used for any one person. States that a certificate may be used for a spouse and up to two other family members. Excludes an individual from counting as an eligible individual if such individual is eligible to be covered under any of specified medical programs (not counting Cobra continuation coverage). Declares that in no case shall the value of a certificate be applied towards an amount that exceeds 70 percent of the premium for coverage for a given period or 70 percent of an employee's premium for coverage under a group health plan. Sets forth procedures for calculating the value of certificates. Sets forth rules to cover certificates used to purchase coverage in group health plans. Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend funding for the operation of State high risk health insurance pools."
