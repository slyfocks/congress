Requires such information to be: (1) included in print, broadcast, and electronic advertisements; and (2) in English and in the same language as principally used by the institution or money transmitting business to advertise, solicit, or negotiate at that office if other than English. Requires the Federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the need for fee disclosures for money wire transmissions."
