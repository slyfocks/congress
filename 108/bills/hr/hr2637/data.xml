  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
Wire Transfer Fairness and Disclosure Act of 2003 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require a financial institution or money transmitting business initiating an international money transfer on behalf of a consumer to disclose prominently on its premises and on its forms and receipts: (1) the exchange rate used in the transaction; (2) the exchange rate prevailing at a major financial center of the pertinent foreign country as of close of business on the business day immediately preceding the transaction date; (3) all commissions and fees charged in such transaction; and (4) the exact amount of foreign currency to be received by the consumer in the foreign country. Requires such information to be: (1) included in print, broadcast, and electronic advertisements; and (2) in English and in the same language as principally used by the institution or money transmitting business to advertise, solicit, or negotiate at that office if other than English. Requires the Federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the need for fee disclosures for money wire transmissions.</summary>
