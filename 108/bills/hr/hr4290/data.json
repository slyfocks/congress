Defines \"data-mining\" as a query, search, or other analysis of one or more electronic databases, where: (1) at least one of the databases was obtained from or remains under the control of a non-Federal entity, or the information was acquired initially by another Federal department or agency for purposes other than intelligence or law enforcement; (2) the search does not use a specific individual's personal identifiers to acquire information concerning that individual; and (3) a Federal department or agency is conducting the query, search, or other analysis to find a pattern indicating terrorist or other criminal activity. Mandates annual updates, including any new data-mining technologies."
