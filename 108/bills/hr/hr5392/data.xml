  <summary>11/18/2004--Introduced.
Volunteer First Responder Fairness Act of 2004 - Authorizes the use of certain Department of Homeland Security grants to States, regions, or directly eligible tribes for reasonable stipends to paid-on-call or volunteer first responders for travel to or participation in training to prevent, prepare for, respond to, or mitigate threatened or actual terrorist attacks if compensation for such travel or participation is not otherwise provided. Prohibits any such stipend from being considered compensation for purposes of rendering a first responder an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.</summary>
