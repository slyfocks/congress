  <summary>5/22/2003--Introduced.
Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to direct owners or operators of publicly-owned treatment works to institute an alert system for sanitary sewer overflow. Requires that the public and the appropriate officials be notified as soon as practicable within 24 hours of the time the owner or operator becomes aware of the overflow. Requires a written report on the overflow, including magnitude and cause, as well as measures taken to eliminate and prevent its recurrence. States that owners or operators must report overflows on their monthly discharge monitoring report to either the State or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection, as appropriate. Makes these alert systems eligible for assistance and authorizes funding.</summary>
