Requires such request to include fingerprints of the employee. Prohibits such an employer from employing such an employee to provide any security service or function unless: (1) the employer first obtains the results of an NCIC criminal history records check; and (2) neither the results of that check nor any other information made available to the employer indicate that the employee has any unpardoned conviction under Federal or State law of any felony or of specified offenses. Prohibits such an employer from making such a request without the employee's consent. Requires an employer to ensure that information received under this Act is maintained confidentially, not misused, and destroyed within a specified time. Directs the Secretary to establish procedures to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security properly uses the results. Sets penalties for knowingly and intentionally using any information obtained pursuant to this Act for a purpose other than that of determining suitability for employment."
