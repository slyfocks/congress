Terminates the State option to exempt from such advancement one of its time zones alone. Permits such States to exempt only the entire State from daylight savings time advancement. Declares that this Act shall not apply to any State that, after enactment of this Act but before April 6, 2004, enacts a law exempting the entire area of the State lying within any time zone from the required advancement of time to daylight savings time."
