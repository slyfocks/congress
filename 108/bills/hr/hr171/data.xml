Homeowner Refinance Fairness Act of 2003 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to set the refinancing limitation on the deduction for home mortgage interest at $1,000,000, or $500,000 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return (presently the Code holds that in the case of a taxpayer who secures indebtedness on a residence by refinancing, there may not be a deduction for an amount of indebtedness which exceeds the amount of the refinanced indebtedness).</summary>
