(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 6, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Amends the Small Business Act to authorize a Small Business Development Center in an eligible State to apply for an additional Small Business Administration grant to be used solely to provide services to assist with outreach, development, and enhancement on Indian lands of small business startups and expansions owned by Indian tribe members, Native Alaskans, and Native Hawaiians (members and Natives). Defines an eligible State as one in which at least one percent of its population is comprised of such members and Natives. Limits each grant to $300,000 in a fiscal year.Requires a State receiving such a grant to request the advice of local tribal councils on how best to provide assistance to such members or Natives and where to locate satellite centers to provide such assistance.</summary>
