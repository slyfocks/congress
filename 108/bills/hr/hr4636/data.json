Requires the EPA, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish model guidelines and procedures for: (1) preliminary site assessment criteria for former methamphetamine laboratories; and (2) clean-up and remediation. Requires NIST to support a research program to develop: (1) new methamphetamine detection technologies; and (2) appropriate standard reference materials and validation procedures for methamphetamine detection testing. Directs the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to make available to the public a list of all methamphetamine laboratories that have undergone cleanup under the DEA's Clandestine Drug Laboratory Cleanup Program. Requires the EPA to enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) for a study of the residual effects of methamphetamine laboratories on residents of buildings where such laboratories are located, with particular emphasis on the health effects on children. Requires the NSF to enter into an arrangement with the Academy for a report on the societal costs of methamphetamine production and abuse."
