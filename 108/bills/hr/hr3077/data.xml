  <summary>10/21/2003--Passed House amended.
International Studies in Higher Education Act of 2003 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise requirements and reauthorize appropriations through FY 2009 for International Education Programs (title VI). (Sec. 2) Revises and reauthorizes international and foreign language studies programs (title VI part A). Includes among part A aims: (1) overseas linkages with institutions of higher education (IHEs) and other relevant organizations; and (2) helping the national effort to educate and train citizens to participate in homeland security efforts. Requires various grant programs to reflect part A purposes. Includes among authorized activities of national graduate and undergraduate language and area centers and programs: (1) supporting instructors of the less commonly taught languages; (2) disseminating materials developed by the center or program to local educational agencies (LEAs) and public and private elementary and secondary education schools (schools), and IHEs; and (3) projects supporting students' understanding of science and technology in coordination with foreign language proficiency. Revises requirements for outreach grants to and summer institutes of such centers to include partnerships (as well as programs of linkage and outreach) with: (1) two- and four-year IHEs, including colleges of education and teacher professional development programs; (2) Federal and State agencies; and (3) LEAs and schools. Includes, among authorized activities of undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs, the provision of grants to undergraduate students for educational programs abroad that are closely linked to the program's overall goals and that promote foreign language fluency and knowledge of world regions. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the authority of the Secretary of Education to: (1) establish requirements for undergraduate international studies and foreign language program evaluations; and (2) require program grant recipients to report annually on the progress and performance of participating students. Includes, among authorized research and study activities, systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data. Includes museums among the entities which may receive grants for technological innovation and cooperation for foreign information access. Includes among authorized uses of such grants: (1) acquiring foreign information resources in print or electronic forms; (2) developing standards for shared electronic access to international data; (3) establishing linkages between grant recipients with libraries, museums, organizations, or IHEs located overseas to help carry out grant purposes; and (4) other activities deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce the required non-Federal share for grantee IHEs if they: (1) are eligible for certain assistance under HEA title III (Institutional Aid) part A (Strengthening Institutions, including American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions) or part B (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) or title V (Developing Institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions) (IIIAB or V); and (2) submit grant applications demonstrating need for such waiver or reduction. Directs the Secretary, in making grants for graduate and undergraduate language and area centers and programs, to take into account the degree to which activities of centers, programs, and fellowships at IHEs advance national interests, generate and disseminate information, and foster debate on U.S. foreign policy from diverse perspectives. Extends through FY 2009 the authorization of appropriations for part A. (Sec. 3) Revises and reauthorizes business and international education programs (title VI part B). Includes, among the entities to be involved in collaborative activities with centers for international business education (IBE), IHEs eligible for assistance under IIIAB or V. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce the required non-Federal share for IHE grantees under part B IBE centers or education and training programs, if they are eligible for IIIAB or V assistance and submit grant applications demonstrating need for such waiver or reduction. Extends through FY 2009 the authorization of appropriations for part B: (1) IBE centers; and (2) education and training programs. (Sec. 4) Revises and reauthorizes the Institute for International Public Policy (title VI part C). Includes (in addition to the currently specified Historically Black IHEs and other IHEs serving substantial numbers of underrepresented students) specific references to Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Hispanic-serving IHEs in provisions for the Institute's programs for: (1) increasing participation of underrepresented populations as professionals in international service (including private international voluntary service and the U.S. Foreign Service); (2) junior year study abroad; and (3) internships. Authorizes the Secretary to waive or reduce the required non-Federal share for IHE grantees in the Institute's professional international service program if they are eligible for IIIAB or V assistance and submit grant applications demonstrating need for such waiver or reduction. Allows Institute grants for minority institutional development to be used to promote collaboration with other IHEs that receive title VI funds. Replaces the current Institute program of study and fellowships for a masters degree in international relations with a program of study and fellowships for an advanced degree in international relations, international affairs, international economics, or other academic areas related to the Institute fellow's career objectives. Requires such advanced degree study program to be designed by the eligible grant recipient consortia, consistent with the fellow's career objectives. Eliminates authority for an Interagency Committee on Minority Careers in International Affairs. Names students in part C undergraduate and postbaccalaureate internship programs as Ralph J. Bunche Fellows. Extends through FY 2009 the authorization of appropriations for part C. (Sec. 5) Revises title VI part D general provisions to authorize the Secretary to use up to one percent of title VI funds for evaluation, outreach, and dissemination. (Sec. 6) Establishes an independent International Education Advisory Board to advise Congress and the Secretary on title VI programs in relation to national needs with respect to homeland security, international education, international affairs, and foreign language training. (Sec. 7) Sets forth requirements relating to: (1) Federal Government agency recruiter access to students and student recruiting information; and (2) safety in programs of student travel and study abroad. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on foreign language heritage communities of U.S. residents or citizens, particularly those that include speakers of languages critical to U.S. national security.</summary>
