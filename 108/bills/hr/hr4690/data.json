Requires the exchange to be consummated on an equal value basis, except that the Secretary and MountainStar may agree to equalize the agreed-upon values of the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in the exchange through the inclusion of monetary consideration, provided that any adjustment agreed does not exceed 25 percent of the value of the Federal lands to be conveyed."
