Prohibits Federal agencies or commissions from promoting recession, stagnation, or unemployment to reduce wages or inflation.Directs the President to establish a full employment framework for the annual budget submitted to the Congress that meets specified goals for: (1) quality of life and environment; (2) responsible, sustainable growth; (3) unemployment reduction; and (4) human rights.Requires the Joint Economic Committee to oversee actions under this Act and submit an annual Concurrent Resolution on Economic Policy setting forth its proposed employment goals."
