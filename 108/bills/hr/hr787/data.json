Requires the Secretary to implement programs to monitor and correct instances of failure of surveyors to do so.Declares that nothing shall be construed as precluding members of survey teams from providing information to faculty and staff on best or innovative practices for assuring quality care in nursing facilities.Requires the Secretary to provide incentives for operators with histories of good compliance to acquire facilities with poor compliance histories.Permits nursing facilities to appeal deficiency determinations.Requires the Secretary to establish a program that rewards skilled nursing facilities that provide the highest quality of care."
