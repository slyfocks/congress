  <summary>10/2/2003--Introduced.
National Preparedness Standards Act - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish clearly defined standards and guidelines for Federal, State, and local government emergency preparedness and response capability, including standards and guidelines for training, interoperable communication systems, and response equipment. Requires such standards to be: (1) sufficiently flexible to allow local government officials to set priorities based on their needs, while reaching nationally-determined preparedness levels within a fixed time period; and (2) measurable and subject to Federal audit. Directs the Secretary to: (1) determine minimum essential emergency preparedness and response capabilities for each State; (2) measure the progress of each State in achieving such capabilities and in complying with standards issued by the Secretary; and (3) include in the FY 2005 budget request for the Department of Homeland Security a separate minimum essential emergency preparedness and response capability standard for metropolitan areas and for rural areas with respect to weapons of mass destruction and terrorism-related disaster equipment and training.</summary>
