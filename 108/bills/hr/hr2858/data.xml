  <summary>7/24/2003--Introduced.
Material Support to Terrorism Prohibition Enhancement Act of 2003 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit (in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or while outside the United States and a U.S. national or a legal entity organized under U.S. laws) providing, or concealing or disguising the nature, location, source, or ownership of, material support or resources to be used in carrying out an act of international or domestic terrorism or in concealing or escaping from the commission of any such act. Defines (as components of "material support or resources") "training" to mean instruction or teaching designed to impart a specific skill and "personnel" to include oneself. Prohibits prosecuting a person in connection with providing "personnel" unless that person has knowingly provided, attempted to provide, or conspired to provide a terrorist organization with one or more individuals (who may be or include himself) to work in concert with the organization or under its direction or control.</summary>
