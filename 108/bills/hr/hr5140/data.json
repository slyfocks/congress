    "text": "Ammonium Nitrate Security Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to redefine explosives to include detonable nitrate fertilizers. Makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in detonable nitrate fertilizers materials without a license. Requires the Attorney General to promulgate regulations specifically related to the storage of such fertilizers. Modifies requirements for explosive material licenses and user permits to exempt an applicant from the fee for a license or user permit for detonable nitrate fertilizers. Excludes license or user permit applicant's employees who will be authorized to possess detonable nitrate fertilizers from the requirement that they be checked for convictions of certain felonies. Sets forth fines and penalties for violation of this Act."
