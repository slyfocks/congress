Directs that if the values of the lands to be exchanged are not equal, they shall be equalized either through a payment of money or, upon agreement, by a decrease in the amount of land conveyed. Prescribes that the values of the lands being exchanged shall be determined by a mutually agreed upon appraiser or appraisers following standards set forth in Federal appraisal standards publications, with the cost of such appraisals to be equally shared between the parties.Requires that as a condition of the conveyance, the recipients of the Utah land must obtain a conservation easement to protect the land's cultural and natural resources."
