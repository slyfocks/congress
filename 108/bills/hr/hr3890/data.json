Modifies the list of priorities that the Secretary of Energy must consider in reviewing research and development activities for possible inclusion in the Steel Initiative Research Plan by deleting the development of advanced coatings for sheet steels and including the development of: (1) advanced sheet and bar steels; and (2) technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Repeals provisions establishing an expanded steel and aluminum research program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Reestablishes a requirement for annual reports to Congress."
