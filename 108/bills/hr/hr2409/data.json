Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to include inpatient prices charged to disproportionate share (DSH) hospitals in the best price exemptions for the Medicaid drug rebate program. (Thus allows certain high-volume DSH safety net providers to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies and receive the lowest price they can get for inpatient drugs. Currently such entities are only able to receive discounts on the prices of outpatient drugs because of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services interpretation of the best price exemption under the Medicaid drug rebate program). Subjects such drugs purchased by high-volume DSH hospital safety net providers for inpatient use to specified auditing and recordkeeping requirements."
