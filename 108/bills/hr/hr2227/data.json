    "text": "Obesity Prevention Act - Amends the National School Lunch Act to direct the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of Education (ED), to award competitive grants to: (1) up to 20 State educational agencies for model nutrition education and physical fitness programs for elementary and secondary school students; and (2) up to 100 local educational agencies (LEAs), at least one per State, for pilot projects to promote healthy eating habits and increase the physical fitness of such students. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to encourage States to implement plans to carry out activities to assist obese children or children at risk of becoming obese. Requires a State, in order to receive such a grant, to: (1) have a State child health plan which provides satisfactorily for certain activities under the children health insurance program of the Social Security Act; and (2) agree to make available at least 15 percent in non-Federal matching funds. Establishes a Commission on Obesity Treatment and Prevention to oversee research, policy formation, and other activities of the Federal Government regarding the prevention and treatment of obesity. Directs the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Secretary of ED, to establish programs of: (1) President's Health and Fitness Awards for elementary and secondary schools; and (2) President's Health and Fitness Teacher Achievement Awards for teachers, coaches, or related personnel and the LEAs that employ them.. Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include nutrition and health education programs in authorized local activities of 21st century community learning centers' programs before- and after-school and during summer recess."
