E-911 Implementation Act of 2003 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to: (1) establish a joint program to facilitate coordination between Federal, State, and local emergency communications systems, emergency personnel, public safety organizations, telecommunications carriers, and telecommunications equipment manufacturers and vendors involved in the implementation of E-911 (enhanced emergency) services; (2) create an E-911 Implementation Coordination Office to implement such program; and (3) develop a management plan for such program. Requires annual reports from the Assistant Secretary and the Administrator to Congress on Office activities. Directs the Assistant Secretary and the Administrator to provide grants to eligible entities (States, local governments, tribal organizations) for the implementation of phase II E-911 services through planning, infrastructure improvements, telecommunications equipment purchases, and personnel training. Limits the Federal share of project costs to 50 percent. Outlines entity participation requirements. Requires each grant applicant to: (1) certify to the Assistant Secretary and the Administrator, at the time of application and annually thereafter if receiving such a grant, that no portion of designated E-911 charges (taxes or fees designated or presented to deliver or improve E-911 services) imposed by a State or other taxing jurisdiction is being obligated or expended for any other purpose; and (2) agree that if such charges are used for any other purpose, all of the grant funds shall be returned. Authorizes appropriations to the Department of Transportation for such grants. Terminates the grant program on October 1, 2008. Requires a report from the Federal Communications Commission to specified congressional committees on the deployment of E-911 Phase II services by Tier III service providers.</summary>
