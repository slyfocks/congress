Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to deem any agreement or action on behalf of a foreign person or a business concern which is prohibited under the Federal criminal code to be U.S. export assistance prohibited under such Act. (Currently, U.S. assistance and financing is prohibited for exports to Cuba or for commercial exports to Iran, Libya, North Korea, or Sudan.) Expresses the sense of Congress that any Member of Congress who violates the Federal criminal code should be sanctioned under the appropriate congressional rule."
