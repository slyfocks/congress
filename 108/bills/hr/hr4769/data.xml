  <summary>7/7/2004--Introduced.
No Child Left Behind Appropriations Support Act of 2004 - Makes a supplemental appropriation for the Department of Education for FY 2004 to carry out this Act. Directs the Secretary of Education to make payments in additional amounts to each local education agency (LEA) that receives a lesser amount of funds for FY 2004 than it received for FY 2003 under subpart 2 (Allocations) of part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) of title I (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Requires such payments to equal the difference between the amount the LEA would otherwise receive for FY 2004 and the amount the LEA received in FY 2003.</summary>
