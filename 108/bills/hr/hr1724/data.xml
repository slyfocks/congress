  <summary>4/10/2003--Introduced.
Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to require institutions of higher education that participate in HEA title IV student assistance programs to grant military leaves of absence, and provide refunds of or credits for tuition and fees paid, to individuals who are unable to complete a period of instruction or receive academic credit because they were called to serve on active duty in the Armed Forces, or to perform qualifying National Guard duty, during a war or other military operation or national emergency.Requires the leave of absence to be for the period of active duty or service and for one year after completion of such duty or service. Requires the refund or credit to be prorated to cover the period when the student had to leave. Provides that such leave of absence shall not be treated as a withdrawal for certain student assistance purposes.</summary>
