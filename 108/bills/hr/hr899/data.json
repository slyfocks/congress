    "text": "Handgun Licensing Act of 2003 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the Act) to prohibit the transfer of a handgun or handgun ammunition to an individual not licensed to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition, unless: (1) the transferor (or a licensed dealer under State law) has examined a valid handgun license issued to the individual by the State in which the transaction takes place and an additional valid photograph identification document and has contacted and has been informed by the chief law enforcement officer of the State that the handgun license has not been revoked; and (2) three business days have elapsed from the date on which the transferor received such information, or the individual has presented to the transferor a written document, issued not less than ten days earlier by the appropriate officer, stating that the transferee requires access to a handgun because of a threat to the life of the transferee or any member of the transferee's household.Prohibits an unlicenced individual from receiving a handgun or handgun ammunition without possessing a valid handgun license issued to the individual by the State in which the transaction takes place.Sets forth State law requirements, definitions of \"handgun license\" and \"handgun ammunition,\" and penalties for violations of this Act.Directs the Attorney General to make a grant to each State to cover the initial startup costs associated with establishing a licensing system.Requires an applicant for a license to certify that the business is covered by an insurance policy which provides personal injury protection, to a limit of $100,000, to any person who, while engaged in lawful activity, suffers bodily injury or death through the use of a handgun obtained as a result of the applicant's negligence."
