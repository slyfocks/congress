  <summary>5/22/2003--Introduced.
Public Employer's Restitution Act of 2003 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code to allow alienation of an individual's benefits under certain pension plans in order to satisfy, in part or whole, court judgments, decrees, or orders requiring restitution for embezzlement of State or local government funds (qualified embezzlement restitution orders). Gives priority, before payment of such benefits to a State or local government under such an order, to their payment to any other aggrieved State or local government under a previously determined qualified: (1) embezzlement restitution order; or (2) domestic relations order that has such government as an alternate payee.</summary>
