Declares, under certain conditions, that holders of mining claims executed under this Act have the exclusive right of possession and use of the claimed land for mineral activities. Subjects existing and/or future unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites, with specified exceptions, to an annual claim maintenance fee payable to the Secretary of the Interior in lieu of the assessment work requirement contained in the general mining laws and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.Exempts from the mandated fee any claimants holding ten or fewer mining claims who elect to perform the assessment work.Requires locators of unpatented mining claims, mill sites, and tunnel sites located after this Act's enactment to pay a location fee. Establishes penalties against holders of mining claims for noncompliance with this Act. Requires: (1) a permit, with exceptions, to engage in mineral activities on Federal land that may cause a disturbance of surface resources; (2) an operations permit to carry out any activity greater than casual use; (3) denial of permits to persons who are in violation of this Act; and (4) operation and reclamation standards. Establishes the Abandoned Locatable Minerals Mine Reclamation Fund in the Treasury.Amends the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 and the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 to revise the Secretary of Agriculture's responsibilities within the scope of this Act.Requires the Secretaries of the Interior and of Agriculture to establish and collect user fees from persons subject to this Act's requirements.Repeals the Building Stone Act and the Saline Placer Act.
