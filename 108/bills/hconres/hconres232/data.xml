  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) grave concerns exist concerning the deployment by the People's Republic of China of hundreds of ballistic missiles directed toward Taiwan which threaten the security and stability in the Taiwan Strait; (2) the President should direct U.S. officials to raise these concerns with the appropriate Chinese officials, and should seek a renunciation from the Chinese leaders of any threat or use of force against Taiwan; (3) the President should affirm to the Chinese leaders that there will not be a quid pro quo between the dismantling of missiles aimed at Taiwan by China, and arms sales to Taiwan by the United States; (4) China should dismantle the missiles that threaten Taiwan, otherwise the President should authorize the sale of the Aegis system to Taiwan in order that it may defend itself against the threat of a missile attack by China; and (5) the future of Taiwan should be determined peacefully and with the express consent of the Taiwanese people.</summary>
