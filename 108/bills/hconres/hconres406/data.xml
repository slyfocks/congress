  <summary>4/2/2004--Introduced.
States that Congress: (1) remembers the victims of the 1994 Rwanda genocide and pledges to work to ensure that such an atrocity does not take place again; (2) acknowledges that the international community, including the United States, failed the people of Rwanda and watched with indifference while hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians were being killed; (3) supports assistance to the survivors of the Rwandan genocide; (4) urges political and financial support for the Gacaca courts; (5) acknowledges the heroic work of many individuals and human rights organizations for their campaign to help stop the genocide; (6) expresses deep appreciation to General Romeo Dallaire for his efforts to stop the genocide and for helping many Rwandese civilians; (7) accepts the fact that General Dallaire warned the United Nations on a number of occasions of an impending genocide and was ordered by his superiors not to take action; (8) calls for an investigation of the role played by the United States prior to and during the Rwandan genocide, noting that the parliaments of Belgium and France both created commissions of inquiry to investigate the roles played by their respective governments; and (9) urges the creation of a bi-partisan Commission of Inquiry for Rwanda to investigate all aspects of the role played by the United States prior to and during the Rwandan genocide.</summary>
