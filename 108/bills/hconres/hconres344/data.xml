  <summary>11/21/2003--Introduced.
Resolves that: (1) the President should take action, through the liquidation of blocked Iraqi assets or other appropriate sources, to ensure that prisoners of war (POWs) during the 1991 Gulf War, and their immediate family members, receive without delay just compensation for their suffering as awarded by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; and (2) Congress will continue to oversee provisions of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003 to ensure that it is not misinterpreted, including by divesting U.S. courts of jurisdiction, with respect to the POWs and other victims of Iraqi terrorism.</summary>
