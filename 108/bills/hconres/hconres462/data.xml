  <summary>7/15/2004--Passed House without amendment.
States that: (1) Congress reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act as the cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations; (2) the military modernization and weapons procurement program of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is a matter of grave concern, particularly the missile deployment directed toward Taiwan; (3) the President should direct U.S. officials to raise these military concerns with PRC officials; (4) the President and Congress should determine whether the escalating arms buildup, including deployment of offensive weaponry and missiles in areas adjacent to the Taiwan Strait, requires that additional defense articles and services be made available to Taiwan, and the United States should encourage Taiwan to devote sufficient financial resources to its defense; (5) as recommended by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the Department of Defense should provide the appropriate congressional committees with a comprehensive report on Russian military sales to the PRC; (6) the President should encourage further dialogue between Taiwan and the PRC; and (7) the United States should not discourage Taiwan officials from visiting the United States on the basis that doing so would violate the "one China policy."</summary>
