  <summary>7/14/2004--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the conditions and techniques of training of U.S. military personnel are not inhumane; (2) persons detained in the Global War on Terrorism are not entitled to privileges or treatment superior to those afforded U.S. military personnel during training; (3) terrorists are a mortal enemy of the United States and all civilized nations; (4) the United States must continue to pursue individuals who violate the laws, orders, and policies requiring humane treatment of persons detained in the Global War on Terrorism and ensure that such violations do not occur in the future; (5) all world governments should seek to eliminate terrorism; (6) the U.S. Government should continue to develop and apply processes to determine whether persons it detains are lawful or unlawful combatants and whether they continue to constitute a terrorist threat; (7) the apprehension, detention, and interrogation of terrorists are fundamental elements in the successful prosecution of the Global War on Terrorism and the protection of U.S. citizens' lives; and (8) the overriding national priority in the Global War on Terrorism must be to win the war with the least loss of innocent life.</summary>
