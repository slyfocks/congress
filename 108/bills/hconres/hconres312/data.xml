  <summary>10/28/2003--Introduced.
Recognizes the contributions of over three-quarters of a million part-time and adjunct faculty, full-time non-tenure-track faculty, and graduate employees who teach in colleges and universities across the United States. Supports: (1) the efforts of organizations to raise public awareness of the conditions in which these contingent employees work; and (2) solutions which provide fair and equitable treatment for contingent employees in higher education and promote the return to a significant and stable corps of full-time, tenure-track faculty in U.S. institutions of higher education.</summary>
