  <summary>3/18/2004--Introduced.
States that Congress: (1) condemns the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution ES-10/14 (December 8, 2003) which requests the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to render an advisory opinion concerning the international legal consequences arising from Israel's construction of a security fence in parts of the West Bank; (2) deplores the use of the International Court of Justice by the United Nations General Assembly for political purposes that only do harm to the credibility of the General Assembly and the Court, and threaten to impede international and United States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; (3) commends the Administration for its leadership in opposing the manipulation of the International Court of Justice into a political forum for denunciation of Israel and its legitimate self-defense; (4) expresses the continued commitment of the United States to Israel's right to exist as a Jewish democratic state, its security and its right of self-defense, including the right to build a security fence as a direct consequence of more than three years of Palestinian terrorism; (5) condemns the ongoing failure of the Palestinian leadership to take action to cease all violence and terrorism against Israel and to instead pursue misguided political alternatives to the Performance-Based Roadmap to a Permanent Two-State Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, democratic reform, and direct peace negotiations; and (6) reiterates support for the President's June 2002 speech setting out the conditions necessary for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for the achievement of a negotiated two-state solution based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and 1397 (2002) calling for the exchange of territory for peace, direct negotiations between the parties, and the immediate cessation of all violence.</summary>
