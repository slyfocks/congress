  <summary>6/24/2004--Introduced.
Commends the efforts of women and civil society in the Republic of Colombia to mitigate violence in their communities, advocate for a negotiated solution to conflict, and develop a common agenda for peace. Reaffirms the importance of including the expertise, knowledge, and experiences of Columbian women in peace dialogues, negotiations, and decisionmaking roles. Supports the protection of women and their organizations and the defense of fundamental human rights in Columbia. Calls on the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and other appropriate Federal agencies to: (1) integrate a gender perspective in U.S. policies, programs, and activities regarding the situation in Columbia; and (2) support the efforts by Columbian women to promote peace, respect for human rights, and an end to conflict and violence in Columbia.</summary>
