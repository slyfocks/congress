  <summary>7/25/2003--Introduced.
Acknowledges the finding of the European Court of Human Rights in which it criticized the investigation of the murder of attorney Pat Finucane in 1989 in Northern Ireland for not addressing the possibility of collusion by partisan paramilitary forces. Applauds the interest of the European Court of Human Rights in determining the full circumstances behind the murder of Pat Finucane. Recognizes the importance of resolving this matter as soon as possible in order to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. Encourages the Government of the United Kingdom to appoint an independent judicial body to conduct a full and impartial inquiry into this matter and to promptly prosecute those individuals responsible for having committed this crime.</summary>
