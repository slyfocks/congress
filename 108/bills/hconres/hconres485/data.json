Extends the thanks of Congress and the Nation to DPMO and JPAC personnel and to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for their efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting of Americans who remain unaccounted for as a result of the Vietnam War. Recognizes and honors eight Americans and nine Vietnamese who paid the ultimate price in supporting that full accountability mission. Thanks Vietnam for continued assistance and cooperation in the humane recovery, identification, and repatriation of the remains of American personnel remaining unaccounted for from the Vietnam era. Recognizes that the efforts and involvement of POW/MIA families contribute significantly to the success of the JPAC."
