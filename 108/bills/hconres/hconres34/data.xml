  <summary>10/5/2004--Passed House amended.
Commends Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson for urging private health insurance companies to encourage Americans to lead active lifestyles. Expresses the sense of Congress that private health insurance companies should: (1) do more to encourage Americans to lead healthier and more active lifestyles; (2) provide discounted premiums to those who exercise regularly; and (3) encourage frequent screening for diseases that are easily treatable in their early stages. Applauds private health insurance companies that are already taking such actions.</summary>
