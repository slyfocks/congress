  <summary>1/8/2003--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) negotiate a new base rights agreement with the Government of Panama to permit stationing U.S. forces in Panama and to ensure that the Panama Canal remains open, secure, and neutral; and (2) ensure that U.S. military facilities which could be utilized for stationing such forces are fully maintained and secured if the Government of Panama is willing to enter into good faith negotiations for a continued U.S. military presence in Panama.</summary>
