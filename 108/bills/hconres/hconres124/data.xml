  <summary>3/27/2003--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. Government should act carefully with regard to issues involving semiconductor trade between the United States and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) to assure that trade disputes do not create geopolitical or economic tensions between the two countries, and do not result in the loss of highly skilled jobs in the United States, including jobs at U.S. facilities of Korean semiconductor manufacturers; (2) the Secretary of Commerce should review the financial restructuring of Hynix Semiconductor Inc. in light of economic reforms which have taken place in South Korea and avoid taking any action that will threaten the jobs of American workers in the semiconductor industry or threaten future investment in Hynix Semiconductor Inc.'s facility in Eugene, Oregon; and (3) the U.S. Trade Representative should seek to address issues involving semiconductor trade between the two countries through consultation after full review of the facts.</summary>
