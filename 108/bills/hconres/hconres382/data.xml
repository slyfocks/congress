  <summary>3/11/2004--Introduced.
Expresses that: (1) in passing the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, Congress demonstrated its clear intent to allow hunting and fishing on public lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System (the System); (2) the intent of Congress has not changed in any way since such Act was enacted, and any assumptions to the contrary are misguided and misinterpret the clear intent of Congress; and (3) the general purpose of reserving certain lands as public lands, including lands within the System, is to make them available to the public for reasonable uses, which include hunting, fishing, other wildlife-dependent sports, and other outdoor purposes.</summary>
