  <summary>9/13/2004--Passed House amended.
Declares that Congress condemns the consistent pattern of gross human rights violations by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. Calls on the international community to adopt a resolution at the upcoming 60th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights which details the dismal human rights record of Syria. Expresses its support for the Syrian people in their struggle for freedom, respect for human rights and civil liberties, democratic self-governance, and the establishment of the rule of law. Encourages the President and the Secretary of State to assist dissidents, human rights activists, and the nonviolent pro-democracy opposition in Syria. Urges the adoption and pursuit of these and other policies to seek a democratic government in Syria that will: (1) bring freedom to the Syrian people; (2) cease the illegal Syrian occupation of the Lebanese Republic; (3) abandon Syrian support for terrorism; (4) not pursue development or transfer of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, and permit international observers to verify such assurances; and (5) live in peace and security with the international community.</summary>
