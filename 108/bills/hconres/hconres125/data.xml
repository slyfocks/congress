  <summary>3/27/2003--Introduced.
Condemns the recent arrests and other intimidation tactics against democracy activists by the Castro regime.Calls on the Cuban Government to release immediately those imprisoned and held during this most recent crackdown for activities the government wrongly deems "subversive, counter-revolutionary, and provocative."Reaffirms Senate Resolution 272, 107th Congress, agreed to June 10, 2002, which was agreed to without opposition and which called for, among other things, amnesty for all political prisoners.Praises the bravery of those Cubans who, because they practiced free speech and signed the Varela Project petition, have been targeted in this most recent government crackdown.Urges the President to demand the immediate release of these prisoners and to take all appropriate steps to secure their immediate release.</summary>
