  <summary>6/26/2003--Introduced.
Urges the U.S. Government to: (1) increase its support for the efforts to promote local Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian community cooperation on water issues in order to improve access to this vital resource, protect this scarce resource from pollution, rehabilitate the River Jordan and the Dead Sea, and in the process advance peace in the Middle East and stimulate tourism and employment in the region; and (2) take the lead in investigating the viability of and supporting regional water projects such as the "Red Sea to Dead Sea" project and desalination projects and other water and sanitation projects which would make accessible large quantities of water to Jordanians, Israelis, and Palestinians and save the Dead Sea, and in the process advance peace in the Middle East and stimulate tourism and employment in the region.</summary>
