(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced on May 7, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) all people throughout the Nation should talk to family and friends about the importance of wearing safety belts; (2) law enforcement agencies should be commended for their commitment to enforce safety belt usage laws; (3) national and community agencies and organizations should be recognized for promoting awareness about Buckle Up America Week (May 19 through 26); (4) all legislative leaders should participate in Buckle Up America events; and (5) drivers and passengers should insist their fellow automobile passengers wear their safety belts while driving and that all children in the car are buckled up in the appropriate restraint for their age, height, and weight.</summary>
