  <summary>7/24/2003--Introduced.
Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) the U.S. military should not become involved in the Liberian civil war, either alone or as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force; and (2) a regional effort, especially including the countries neighboring Liberia, would be the most effective way to end the tragic conflict in Liberia and such effort should be encouraged.</summary>
