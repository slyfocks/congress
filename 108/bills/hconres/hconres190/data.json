Requires: (1) a majority vote of the members from each House before a recommendation by the committee can be made; and (2) any recommendation with respect to the rules and procedures of one House that only affects matters related solely to that House to only be made and voted on by members of that House and upon its adoption by a majority of such members, to be considered to have been adopted by the full committee as a recommendation of the joint committee. Requires an interim report to the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate by January 31, 2004, and a final report by May 31, 2004, of the results of such study and review.Terminates the committee by May 31, 2004."
