  <summary>6/19/2003--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the illegal importation of prescription drugs severely undermines the regulatory protections afforded to United States consumers; (2) the President should take action to prevent the illegal importation of prescription drugs from Canada or any other foreign country; (3) the United States Trade Representative should take action to correct the inequities and discrimination caused by Canada's Patented Medicine Pricing Review Board; (4) the pharmaceutical industry and the health care community should work with United States consumers to lower the price of prescription drugs and should mount a nationwide educational awareness program regarding the dangers of imported drugs and medicines; and (5) Congress should enact a Medicare drug benefit as the best and safest way for United States patients to obtain their prescription drugs.</summary>
