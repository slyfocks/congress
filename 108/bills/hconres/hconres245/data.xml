  <summary>7/16/2003--Introduced.
Declares the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the U.S. national security interest to remain engaged in Iraq in order to ensure a peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative government; (2) the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other appropriate international and nongovernmental organizations should provide assistance to the Coalition in Iraq in order to contribute to international security and stability, general and complete disarmament, and global economic development; (3) the President should consider requesting formally and expeditiously that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) raise a force for deployment in post-war Iraq similar to what it has done in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo, and should urge NATO allies and other countries to provide troops and police to Coalition efforts in Iraq; and (4) the President should consider calling on the United Nations to urge its member states to provide military forces and civilian police to promote stability and security in Iraq and resources to help rebuild and administer Iraq.</summary>
