    "text": "Conflict Diamonds Resolution - Urges the global diamond industry, as represented by the World Diamond Council, to: (1) establish a fund that supports demobilization centers and rehabilitation training programs for excombatants in the civil wars in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly child soldiers, provides health care treatment, education, training, and other needs of women and girls victimized in those wars by rape, forced domestic servitude, and other gender-related abuses, helps strengthen governmental and nongovernmental health care infrastructure to support HIV/AIDS programs in such countries, supports economic development and civil society-building programs in those countries, and supports diamond training in the latest technologies to African workers; (2) establish a program through which humanitarian assistance from the diamond industry can be made available to the amputees of, and others permanently disabled by, the civil wars in such countries; (3) continue deliberations with the United Nations, governments, charitable organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in the Kimberly Process to develop a diamond certification system for rough diamonds to stem the trade in conflict diamonds; and (4) support the activities of all reconciliation processes (including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Sierra Leone) that will play a critical role in healing the wounds of war and promoting a lasting peace in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Urges the Secretary of State to assist the World Diamond Council in establishing and administering the fund, and to report to the appropriate congressional committees on progress made by the Council toward addressing the goals and objectives of this Act."
