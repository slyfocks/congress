  <summary>4/1/2003--Introduced.
Condemns: (1) the Syrian Government's actions in transferring military equipment to the terrorist government of Iraq at a time when coalition forces are fighting to liberate the Iraqi people, and demands that such transfers cease immediately; (2) Syria's policy of allowing terrorists to cross its border to fight for the regime of Saddam Hussein; and (3) the failure of the Russian Federation to intercede and prevent Russian private entities from engaging in the sale of lethal military weapons and other military goods to the terrorist government of Iraq. Demands that Syria and all other states bordering Iraq prevent the crossing into Iraq of Iraqi or non-Iraqi individuals or groups who intend to fight in support of the regime of Saddam Hussein and the emigration from Iraq of Iraqi soldiers or officials affiliated with such regime. Declares that any state that continues to assist the Saddam Hussein regime will be seen by the U.S. people as opposing the vital interests of the United States and that there should be the most severe consequences for the future relations between the United States and such state.</summary>
