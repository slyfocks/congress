  <summary>6/17/2004--Introduced.
Reaffirms the policies and principles of the McCarran Amendment (which waived the sovereign immunity of the United States so that it could be joined in comprehensive State general adjudications of the rights to use water) that have been recognized by Supreme Court decisions. Recognizes that, as a matter of practice, the United States should adhere and defer to State water law. Commends Western States that maintain comprehensive systems for the quantification of rights to use water for all beneficial purposes.</summary>
