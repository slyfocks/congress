  <summary>5/4/2004--Passed House amended.
Declares the sense of Congress that music education grounded in rigorous instruction is an important component of a well-rounded academic curriculum and should be available to every student in every school. Recognizes the International Music Products Association (also known as NAMM) for its efforts to designate a Music in Our Schools Month in order to highlight the important role that school music programs play in the academic and social development of children.</summary>
