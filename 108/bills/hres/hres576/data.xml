  <summary>7/14/2004--Passed House amended.
Commends the Government of the People's Republic of China (China) for its steps to improve its legal framework for intellectual property (IP) rights protection and efforts toward compliance with international standards for IP rights. Recognizes the Chinese Government's renewed commitment to significantly reduce IP infringement levels. Recognizes, despite such steps, the continued existence of widespread IP rights violations in China. Urges the Chinese Government to undertake a coordinated nationwide IP rights enforcement campaign and related actions. Recommends that China implement a legal framework and effective enforcement mechanisms that would protect the IP rights not only of the United States and other foreign business enterprises, but also of Chinese IP rights holders. Urges the Chinese Government to give greater market access to the foreign producers of legitimate products such as film and other audiovisual products in order to reduce demand for and prevalence of pirated and counterfeit goods. Calls for continued close monitoring of China's action plan on IP protection presented during the 2004 United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, and to work with the Administration to further encourage China's efforts to bring its framework of laws, regulations, and implementing rules into compliance with international law and to create and maintain IP rights enforcement mechanisms capable of deterring counterfeiting and piracy activities.</summary>
