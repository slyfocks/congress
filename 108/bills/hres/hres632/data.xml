  <summary>5/6/2004--Introduced.
States that the House of Representatives calls on the Government of Romania to: (1) provide prompt and equitable restitution to the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Unitarian Church, the Hungarian Reformed Church, the Jewish community, and other affected religious communities for property confiscated under the former Communist government of Romania, including agricultural and forestry lands; (2) respect such churches' and communities' constitutional rights of existence and practice; (3) stop the demolition and dismemberment of Greek Catholic churches and immediately ensure the security of all Greek Catholic churches and other buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries; and (4) repeal Law-Decree NR. 126/1990, as the transfer of juridical duties of a state to a mixed ecclesiastic committee has proven ineffectual and seriously hampers the ability of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church to seek redress, and to allow the claims submitted to be heard by an independent, nonreligious commission.</summary>
