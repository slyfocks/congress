  <summary>6/26/2003--Passed House without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Condemns any restriction of the freedom of thought, expression, or association in Hong Kong, consistent with the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.Recognizes that because Hong Kong exercises considerable influence in international affairs, as a developed economy, financial center, trading entrepot and shipping center, reductions in the existing freedom of the Hong Kong people would be of global significance.Urges the Hong Kong Government and the People's Republic of China to withdraw the proposed implementation of Article 23 of the Basic Law insofar as it would reduce the basic human freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.Calls upon the People's Republic of China, the National People's Congress, and any other groups appointed by the Government of China to leave all revisions of Hong Kong law to a legislature elected by universal suffrage.Urges immediate elections for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong according to rules approved by the Hong Kong people through an election-law convention, referendum, or both.Calls upon the Government of China to fully respect the autonomy and independence of the chief executive, the civil service, the judiciary, the police of Hong Kong, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.Calls upon the U.S. Government, other governments, the people of the United States, and the people of the world to support freedom in Hong Kong by: (1) making clear statements against any limitations on existing human freedoms in Hong Kong; and (2) transmitting those statements to the people and the Government of the People's Republic of China.</summary>
