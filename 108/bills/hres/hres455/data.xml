  <summary>11/19/2003--Introduced.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, in coordination with the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development, should establish a program to foster private assistance by the people of the United States to Iraqi schools and hospitals through adopt-a-school and adopt-a-hospital initiatives. Calls for: (1) mechanisms to establish inventories of specific material and financial educational and medical needs which are made known to schools, education professionals, students, hospitals, and health care professionals in the United States; and (2) avenues for the donation, collection, and transfer of supplies and funds directly to Iraqi schools and hospitals. Calls for online peer-to-peer consultation between education and health care professionals in Iraq and the United States, as well as student-to-student communication.</summary>
