  <summary>3/3/2004--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the United State should continue to insist that the People's Republic of China adhere to fundamental human rights principles and allow its citizens full enjoyment of those rights. Declares that Congress urges the People's Republic of China to: (1) stop the persecution of all religious practitioners and safeguard fundamental human rights; (2) stop the forced return of North Korean refugees; (3) end its one-child per family policy and ensure that no government officials subject women to forced abortions or sterilizations; (4) hold an open investigation into the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, release all prisoners held in connection with that event, and pay compensation to the families who lost their loved ones; (5) release from detention all prisoners of conscience, persons held because of their religious activities, and persons of humanitarian concern; (6) release the 11th Panchen Lama; (7) adhere to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the 1951 Convention Relating to Refugees and its 1967 Protocol; and (8) allow visits to China by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Religious Intolerance and Torture, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</summary>
