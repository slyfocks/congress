  <summary>5/5/2004--Passed House amended.
Supports the goals and ideals of a National Autism Awareness Month. Recognizes and commends the parents and relatives of children with autism for their sacrifice and dedication in providing for the special needs of children with autism and for absorbing significant financial costs for specialized education and support services. Supports aggressive research to: (1) determine causes of autism; (2) identify the best methods of early intervention and treatment; (3) expand programs for individuals with autism across their lifespan; and (4) promote understanding of the special needs of individuals with autism. Commends the Department of Health and Human Services for implementing programs to study the epidemiology of autism and related disorders and advancing autism research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. Stresses the need to begin early intervention services soon after an individual has been diagnosed with autism, noting that early intervention strategies are the primary therapeutic options for individuals with autism and early intervention significantly improves outcomes for individuals with autism and can reduce the level of funding and services needed later in life. Supports the Federal Government's commitment to provide States with part of the costs needed to educate children with disabilities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Encourages more Americans to pursue the teaching profession and to be trained with the skills necessary to teach, assist, and respond to special needs students, including those students with autism. Recognizes the importance of worker training programs that meet the needs of developmentally disabled individuals, including those individuals with autism. Notes that people with autism can be, and are, productive members of the workforce if they are given appropriate support, training, and early intervention services.</summary>
