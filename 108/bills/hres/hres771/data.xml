  <summary>9/14/2004--Introduced.
Recognizes that National POW/MIA Recognition Day is one of the six days specified by law as a day on which the POW/MIA flag is to be flown over specified Federal facilities and national cemeteries, military installations, and post offices. Extends the gratitude of the House of Representatives and the Nation to those who have served their nation in captivity to hostile forces as prisoners of war. Recognizes and honors the more than 88,000 members of the U.S. Armed Forces who remain unaccounted for and their families. Recognizes the untiring efforts of national POW/MIA organizations to ensuring that America never forgets the contribution of the Nation's prisoners of war and unaccounted for military personnel.</summary>
