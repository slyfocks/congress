  <summary>9/10/2003--Passed House without amendment.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the visit of the Dalai Lama to the United States in September 2003 is warmly welcomed; (2) the Dalai Lama should be recognized and congratulated for his consistent efforts to promote dialogue to peacefully resolve the Tibet issue and to increase the religious and cultural autonomy of the Tibetan people; and (3) all parties to the current discussions should be encouraged by the Government of the United States to deepen these contacts in order to achieve the aspirations of the people of Tibet for genuine autonomy and basic human rights.</summary>
