Repeals the exception to such prohibition for a resolution proposing only to waive the requirement of rule XII concerning the availability of conference reports. (Thus applies such prohibition to such resolutions.)Amends rule XXII to make it out of order to consider a conference report to accompany a bill or joint resolution making or continuing appropriations unless: (1) the joint explanatory statement of the managers includes a separate part that clearly sets forth each item of appropriation added by the committee of conference to fund a new program, project, or activity and the program, project, or activity to which it relates; or (2) the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations causes such matter to be printed in the Congressional Record before consideration of the conference report."
