States that the House of Representatives: (1) expresses its sympathies for those Libyan children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its condolences to the families of those children who have died from the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); (2) raises concerns regarding the investigations and trial and the lack of compelling evidence regarding the allegations of criminal intent on the part of the Bulgarian medical workers; (3) expresses its dismay over the recent verdict by the Libyan court and the harsh sentence imposed on such workers and urges the Government of Libya to consider the possibility of withdrawing the charges and releasing the defendants; and (4) affirms U.S. support for the Government of Bulgaria and its efforts to resolve this matter.</summary>
