  <summary>7/15/2004--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the President should direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (UN) to seek an immediate end to the inequality experienced by Israel in the United Nations; (2) U.S. interests would be well served if Israel were afforded the benefits of full membership in the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) at the United Nations so that it could fully participate in the UN system; (3) the Secretary of State and other appropriate U.S. officials should pursue diplomatic efforts and should take all necessary steps to ensure the extension and upgrade of Israel's WEOG membership; and (4) the Secretary should report to Congress on a regular basis respecting actions taken to effect Israel's full WEOG membership and member states' responses to such efforts.</summary>
