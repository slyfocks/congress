  <summary>2/13/2003--Introduced.
Calls upon: (1) the executive branch of the U.S. Government and the international community to intervene immediately in the conflict in Burma and to protect and assist the refugees along the Thai-Burma border and the internally displaced persons within Burma; (2) the Government of Thailand to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to establish a permanent presence to assist the refugees; (3) the international community to place human rights monitors and peacekeepers inside Burma immediately in order to end the ethnic cleansing campaign of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) and to prosecute the military dictatorship of Burma on charges of genocide and as perpetrators of grave crimes against humanity; (4) the SPDC to allow the establishment of the democratically elected Government of Burma from the 1990 election led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy and to release unconditionally all political prisoners, and make appropriate reparations to victims of rape and forced labor, in Burma; (5) the international community to destroy SPDC's military capability by eliminating its capacity to produce illicit drugs that supply the funds for it to procure arms and munitions to support its war against the Burmese people; and (6) the international community and people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds to join together with the Burmese people for the Global Day of Prayer for Burma.</summary>
