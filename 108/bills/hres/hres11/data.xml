  <summary>1/7/2003--Introduced.
Calls for the United States to: (1) work with the United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) to establish self-governance and democracy in Kosova in which human rights are respected as the first step toward sovereignty; (2) encourage Kosova leaders to build stable relations with their neighbors; (3) work to end assistance by Kosova residents to parties using violence to further separatist aims in the region; (4) recognize that a lack of progress in the resolution of Kosova's final status creates political and economic instability in Kosova and in Southeast Europe; (5) work with the UN, EU, and other organizations to facilitate an orderly transition to Kosova independence; and (6) provide its share of assistance to encourage development of democracy and a free market economic system in Kosova.</summary>
