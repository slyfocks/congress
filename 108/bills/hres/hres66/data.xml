  <summary>6/14/2004--Passed House without amendment.
Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) urges men to understand the level of responsibility fathering a child requires, especially in the encouragement of the moral, academic, and spiritual development of children; (2) encourages active involvement of fathers in the rearing and development of their children, including the devotion of time, energy, and resources to children, recognizing that they need not only material support, but even more importantly, a secure and nurturing family environment; (3) urges mothers to encourage fathers to play an active role in child-rearing; (4) commends the millions of fathers who serve as wonderful, caring parents for their children; (5) calls on fathers across the Nation to use Father's Day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's lives, to spend Father's Day with their children, and to express their love and support for their children; and (6) urges institutions and government entities at every level to promote public policies that encourage and support, and remove barriers to, responsible fatherhood.</summary>
