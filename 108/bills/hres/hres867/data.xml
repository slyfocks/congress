  <summary>11/20/2004--Introduced.
Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) expresses its firm support for the efforts of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to promote democracy around the world; (2) commends all Venezuelans who have peacefully exercised the political rights which are accorded to them under Venezuela's Constitution to resolve their differences by democratic means, and abhors all acts of political violence; (3) views charges filed against members of the Venezuelan civic organization known as Sumate of conspiring with NED to overthrow Venezuela's government as politically motivated; and (4) would welcome a decision by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela not to prosecute Venezuelan citizens, including citizens associated with Sumate, for activities that were protected under the laws and Constitution of Venezuela when those activities were carried out.</summary>
