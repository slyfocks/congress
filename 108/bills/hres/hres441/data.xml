  <summary>11/17/2003--Introduced.
Condemns as a deliberate interference with the right of the United States to protect its own markets against unfair trade practices the adverse report issued by the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement Appellate Body on the proceeding to determine whether U.S. imposition of import restrictions on certain steel products on March 5, 2002, was consistent with the Agreement on Safeguards described in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Strongly urges the President to: (1) repeal all exclusions to such import restrictions which benefit European Union (EU) steelmakers if the EU retaliates against the United States in the form of counter import restrictions; and (2) direct the United States Trade Representative to use the voice and vote of the United States at the WTO to ensure that immediate reforms are made to the dispute settlement process to increase its transparency and ensure that it does not unfairly restrict trade remedy laws, create new obligations, or undermine legitimate trade actions brought by the United States or other WTO member countries.</summary>
