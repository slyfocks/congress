  <summary>3/27/2003--Passed House without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced in the House on March 20, 2003. The summary of that version is repeated here.)Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should issue a proclamation: (1) designating a day for humility, prayer, and fasting for all people of the United States; and (2) calling on all people of the United States to observe the day as a time of prayer and fasting, seek guidance from God to achieve a greater understanding of our own failings and to learn how we can do better in our everyday activities, and gain resolve in meeting the challenges that confront our Nation.</summary>
