  <summary>3/31/2004--Passed House without amendment.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) compensation for civilian employees and members of the uniformed services of the United States must be sufficient to support critical efforts to recruit, retain, and reward quality people in Government service; and (2) to help achieve this objective, in FY 2005, compensation for civilian employees of the United States should be adjusted at the same time, and in the same proportion, as are rates of compensation for members of the uniformed services.</summary>
