  <summary>7/23/2003--Introduced.
Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) disapproves of the manner in which Representative Thomas summoned the U.S. Capitol Police to evict minority party members of the Committee on Ways and Means from the committee library, as well as the manner in which he conducted the markup of legislation in such Committee on July 18, 2003; (2) finds that the bill considered at that markup was not validly ordered reported to the House; and (3) calls for the police report to be placed in the Congressional Record.</summary>
