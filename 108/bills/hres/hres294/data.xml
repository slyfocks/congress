  <summary>6/25/2003--Passed House without amendment.
Condemns in the harshest terms the recent terrorist actions that victimized innocent Israelis. Expresses solidarity with the Israeli people as they respond to ongoing terrorist attacks, and sympathy to the families of innocent Israelis and Palestinians who have lost their lives.Commends the President of the United States for his vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.Affirms that this vision can be fully realized only once terrorism is defeated, so that a new state may be created based on rule of law and respect for human rights.Recognizes and respects Israel's right to fight terrorism and acknowledges Israel's fight against terrorism as part of the global war against terrorism.Calls on all states to cease recognition of and political and material support for any Palestinian and other terrorist groups.Calls on all states immediately to: (1) establish effective mechanisms to ensure that funding from private citizens cannot be directed to terrorist groups for any purpose whatsoever, including ostensible humanitarian purposes; (2) provide support to the Palestinian Authority in its effort to confront and fight terror; and (3) assist the Palestinian people in creating the institutions of a democratic state that will respect the rule of law and live in peace with its neighbors.</summary>
