    "text": "Recognizes librarians as key in educating citizens of all ages, unlocking the potential of students from various socioeconomic backgrounds, and expanding opportunities for all students and families. Supports the American Library Association's fight to equip libraries with up-to-date technology. Urges members of both parties to support dramatic increases in funding for libraries. Declares that: (1) libraries have an expanding role in providing information relating to prosperity, civic competence, homeland security, and peace; and (2) those who work in libraries should be compensated at a level comparable to their important role in the functioning of democracy."
