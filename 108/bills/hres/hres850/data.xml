  <summary>10/8/2004--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Federal Communications Commission should: (1) not take any action in a scheduled resolution vote on Broadband Over Power Line systems (BPL), or adopt only reactive measures for resolving cases of harmful interference to public safety systems potentially caused by BPL; (2) withhold vote action pending a complete radio wave analysis to determine the actual effect of BPL on public safety systems; and (3) allow extensive public review and comment on such analysis and its results, and a summary of such comments should be published before any BPL rules are finally adopted.</summary>
