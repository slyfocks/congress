  <summary>5/5/2004--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) all Americans should keep the victims of child abuse and neglect in their thoughts and prayers; (2) all Americans should seek to break the cycle of child abuse and neglect and to give victimized children hope for the future; and (3) the faith community, nonprofit organizations, and volunteers across America should recommit themselves and mobilize their resources to assist abused and neglected children. Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) supports the goals and ideas of the "Day of Hope" which were observed as part of Child Abuse Prevention Month; and (2) commends the individuals working on behalf of abused and neglected children throughout the United States.</summary>
