  <summary>7/16/2003--Passed House amended.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) slavery, under any circumstances, is an unconscionable practice; (2) the subjection inherent in slavery inevitably leads to other abuses, including torture and rape; (3) human rights abuses and slavery in Sudan remain a matter of the most profound concern; (4) the United States must condemn attempts to ignore or condone these outrages; (5) the United States must make clear to all members of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the refusal to condemn slavery in Sudan undermines any moral authority that the Commission might seek to exert in other areas; (6) the United States must work to re-classify Sudan as an "Item 9" country, requiring a Special Rapporteur at the Commission's next session to investigate and report on abuses (rather than change that status to a lesser level of concern); and (7) the United States should encourage the United Nations to consider reinstating sanctions against Sudan and urge the European Union, the African Union, and all others who express concern for human freedom and dignity to be engaged in activities that will convince Sudan to abolish slavery and respect human rights.</summary>
