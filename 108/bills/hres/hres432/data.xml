  <summary>11/4/2003--Introduced.
Declares the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) member states of the United Nations (UN) should meet their obligations to women as agreed to in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, including increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in conflict resolution and peace processes; and (2) the United States should fully implement international law relating to human rights that protects the rights of women and girls during and after conflicts. Urges U.S. representatives at the UN to call upon all parties to armed conflict to protect women and girls from gender-based violence. Requests the Secretary of State to study and report to Congress on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building, the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution, and progress on gender mainstreaming throughout peacekeeping missions.</summary>
