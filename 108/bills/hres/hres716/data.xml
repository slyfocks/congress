  <summary>7/14/2004--Introduced.
States that the House of Representatives encourages the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to continue to participate in a constitutional solution to the political crisis in Venezuela, and appeals to the Government, civil society, and political parties to adhere to the provisions of the Declaration Against Violence and for Peace and Democracy. Calls on: (1) the public security forces to respect human rights and due process; and (2) the media to be impartial conveyers of the news and to refrain from actions which might encourage violence. Appeals to the Government of Venezuela and to the democratic opposition to respect the rights of all citizens to freely organize and support political leaders and to conduct peaceful activities in support of human, political, and civil rights. Commends: (1) the National Electoral Council for carrying out the validation of signatures on recall petitions in a fair and expeditious manner; and (2) the Organization of American States, the Group of Friends of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States for Venezuela, and the Carter Center for their assistance. Calls on the Government of Venezuela and the democratic opposition to: (1) support a free and transparent recall referendum vote; and (2) avoid reprisals or harassment against employees of the state and private enterprises for exercising their right to identify with any political party. Underscores that the success of democracy in Venezuela is of profound importance to the United States and to the countries of the Western Hemisphere.</summary>
