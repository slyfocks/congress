Urges their presidents, faculty, and staff to continue their efforts to recruit, retain, and graduate students who might otherwise not pursue a post-secondary education.Requests the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the Nation and interested groups to demonstrate support for historically Black colleges and universities with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.</summary>
