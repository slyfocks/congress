  <summary>7/15/2004--Passed House amended.
States that the House of Representatives reaffirms its commitment to Israel's security and its support of Israel's right to self-defense. Condemns the Palestinian leadership for failing to: (1) carry out its responsibilities under the Roadmap and under other obligations it has assumed; and (2) fight terrorism, including by bringing an end to terrorist attacks directed at Israel. Calls on Palestinians and all states to fight terrorism so that progress can be made toward resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Deplores the July 8, 2004, advisory judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the misuse of the ICJ for the political purpose of advancing the Palestinian position on matters Palestinian authorities have said should be the subject of negotiations. Regrets the ICJ's advisory judgment which is likely to undermine its reputation and interfere with a resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Commends the President and the Secretary of State for their leadership in marshaling opposition to such misuse of the ICJ. Calls on members of the international community to reflect on: (1) the steps taken by the Government of Israel to mitigate the impact of the security barrier on Palestinians, including steps it has taken by order of its High Court of Justice; and (2) the damage that will be done to the ICJ, the United Nations, and to individual Israelis and Palestinians under color of the ICJ advisory judgment that interfere in the Roadmap process and impede efforts toward an Israeli-Palestinian negotiated settlement. Urges all nations to join the United States in international fora to prevent political exploitation of the ICJ's advisory judgment.</summary>
