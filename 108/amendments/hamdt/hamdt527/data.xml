  <description>An amendment printed in Part B of House Report 108-497 and considered as adopted pursuant to the provisions of H. Res. 645. The amendment clarifies that no broader change is intended generally with respect to a federal court's review over an agency's interpretation of regulations and the "deference" given that agency, and that H.R. 2730 directs which agency is afforded such deference. The amendment is intended to address jurisdictional concerns raised by the Judiciary Committee.</description>
