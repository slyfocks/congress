  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to allow participants in a flexible spending arrangement (FSA) to roll over up to $500 in unused benefits from one year to the next; and offset the costs of the bill by including tax provisions to prevent corporate expatriation to avoid United States income tax.</description>
