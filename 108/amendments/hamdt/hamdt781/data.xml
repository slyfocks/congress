Amendment changes the standard for getting a new trial from a "preponderance of the evidence" standard to a "compelling evidence" standard. Amendment reduces the amount authorized for capital representation and prosecution grants by $25 million and limits the amount that may be used for training and effective systems at the appellate level.
