Amendment allows for a five year time period to file a motion for a DNA test and then provides for a rebuttable presumption against the test after that. Amendment changes the standard for getting a new trial from a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard to a \"compelling evidence\" standard. Amendment reduces the amount authorized for capital representation and prosecution grants by $25 million and limits the amount that may be used for training and effective systems at the appellate level. The amendment increases the penalties for misuse of DNA samples.",
