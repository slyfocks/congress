Also makes a change regarding sole source contracts. Would strike Section 317(a), and would leave the section of the Endangered Species Act in its present form (i.e., \"prudent and determinable\"). Would strike Section 318(a), and would confine the new definition of \"harassment\" to \"military readiness activity.\".",
