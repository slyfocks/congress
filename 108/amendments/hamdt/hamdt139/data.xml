  <description>Amendment makes technical, and clarifying changes; strikes section 317(a) concerning the Endangered Species Act and maintains "prudent and determinable designation"'; and replaces section 318(a) concerning Marine Mammal Protection Act to define harassment in the case of military readiness activities.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 1 printed in House Report 108-120 to make technical changes and include clarification that no employee of DoD Inspector General who was transferred to a Special Court of the United Nations shall be subject to Hatch Act enforcement. Also makes a change regarding sole source contracts. Would strike Section 317(a), and would leave the section of the Endangered Species Act in its present form (i.e., "prudent and determinable"). Would strike Section 318(a), and would confine the new definition of "harassment" to "military readiness activity.".</purpose>
