  <description>An amendment numbered 4 printed in the Congressional Record to limit "sneak and peek" search warrants by narrowing the circumstances under which notice of the execution of the warrant is delayed to circumstances where the court finds reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the warrant "will endanger the life or physical safety of an individual, result in flight from prosecution, or result in the destruction fo or tampering with the evidence sought under the warrant.".</description>
