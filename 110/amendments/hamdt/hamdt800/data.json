Under this proposal, mortgage insurance premiums will be based on the borrower's credit history, loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and on FHA's historical experience with similar borrowers. This amendment maintains FHA reserves within the insurance fund to preserve the future solvency of the FHA program.",
