  <description>Amendment ensures that more large contracts will be reviewed as to their appropriateness to be bundled and potentially broken into smaller pieces more suitable for small business.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 4 printed in House Report 110-137 to close a loophole in the current bill that allows agencies to avoid doing small business impact studies by designating contracts as "transformed". It also lowers the new dollar threshold to ensure a greater portion of contracts are reviewed for their impact on small business as well as taxpayer savings.</purpose>
