  <description>Amendment inserts a provision related to coordination with the FAA on sonic boom research; replaces Secs. 305 and 306 with equivalent language from Secs. 903 and 905 respectively of the House-passed FAA Reauthorization, H.R. 2881 and adds suborbital reusable launch vehicles to the list of suborbital science research platforms. The amendment includes a sense of Congress on the value of NASA's EarthKam and robotics competitions for inspiring students and a sense of Congress urging NASA to use entrepreneurial companies to conduct appropriate R&amp;D and seek ways to ensure that firms that rely on fixed price proposals aren't disadvantaged. The amendment also includes NASA workforce-related provisions, including an extension of the RIF moratorium, a limit on the use of term positions in FY 2009, and a temporary continuation of coverage of health benefits.</description>
