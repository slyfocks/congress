  <description>An amendment numbered 4 printed in House Report 110-100 to ensure that all harbor maintenance is funded based on FY2004 standards, regardless of the amount of tonnage a harbor handles. Current U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' policy excludes from the Corps' budget harbors that do not meet a minimum requirement for the amount of tonnage handled.</description>
