Additionally, includes a sense of Congress that the Federal Perkins Loan Program, which provides low-interest loans to help needy students finance a degree in higher education, should remain a campus-based aid program and to support increased funds to provide more low-income students with options; and 4.) to make a technical correction to the Graduat e Assistance in Areas of National Need.(GAANN) program to clarify Congressional intent that a Masters Degree level institution or program is eligible to be the lead recipient of a grant under the GAANN program; and 5.) to prohibit a state from charging members of the armed forces who are on active duty for more than 30 days and whose domicile or permanent duty station is in such state, and such members' dependents, more than the in-state tuition for attending a public institution of higher education (IHE) in that state. Provides that, even if such members' permanent duty station is subsequently changed to a location outside the state, they or their dependents must continue to be charged no more than the in-state tuition if they remain continuously emolled at such IHE in the state.</purpose>
