  <description>Amendment sought to substitute the green building requirement with a provision that includes green building as part of the mandatory graded section. It also sought to strike references in the bill to specific green building standards and instead require the Secretary of HUD to select a rating system, standard, or code for green buildings. Such a standard would have to meet certain criteria and the Secretary would have to conduct a study every 5 years to evaluate and compare third party green building standards to see if they meet the criteria.</description>
