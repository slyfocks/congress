  "number": 83, 
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 2 printed in House Report 110-79 to balance the budget by FY 2010. It spends $395 billion on defense while projecting complete U.S. military redeployment out of Iraq during 2007. It also projects enactment of the Common Sense Budget Act, which would save at least $60 billion per year on largely obsolete Cold War weapons systems plus tens of billions more in waste, fraud, and abuse in DOD spending identified by the nonpartisan Government Accounting Office (GAO). It repeals the Bush tax cuts for the top 1% of taxpayers and cracks down on corporate welfare by eliminating certain tax breaks and corporate loopholes. It includes the SMART Security Alternative to Preemption Doctrine, which shifts some spending and increases other non-military spending to enhance homeland security and fight the root causes of terrorism through 21st century diplomacy and meeting basic human needs (e.g. HIV/AIDS/TB, universal basic education for all). It provides funding for immediate, cost-effective steps to redress global warming and the rapid acceleration of renewable energy development. It fully funds NCLB and IDEA to improve Teacher Corps and job training. It also fully funds the S-CHIP program to ensure every American child eligible is covered for basic health insurance. It ensures whatever federal funding is needed.to provide health care (including mental health care) for all American veterans (including but not limited to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan military operations). Finally, the substitute increases funding for Community Development Block Grants, Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction, community policing, and priority clean-up of leaking underground storage tanks that threaten the drinking water of nearly half of all Americans.",
