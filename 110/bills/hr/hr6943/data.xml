  <summary>9/18/2008--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an income and excise tax credit for the production of algae derived fuel and fuel mixtures. Defines "algae derived fuel" as a liquid hydrocarbon product that is derived from the biomass of algal organisms (single- or multi-cellular organisms that are inherently photosynthetic and aquatic). Terminates such credits after 2012.</summary>
