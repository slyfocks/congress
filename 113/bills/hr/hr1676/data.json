Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy (the Secretary) to use parts of the Area twice in each year for up to a total of 42 days a year for: (1) sustained, combined arms, live-fire, and maneuver field training for large-scale Marine air-ground task forces; (2) individual and unit live-fire training ranges; (3) equipment and tactics development; and (4) other defense-related purposes. Prohibits the use of dud-producing ordnance in any such military activity conducted on the Area. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer, without reimbursement, approximately 20,000 acres of specified BLM-administered land in San Bernardino County to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary. Includes such transferred land as part of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms in California."
