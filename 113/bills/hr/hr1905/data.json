Authorizes the Secretary to issue such coins beginning on January 1, 2014, except that the Secretary may initiate sales of such coins, without issuance, before such date. Terminates such minting authority after December 31, 2014. Requires coin sales to include a $10 surcharge per coin, with distribution of one-half of such surcharges to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the National Osteoporosis Foundation, respectively, for the purpose of furthering research."
