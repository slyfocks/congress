Directs the Secretary to administratively adjust the fair market value of the Three Kids Mine Federal Land based on the reasonable approximate assessment, remediation, and reclamation costs for the Three Kids Mine Project Area. Requires the Henderson Redevelopment Agency to pay the fair market value, if any for the Three Kids Mine Federal Land. Adjusts the boundary of the River Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern. Releases the United States, upon making the conveyance, from any and all liabilities or claims of any kind or nature arising from the presence, release, or threat of release of any hazardous substance or mining related materials at the Three Kids Mine Project Site. Makes the provisions of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 inapplicable to land conveyed under this Act."
