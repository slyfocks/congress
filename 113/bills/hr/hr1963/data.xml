  <summary>5/14/2013--Introduced.
Bureau of Reclamation Conduit Hydropower Development Equity and Jobs Act - Amends the Water Conservation and Utilization Act (WCUA) to: (1) repeal a provision reserving all right, title, and interest in the facilities provided for municipal or miscellaneous water supplies or surplus power and the revenues derived therefrom to the United States; (2) authorize the Secretary of the Interior (acting through the Bureau of Reclamation) to enter into leases of power privileges for electric power generation in connection with any project constructed under such Act; (3) grant the Secretary authority in addition to and alternative to any authority in existing laws related to particular projects, including small conduit hydropower development; and (4) direct the Secretary to first offer the lease of power privilege to an irrigation district or water users association operating the applicable transferred conduit or to the irrigation district or water users association receiving water from the applicable reserved conduit. Requires the Bureau to apply its categorical exclusion process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) to small conduit hydropower under WCUA, excluding siting of associated transmission facilities on federal lands. Declares that nothing in WCUA shall: (1) obligate specified power administrations to purchase or market the power produced by such facilities, (2) alter or impede the delivery and management of water for original project purposes, or (3) alter or affect any agreements in effect on the date of this Act's enactment for conduit hydropower development projects or disposition of revenues. Deems water used for conduit hydropower generation to be incidental to use of water for the original project purposes.</summary>
