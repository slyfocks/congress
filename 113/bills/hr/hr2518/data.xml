Requires OMB to submit annually for inclusion in the President's budget request reports (with follow-up reports every five fiscal years) on the total estimated cost and total actual cost of direct spending legislation for the then budget year and four outyears. Requires the President, within seven days after receiving an OMB report, to submit proposed legislative language, if any, set forth in the report to both chambers.
