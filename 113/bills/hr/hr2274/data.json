Declares such registration effective upon receipt by the SEC of a properly completed notice. Requires SEC approval of a registration, however, if the broker or an associated person is subject to suspension or revocation of registration, to a statutory disqualification, or to a disqualification under SEC rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."
