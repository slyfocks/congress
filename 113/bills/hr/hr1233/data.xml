  <summary>3/18/2013--Introduced.
Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2013 - Amends the Presidential Records Act to require the Archivist of the United States, upon determining to make available any presidential record not previously made available publicly, to: (1) promptly provide notice of such determination to the former President during whose term of office the record was created, to the incumbent President, and to the public; and (2) make such record to available to the public within 60 days, except any record with respect to which the Archivist receives notification from a former or incumbent President of a claim of constitutionally-based privilege against disclosure. Prohibits the Archivist from making a record that is subject to such a claim publicly available unless: (1) the incumbent President withdraws a decision upholding the claim, or (2) the Archivist is otherwise directed to do so by a final court order that is not subject to appeal. Prohibits the Archivist from making available any original presidential records to anyone claiming access to them as a designated representative of a President or former President if that individual has been convicted of a crime relating to the review, retention, removal, or destruction of the records of the Archives. Revises provisions relating to the acceptance of records for historical preservation by the Archivist, including revising the definition of "records" to include all recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics. Requires the Archivist to prescribe internal procedures to prevent the unauthorized removal of classified records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) or the destruction or damage of such records. Repeals provisions authorizing the National Study Commission on Records and Documents of Federal Officials. Transfers certain authorities relating to records management from the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to the Archivist.</summary>
