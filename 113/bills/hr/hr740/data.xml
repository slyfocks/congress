  <summary>2/14/2013--Introduced.
Southeast Alaska Native Land Entitlement Finalization and Jobs Protection Act - Gives Sealaska, the regional Alaska Native Corporation for southeast Alaska, 90 days following this Act's enactment to agree to accept the conveyance of specified federal land, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, as full and final satisfaction of its remaining land entitlement under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Identifies the lands to be conveyed as: (1) the 25 parcels of federal land comprising approximately 69,235 acres that are generally depicted as "Sealaska Selections" on certain Sealaska Land Entitlement Finalization maps, and (2) up to 127 cemetery sites and historical places that Sealaska must apply for and that comprise up to 840 acres of federal land. Includes with those conveyances: (1) public easements under the ANCSA, (2) a ten-year easement for Forest System research activities on study plots, and (3) an easement providing Sealaska access to and the use of the log transfer facility at Shipley Bay on Kosciusko Island. Keeps those 25 parcels of conveyed lands that are outside ANCSA withdrawal areas open for subsistence uses and noncommercial recreational uses by the public. Allows Sealaska to impose reasonable restrictions on public access to and across the conveyed lands. Requires Sealaska to allow existing guiding or outfitting special use permit holders to continue to operate on the conveyed lands for the remainder of the permit term and a subsequent ten-year renewal period. Renames certain culturally and historically significant trade and migration routes and keeps them open for travel by Sealaska and the public.</summary>
