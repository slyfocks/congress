  <summary>2/6/2013--Introduced.
Prioritize Emergency Job Creation Act - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to require that, if for FY2013-FY2021 appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that Congress and the President designate as being for emergency job creation, the adjustment to discretionary spending limits for a fiscal year shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated for emergency job creation. Requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in calculating the amount of the deficit reduction required for FY2013-FY2021 to enforce a specified budget goal under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, to further reduce the amount calculated for FY2013 by such appropriations for emergency job creation.</summary>
