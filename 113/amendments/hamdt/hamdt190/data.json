  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 15 printed in Part B of House Report 113-117 to reform U.S. international food aid to allow for not more than 45 percent of authorized funds to be used for assistance other than U.S. agricultural commodities, yielding $215 million in annual efficiency savings, enabling the U.S. to reach an additional 4 million disaster victims. Curtails practice of `monetization' which, according to the GAO, is inefficient and led to a loss of $219 million over three years. Reductions in mandatory spending result in $150 million in deficit reduction over the life of the bill.",
