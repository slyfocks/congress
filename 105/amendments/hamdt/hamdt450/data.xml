  <description>Amendment sought to establish different grazing fees for small producers controlling livestock of less than 2,000 animal unit months on Federal lands and large producers controlling livestock of 2,000 or more animal unit months.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 10, as printed in the Congressional Record, to modify the grazing fee formula in the bill. Specifically, the amendment requires operators of grazing lands of less than 2,000 AUMs to pay a grazing fee equal to the formula in the bill. However, the amendment also requires grazing land operators with more than 2,000 AUMs to pay a grazing fee equal to the bill's rates for the first 2,000 AUMs and, for any AUMs in excess of 2,000, pay a rate equal to (1) the average grazing fee for the particular state; or (2) the level of the grazing fee in the bill plus 25%, whichever is higher.</purpose>
