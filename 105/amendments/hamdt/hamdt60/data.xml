  <description>Amendment modified the administrative procedure for grievances contained in the bill to exclude evictions from public housing involving health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to modify the provisions in the bill that exclude from public housing grievance procedures all eviction proceedings that require a court hearing before an eviction can occur. The amendment would make such cases subject to grievance pro cedures if a hearing is requested within five days of notice of eviction, and require the public housing authority to take final action on the grievance within 30 days. Failure toprovide a greivance hearing or take final action within the alloted time would terminate the eviction procedures.</purpose>
