  "number": 60, 
  "purpose": "An amendment to modify the provisions in the bill that exclude from public housing grievance procedures all eviction proceedings that require a court hearing before an eviction can occur. The amendment would make such cases subject to grievance pro cedures if a hearing is requested within five days of notice of eviction, and require the public housing authority to take final action on the grievance within 30 days. Failure toprovide a greivance hearing or take final action within the alloted time would terminate the eviction procedures.",
