  <description>Amendment originally sought to increase from 5 percent to 10 percent the amount of annual gross revenue a financial holding company may derive from commercial activities. Growth above the 10 percent commercial revenue cap would be allowed at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board on a case by case basis for up to an additional five percent. \   As amended by the Leach substitute amendment (A005), the above was replaced with language that eliminates the 5 percent commercial basket for financial holding companies contained in the bill and permits a 15 percent commercial basket but phases out such authority over a 10 to 15 year period.</description>
