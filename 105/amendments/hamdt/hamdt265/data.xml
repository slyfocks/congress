  <description>Amendment sought to increase FDA tobacco initiative funding by $10 million and reduce crop insurance program funding by $14 million.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 4 as printed in the Congressional Record to increase funding for FDA salaries and expenses by $10 million to $868 million in FY 1998.

In order to offset the increase, the amendment reduces funding in the bill for crop insurance sales commissions of USDA's Risk Management Agency by $14 million to $175 million.</purpose>
