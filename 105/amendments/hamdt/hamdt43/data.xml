  <description>An amendment numbered 6 as printed in the Congressional Record to require that States must seek to terminate parental rights of children under 13 years of age who have spent 12 of their most recent 18 months in foster care. States may, however, choose not to terminate parental rights if the child is 1) being cared for by a relative, or 2) the State can document a compelling reason why terminating parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child.</description>
