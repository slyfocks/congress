  "purpose": "An amendment to terminate the National Endowment for the Arts, but retain a federal commitment to arts funding. Specifically, the amendment provides $80 million in arts funding that will be allocated to the states in two block grants as follows: (1) it directs 37% to state art commissions, allocating $29.6 million, a $3.7 million increase over the $25.9 million funding level for the NEA in FY 1997 (distributed to states based on population, with a 200,000 person minimum); (2) it directs 60% to local school boards to fund school-based arts activities, allocating $48 million (distributed to states based on its K-12 school-aged population); and (3) it allows the remaining 3% for administrative costs. Schools may not cut their own arts funding and continue to receive federal arts education grants and no funding may be used to sponsor obscene or pornographic art.",
