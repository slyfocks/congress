  <description>Amendment revises authorities concerning missing DOD military and civilian personnel.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to modify DOD procedures concerning missing service personnel to generally require that military commanders report and initiate searches for missing service personnel within 48 hours of the time they are noticed missing; to require that recovered bodies which cannot be identified by visual means be examined by a credible forensic authority to determine whether it is the body of the missing person; and to apply these procedures to civilian DOD personnel and private contractors who are working with the U.S. Armed Forces, and who disappear in war or as a result of other hostile actions.</purpose>
