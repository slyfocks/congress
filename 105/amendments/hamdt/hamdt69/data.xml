  <description>An amendment numbered 51 as printed in the Congressional Record to allow local housing authorities, if their waiting list for public housing is one year or longer, to impose a 5-year limit on the time that families or individuals may live in public housing. The elderly, disabled, and those who work more than 20 hours a week would be exempt from this 5-year limit, and any time in which a family lived in public housing prior to the bill's enactment would not count towards this limit. The amendment allows housing authorities to establish local preferences for providing housing to families who lived in public housing in a different jurisdiction and reached this 5-year limit, but who have moved into their jurisdiction to take a job.</description>
