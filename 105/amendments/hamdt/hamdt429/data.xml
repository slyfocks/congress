  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute to delete all the provisions of the bill except the provisions granting a five percent pay raise to police officers and firefighters and to insert the text of the Senate-passed version of the bill (S. 1156). Most of the legislative provisions of the House bill would be eliminated. The amendment would not provide funds for school vouchers, and appropriates $35 million less than the House bill, including $10 million more as the federal contribution to the D.C. operations.</purpose>
