  <description>Amendment originally sought to designate English as the official language of the Federal government of the United States; and require that English be the sole official language of all Federal and State communications in Puerto Rico upon statehood. \   As amended by the Burton substitute amendment (A003), the above was replaced with language that states that upon statehood, the official language requirements of the Federal government will apply to Puerto Rico to the same extent as throughout the United States; and it encourages the achieving of English proficiency.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to establish English is the official language of the United States. The amendment would specify that, should Puerto Rico choose statehood, English would be become the sole official language of all federal government activities.</purpose>
