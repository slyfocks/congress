  <description>Amendment sought to increase the authorized funding in the bill by $1.2 billion for capital grants, and increase funding by $300 million for operating grants.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to increase from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion the bill's annual authorization for public housing capital grants, and increase from $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion the bill's FY 1998 authorization for operating grants, with "such sums as necessary" authorized to fully fund public housing operating costs each subsequent year. In addition, the amendment also seeks to extend for two additional years (through FY 2002) the bill's $500 million a year authorization for public housing demolition activities but it would restrict the use of that funding to demolition, site revitalization, and rebuilding activities only.</purpose>
