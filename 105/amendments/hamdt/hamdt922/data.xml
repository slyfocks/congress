  <description>Amendment originally sought to delete language in the bill that prohibits title X health providers from providing contraceptive devices to minors unless parents had been notified. It would have added language requiring title X health providers to offer counselling to minors. \   As amended by the Istook substitute amendment (A002), the above was replaced with language reinstating parental notification requirements on title X health providers.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 2 printed in H. Rept. 105-762 to strike language that prohibits title X funding to a family planning provider that knowingly provides contraceptives to a minor without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</purpose>
