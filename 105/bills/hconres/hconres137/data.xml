  <summary>7/31/1997--Introduced.
Deplores the Iraqi Government's pattern of gross violation of human rights, condemns its repeated use of force and weapons of mass destruction against its own citizens as well as neighboring states, and denounces its refusal to comply with international human rights instruments or cooperate with international monitoring bodies and compliance mechanisms. Calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to: (1) endorse the formation of an international criminal tribunal for the purpose of prosecuting Saddam Hussein and all other Iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity; and (2) work within the international community for the adoption of a United Nations Security Council resolution establishing an International Criminal Court for Iraq.</summary>
