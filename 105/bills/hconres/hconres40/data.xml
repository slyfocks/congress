  <summary>3/6/1997--Introduced.
Recognizes that payment by the United States of its assessment for the regular budget and the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations (UN) is a solemn treaty obligation, voluntarily undertaken through U.S. ratification of the UN Charter. States Congress' belief that resolution of financing and reform issues in the UN can lead to its capability to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Concludes that U.S. leadership in meeting financial obligations to, and working with other countries to achieve reform in, the UN is indispensable to its future viability. Commits to continuing U.S. leadership in the UN by honoring U.S. past and current legal financial obligations to it. Resolves to meet the financial obligations of the United States to the UN in a full and timely manner consistent with international law and the U.S. role as a founder and responsible UN Member.</summary>
