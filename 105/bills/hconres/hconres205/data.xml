Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the situation in Kosova must be resolved before the outer wall of sanctions against Serbia is lifted and Serbia is able to return to the international community; (2) the human rights of the people of Kosova must be restored; (3) the United States should support the legitimate claims of such people to determine their own political future; (4) a solution to the conflict can only be achieved through dialogue, not violence; (5) the March 22, 1998, elections in Kosova should be permitted to proceed without interference by the Belgrade authorities and, if conducted freely and fairly, the United States should recognize the results; (6) international observers should be returned to Kosova and monitors should be dispatched to observe such elections; (7) the elected Government of Kosova should be permitted to meet and exercise its legitimate mandate as elected representatives of the people; (8) all individuals whose employment was terminated based on their ethnicity should be reinstated; (9) the agreement on education in Kosova should be implemented immediately; (10) the students of the University of Pristina have the full support of the United States as they peacefully demonstrate to return to classes; (11) efforts of the international Contact Group in support of a resolution of the conflict are to be commended; and (12) the President should appoint a special envoy to aid in negotiating a resolution to the crisis in Kosova.</summary>
