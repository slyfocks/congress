Encourages such agencies to: (1) review oceanography and marine resource management policies and programs; (2) identify opportunities to improve interagency cooperation, to further cooperation between the United States and other nations to enhance oceanographic research and exploration, and to strengthen international marine resource conservation policies and programs; (3) develop scientific, educational, and resource management programs that will advance ocean exploration, the conservation of marine habitats and species, and the sustainable use of ocean resources; and (4) encourage participation in State, local, and private initiatives and programs that use education and the arts to increase public awareness of the ocean and its many benefits, and to foster understanding of the need to conserve and sustainably manage ocean resources."
