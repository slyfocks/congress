Urges: (1) the President and officials he designates to work with the Congress to draft legislation and regulations which will permit the claims of ethnic Albanians from Kosova who have suffered as a consequence of the actions of Serbian police and military forces in Kosova to be considered, without prejudice to the claims of U.S. nationals, when claims settlement negotiations involving the assets of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), which the United States has blocked or asserted control over, take place; (2) that in drafting such legislation and implementing regulations, special consideration be given to the circumstances of the Government of the Republic of Montenegro and to persons located in Montenegro; and (3) the President and the Secretary of State to urge all other countries to follow a policy which permits ethnic Albanians who have suffered as a consequence of the actions of Serbian police and military forces in Kosova to make claims against the assets of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which are in the control of the respective country."
