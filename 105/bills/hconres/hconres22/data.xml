  <summary>11/9/1997--Failed of passage in House.
Declares that the Congress continues to hold Germany responsible for protecting the rights of U.S. citizens who are living, performing, doing business, or traveling in Germany as provided under international agreements. Deplores the actions and statements of officials in Germany which have fostered an atmosphere of intolerance toward certain minority religious groups. Expresses concern that artists from the United States who are members of minority religious groups continue to experience German Government discrimination. Urges the German Government to take action necessary to protect rights guaranteed to members of minority religious groups by international covenants. Calls upon the President to: (1) assert the concern of the U.S. Government regarding German Government discrimination against members of minority religious groups; (2) emphasize that the United States regards the human rights practices of the German Government, particularly its treatment of Americans in Germany, as a significant factor in U.S. relations with Germany; and (3) encourage other governments to appeal to the German Government, and to cooperate with other governments and international organizations, in efforts to protect the rights of foreign citizens and members of minority religious groups in Germany.</summary>
