Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking - Authorizes the Senate to reduce revenue and spending aggregates and allocations only for legislation that reduces revenues by providing family tax relief and incentives to stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth, if such legislation will not increase the deficit or reduce the surplus for: (1) FY 1999; (2) the period of FY 1999 through 2003; or (3) the period of FY 2004 through 2008.

Authorizes increased aggregates, allocations, and outlays in the case of a reported Senate bill to reform the Superfund program that does not exceed specified limits on budget authority and outlays for FY 1999 and the period of FY 1999 through 2003. (Sec. 204) Permits the Senate Budget Committee Chairman to reserve estimated reductions in new budget authority and outlays resulting from changes in legislation affecting specified programs, if contained in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, for purposes of offsetting limited additional outlays for discretionary highway programs and additional budget authority for discretionary transit programs as called for in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998. Describes programs subject to reductions in mandatory spending. Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to veterans' compensation for post-service smoking related illnesses.
