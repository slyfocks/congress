Urges: (1) both governments to investigate abuses of slavery; (2) the United Nations Security Council to condemn these acts of slavery by both governments; and (3) the Secretary of the Treasury not to waive any of the current sanctions that are in place against Sudan. Deplores the fighting of the National Islam Front. Advocates strengthening the border between northern and southern Sudan. Encourages human rights organizations to facilitate safe passage for slavery victims to and from conflict zones. Commends the Clinton Administration for sanctioning Sudan and monitoring the acts of Mauritania regarding slavery."
