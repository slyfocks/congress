Declares that it is not in the best interest of children to: (1) force parents to share custody over parental objection, or when there is a history of domestic or family violence; (2) punish abused or protective parents who protect themselves or their children; (3) presume that allegations of domestic and family violence are likely to be false, or made for tactical advantage during custody and divorce proceedings; and (4) make \"friendly parent\" provisions a factor when there is an abusive parent. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) child abuse and child sexual abuse allegations should be investigated regardless of when raised or whether the child has recanted the allegation; (2) States should be more protective of victims of family and domestic violence in custody and visitation determinations and not order mediation, couples counseling, shared custody, mutual orders of protection, unsupervised visitation, or other measures when they may endanger such victims; and (3) States should provide training in domestic violence and child abuse, as they impact custody, child support and visitation determinations, to all professionals who interact with children and parents."
