  <summary>10/2/1998--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Forest Service should: (1) not close shooting or archery facilities without prior notification to the Congress and the general public unless there is an immediate threat to public safety; (2) avoid unreasonable restrictions in the issuance of special-use permits for firearm and archery sports facilities; (3) fully evaluate alternative sites in the Coronado National Forest, to the extent consistent with the environmental assessment, and provide a reasonable alternative that would allow the Tucson Rod and Gun Club to quickly open a safe facility for firearm and archery sports; and (4) adhere to its deadline of November 20, 1998, for a decision on a site for such Club.</summary>
