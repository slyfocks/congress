  <summary>6/9/1998--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States abides by all previous understandings of a "one China" policy and its abiding interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Straits issue; and (2) the President should seek, at the June summit meeting this year in Beijing, a public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any use of force, or threat to use force, against Taiwan.</summary>
