  <summary>10/10/1998--Introduced.
Urges the President and appropriate representatives of the Government of Chile to engage in negotiations to conclude a free trade agreement between the United States and Chile in the absence of fast track authority. Urges the President, in conducting such negotiations, to: (1) assess whether U.S. tariffs on agriculture products that were bound under the Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound by Chile; (2) consult with the Congress on whether it is appropriate for the United States to agree to further tariff reductions based on such assessment; and (3) consult with specified congressional committees before entering into any such trade agreement.</summary>
