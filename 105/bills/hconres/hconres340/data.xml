Calls for the President to: (1) take appropriate action to bring Iraq into compliance with such obligations; (2) insist on the removal, destruction, or rendering harmless of Iraq's programs for biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons; (3) fully support the right of inspectors of the UN Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) to unfettered and unannounced inspections of suspected weapons facilities; and (4) not renege on past warnings issued by the President, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense that the United States is committed to using military force, if necessary, to punish Iraq for interfering with or obstructing UNSCOM's weapons inspections.</summary>
