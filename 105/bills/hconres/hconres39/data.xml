  <summary>3/6/1997--Introduced.
Reaffirms the universal nature of human rights and the principle that women's rights are human rights. Supports: (1) the inter-agency council on women; and (2) action on the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Considers that dedication to enacting U.S. commitments to promote the following would benefit citizens around the world: (1) economic security; (2) the human rights of women; (3) the health of women and children; (4) the empowerment of women and the strengthening of families; and (5) women's legal status and political participation. Encourages the U.S. Government to build on the strong partnership of nongovernmental organizations and governments that developed during the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women. Urges governmental actions that uphold and enact the tenets of the platform for action and the commitments of the United States made at the Conference.</summary>
