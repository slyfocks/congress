  <summary>11/13/1997--Passed House amended.
Recognizes those Kenyans who have demonstrated their love of peace, law, and order and condemns those who are inciting others to violence, looting, and destroying property. Urges: (1) an immediate cessation to the violence in Kenya; (2) the Government of Kenya to take all necessary and lawful steps to avoid more violence in the future; (3) rapid progress toward conducting free and fair elections; and (4) the U.S. Government and the international community to work with all parties to encourage the Kenyan Government to ensure a lasting and committed transition to democracy, including an immediate review of the propriety of the time of the next elections. Recognizes President Daniel Arap Moi's response to domestic and international pressure to allow meaningful constitutional and legal electoral process reform through the current package of legislation agreed to by the ruling party and the opposition party representatives. Calls for the prodemocracy movement to remain unified in working toward implementing constitutional, statutory, and administrative reforms.</summary>
