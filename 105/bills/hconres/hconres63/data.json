Reaffirms the commitment expressed in the original Marshall Plan that: (1) extensive and friendly relations with the nations of Europe and the community of European nations are vital to the promotion of the general welfare and national interest of the United States; and (2) prosperity and security of Europe are essential to the establishment of a lasting peace. Acknowledges the efforts of those countries which originally participated in the Marshall Plan to assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union in their efforts to develop market economies and democratic political systems as a reflection of the same spirit that motivated the people of the United States to help these Western European countries 50 years ago."
