  <summary>10/8/1998--Introduced.
Urges all international organizations, foreign countries, and U.S. agencies engaged in economic development, humanitarian, and other forms of bilateral or multilateral assistance to evaluate the ability of such assistance to achieve the amelioration of human suffering in each region of Somalia. Urges the President not to delay, diminish, or cancel the amounts and kinds of assistance: (1) otherwise appropriate to the people of certain regions in Somalia because conditions may not be propitious for such assistance in other Somali regions; and (2) directed toward any region in Somalia waiting for a permanent resolution of the efforts now underway to forge a new government for Somalia. Calls upon all Somali parties to continue to work toward a permanent end to the civil strife there and the adoption of a permanent governmental structure most conducive to the well-being and basic human rights of all Somali people. Calls on the President to: (1) work with the international community to help bring an end to the suffering of the Somali people and work toward a negotiated settlement of the Somali conflict; (2) increase the levels of humanitarian assistance provided to Somalia; (3) provide funding for demobilization and demining efforts in Somalia; (4) provide assistance in the health and education sectors of Somalia; and (5) work with other donor groups to assist the Somali people in reconstruction and development.</summary>
