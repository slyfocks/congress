  <summary>11/13/1997--Passed House amended.
Expresses support for: (1) the efforts of the Mongolian parliament to establish United States-Mongolian Friendship Day; (2) efforts by the United States and Mongolia to use their resources to strengthen political, economic, educational, and cultural ties; (3) an independent, sovereign, secure, and democratic Mongolia; and (4) future contacts between such countries in such a manner as will benefit the parliamentary, judicial, and political institutions of Mongolia, particularly through the creation of an interparliamentary exchange between the Congress and the Mongolian parliament. Applauds and encourages Mongolia's simultaneous efforts to develop its democratic and free market institutions. Commends: (1) Mongolia for its foresight in environmental protection through the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan and encourages it to obtain the goals illustrated in this Plan; and (2) Mongolia's efforts to strengthen civilian control, through parliamentary oversight, over the military. Encourages Mongolia's efforts toward economic development that are compatible with environmental protection and supports an exchange of ideas and information between Mongolian and U.S. scientists. Urges the President: (1) both through the vote of the United States in international financial institutions and in the administration of U.S. bilateral assistance programs, such as the Central Asian Enterprise Fund, to support Mongolia in its efforts to expand economic opportunity through free market structures and policies; (2) to assist Mongolia in its efforts to integrate itself into international economic structures, such as the World Trade Organization; and (3) to promote efforts to increase commercial investment in Mongolia by U.S. businesses and to promote policies which will increase economic cooperation and development between the United States and Mongolia.</summary>
