Urges: (1) the Government of Syria to use its good offices with the various paramilitary groups in Syria and in areas in which it has influence to bring about a resolution of this issue and secure the safe return of such soldiers; and (2) the President and the Secretary of State, as they formulate U.S. policy toward each government or authority in the Middle East, to take into consideration the level of assistance provided by that government or authority in resolving these cases.</summary>
