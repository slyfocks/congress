    "text": "Expresses the sense of the Congress that trafficking: (1) consists of all acts involved in the recruitment or transportation of persons within or across borders involving deception, coercion or force, abuse of authority, debt bondage or fraud, for the purpose of placing persons in situations of abuse or exploitation; and (2) involves kidnapping, false imprisonment, rape, battering, forced labor, or slavery-like practices which violate fundamental human rights. Urges the Department of Justice Office of Violence Against Women to report to the Congress on: (1) efforts to identify instances of trafficking of persons into the United States within the last five years; (2) the successes or difficulties experienced in promoting interagency cooperation, cooperation between local, State, and Federal authorities, and cooperation with nongovernmental organizations; (3) the treatment and services provided and the disposition of trafficking cases in the criminal justice system; and (4) legal and administrative barriers to more effective governmental responses. Urges that trafficking victims be provided with support services and incentives to testify. Calls on the Secretary of State to: (1) develop curricula and conduct training for consular officers on the prevalence and risks of trafficking and the rights of victims; and (2) develop and disperse to visa seekers written materials describing the potential risks of trafficking. Commends the Department of State and the European Union for their joint initiative to promote awareness of the problem of trafficking throughout countries of origin in Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union. Urges their continued efforts to engage in similar programs in other regions and to ensure that the dignity and human rights of trafficking victims are protected in destination countries. Calls for: (1) the State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs to continue to provide and expand funding to support criminal justice training programs which include trafficking; and (2) the President's Interagency Council on Women to report to the Congress regarding implementation by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General of the duties described in this resolution."
