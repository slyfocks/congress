Deems the House Committees on Commerce and Ways and Means to be in noncompliance with reconciliation instructions pursuant to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 if such committees provide a children's health initiative that would increase the deficit by more than specified amounts for FY 1998 through 2002.
