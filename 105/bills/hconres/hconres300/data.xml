Declares that the Congress affirms: (1) its longstanding commitment to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act; (2) its expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means and that it considers any effort to determine Taiwan's future by other than peaceful means a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States; (3) its commitment to make available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability; and (4) its commitment that only the President and Congress shall determine the nature and quantity of defense articles and services needed by Taiwan. Urges the President to seek a public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any use of force, or threat to use force, against democratic Taiwan.</summary>
