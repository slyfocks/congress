  <summary>9/10/1997--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress relating to the timely distribution of payments to local educational agencies (LEAs) under the Impact Aid (IA) program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Declares such IA program should be funded at a level that allows its funds to be made available on the currently-required, forward-funded basis. Declares that the Secretary of Education, upon completion of the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for each fiscal year, should distribute such IA program payments to eligible LEAs within 45 days after the enactment of each such Act, if other congressional action has not caused a delay and State education agencies have supplied all the necessary information to the Department of Education for such distribution of payments.</summary>
