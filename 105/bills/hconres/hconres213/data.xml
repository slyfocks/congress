  <summary>8/4/1998--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) many nations, including the European Union, unfairly restrict the importation of U.S. agricultural products; (2) the elimination of such restrictions should be a top priority of any current or future trade negotiation; (3) the President should develop a trade agenda which addresses agricultural trade barriers in multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations and pursues full compliance with dispute settlement decisions of the World Trade Organization (WTO); (4) in such negotiations, the United States should seek to obtain competitive opportunities for U.S. exports of agricultural products in foreign markets equivalent to those afforded to foreign exports in U.S. markets; (5) the U.S. Trade Representative should not engage in any trade negotiation with the European Union that undermines U.S. ability to achieve a successful result in the WTO negotiations on agriculture set to begin in December 1999; and (6) the President should consult with the Congress with respect to trade negotiations in agriculture.</summary>
