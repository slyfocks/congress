  <summary>10/1/1998--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) if the Government of Mexico does not take actions to recognize and mitigate the inadequacy of sewage infrastructure facilities in Mexico and the adverse environmental and economic impacts of sewage from Mexico on U.S. cities, the United States should review its obligations with Mexico under treaties and other international agreements and take actions to ensure that the Government of Mexico shares in the burdens caused by its sewage infrastructure problems; and (2) any measurement of the responsiveness of the Government of Mexico to requests to mitigate its sewage treatment problems should be based on risk assessment procedures developed in consultation with the San Diego County Health Officer.</summary>
