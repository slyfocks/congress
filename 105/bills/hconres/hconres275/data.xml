  <summary>5/12/1998--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Department of the Treasury's determination that certain large capacity military magazine rifles may not be imported into the United States because they are functionally identical to banned semiautomatic assault weapons: (1) is consistent with the Congress' intent in enacting the ban on semiautomatic assault weapons while honoring the requirement to allow the importation of firearms that are particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes; and (2) will have a significant impact in maintaining the safety of our streets and in protecting our citizens from harm.</summary>
