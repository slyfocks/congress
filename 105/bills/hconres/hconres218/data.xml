  <summary>4/28/1998--Passed House amended.
Acknowledges: (1) that the Afghan people successfully waged a war against Soviet expansionism and greatly assisted in bringing an end to the cold war; (2) a continuing need for international emergency aid of food, clothing, and shelter in the wake of the February 4, 1998, earthquake in northeastern Afghanistan; and (3) the necessity of international efforts to clear the estimated 10 million land mines buried in the Afghan countryside. Calls upon all warring factions and national powers to participate in intra-Afghan dialogue and in the peace process and to actively cooperate in the acceleration of endeavors for peace. Deplores human rights violations occurring within Afghanistan and supports investigation by the United Nations (UN) and the International Committee of the Red Cross of reported killings. Welcomes the appointment of Ambassador Lakhbar Brahimi as special envoy of the UN Secretary General for Afghanistan and his efforts toward attaining a peaceful negotiated settlement. Encourages a role for Afghan leaders of all factions and ethnic groups in the UN negotiation efforts. Urges: (1) the nations of the region to cooperate in the peace process and to end military support to all parties to the conflict; (2) appropriate parties in the UN, Afghanistan, and its neighbors to work toward the eradication of the production of opium; (3) all parties within Afghanistan to prevent the reoccurrence of actions which impede food shipments and other humanitarian assistance into Afghanistan; and (4) the expulsion of all known terrorist leaders from Afghanistan and the closing down of all terrorist training camps operating in the country. Recognizes the continuing requirement to address the needs of more than 2.5 million Afghan refugees in neighboring countries.</summary>
