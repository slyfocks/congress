  <summary>9/25/1997--Introduced.
Condemns the deployment of U.S. military personnel in the service of the United Nations (UN) in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a violation of both the Constitution and Federal laws. Calls upon the President to: (1) take total command of all such personnel participating in UN operations and ensure that they wear only the U.S. uniform without any UN items and carry only U.S. issued military identity cards; and (2) take all steps necessary to resolve all existing conflicts with such personnel who have refused to serve under foreign commanders in foreign uniforms, consistent with the Constitution and principles of this resolution.</summary>
