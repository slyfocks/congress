    "text": "Requires the Architect of the Capitol to: (1) develop and implement a cost-effective energy conservation strategy for all facilities administered by Congress to achieve 20 percent reduction in energy consumption compared to FY 1991 within seven years after adoption of this resolution; (2) submit to the Congress a comprehensive energy conservation and management plan, including life cycle costs methods to determine the cost-effectiveness of proposed energy efficiency projects; (3) submit a request for necessary appropriations; (4) report annually to the Congress on congressional energy management and conservation programs; (5) perform energy surveys of all congressional buildings and attendant updates; (6) use such surveys to determine the cost and payback period of energy and water conservation measures likely to achieve requisite energy consumption levels; and (7) install energy and water conservation measures that will achieve the requirements through previously determined life cycle cost methods and procedures. Authorizes the Architect to: (1) contract with nongovernmental entities and employ private sector capital to finance energy conservation projects and achieve energy consumption targets; (2) develop innovative contracting methods to attract private sector funding for the installation of energy-efficient and renewable energy technology; and (3) participate in the Department of Energy's Financing Renewable Energy and Efficiency (FREE Savings) contracts program for Federal Government facilities. Directs the Architect to produce information packages and guides for each Member and employing authority of the Congress that detail simple, cost-effective methods to save energy."
