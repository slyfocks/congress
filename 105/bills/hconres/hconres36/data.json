Commends the efforts by the High Commissioner for National Minorities of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the Working Group on Ethnic Minorities of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia to offer guidance and mediation to the Macedonian Government and representatives of the Albanian minority in resolving the issue of higher education in the Albanian language. Urges the President to: (1) express to that Government strong U.S. support for measures that will contribute to democracy and stability in Macedonia; and (2) offer appropriate support for the efforts of the High Commissioner and the Macedonian Government to ensure access to higher education in the Albanian language."
