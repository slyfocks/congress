  <summary>7/28/1998--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States should: (1) publicly declare that the Albanians of Kosova have a legal right to self-determination and that independence is the only solution acceptable to the Kosovars; (2) support and sponsor Kosovar Albanians' right of self-determination; (3) provide its share of resources necessary to facilitate independence for Kosova; (4) in conjunction with United Nations members and other multilateral organizations, convene a working group that deals with the specifics of secession in order to prevent future civil conflict from rising to the level of a breach of international peace and security and that facilitates constructive dialogue in order to prevent violence; and (5) use any and all means necessary to remove impediments to the Kosovar Albanians' right to self-determination.</summary>
