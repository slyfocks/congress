  <summary>10/10/1998--Passed House amended.
Declares that, in observance of the 59th anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet Pact of Non-Aggression, the Congress: (1) reaffirms the U.S. policy of the non-recognition of the occupation by the Soviet Union of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia subsequent to the Pact, which for the 50 years after the signing of the Pact, was a commendable bipartisan policy that refused to legally recognize the Soviet occupation of such countries; (2) urges Russia to renounce the Nazi-Soviet Pact of Non-Aggression and its secret supplemental protocols as illegal; (3) welcomes and supports the signing of the United States-Baltic Charter by the United States, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia that reiterates the strong historical kinship between the peoples of these countries; and (4) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to work to ensure that Russia understands that the Nazi-Soviet Pact of Non-Aggression should be considered illegal and null and void.</summary>
