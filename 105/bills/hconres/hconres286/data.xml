  <summary>6/3/1998--Introduced.
Recognizes that individuals who abuse animals are more likely to commit more serious violent crimes against humans. Urges: (1) social workers, teachers, mental health professionals, and others to be aware of the connection between animal cruelty and human violence and to evaluate carefully and monitor closely individuals who have a history of abusing animals; (2) appropriate Federal agencies to encourage and support research to increase the understanding of the connection between cruelty to animals and violence against humans; (3) Federal agencies which are undertaking research on violent crime and its causes to incorporate examination of the link between violence against animals and violence against humans; and (4) local law enforcement officials to treat cases of animal cruelty seriously. Commends the work of local animal control officials and humane investigators who enforce laws against animal abuse. Urges them to work more closely with local law enforcement personnel to identify and prevent potential violence against humans.</summary>
