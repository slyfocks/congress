  <summary>9/4/1997--Introduced.
Declares that the following conduct by the Attorney General constitutes a failure to take care that the laws are faithfully executed: (1) refusal to seek application for an independent counsel pursuant to a House Committee on the Judiciary request in letters dated March 12, 1997, and September 3, 1997; and (2) failure to send to the Senate a nomination for the now vacant office of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, while allowing the functions of such office to be carried out by a person acting in apparent violation of the Vacancies Act, resulting in the absence of prosecutors accountable to the Congress as well as the executive branch with respect to criminal-law-related investigations of executive branch officials.</summary>
