  <summary>6/9/1998--Passed House amended.
States that the House of Representatives: (1) recognizes that the creation of a better America depends in large part on the active involvement of fathers in the rearing and development of their children; (2) urges each father to accept his full share of responsibility for the lives of his children, and to be actively involved in rearing them, and to encourage their academic, moral, and spiritual development; (3) encourages each father to devote time, energy, and resources to his children, recognizing that they need not only material support, but more importantly a secure, affectionate, family environment; and (4) expresses its support for a national summit on fatherhood.</summary>
