  <summary>7/15/1997--Introduced.
Amends rule XI (rules of procedures for committees) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to provide that a committee or subcommittee may adopt a written rule permitting proxy voting if the proxy authorization: (1) is in writing; (2) asserts that the Member is absent on official business in the District of Columbia; (3) designates the individual who is to execute the proxy authorization; and (4) limits such vote to a specific measure or matter and any amendments or motions pertaining thereto for one day. Permits a Member to authorize a general proxy only for motions to recess or adjourn. Requires that a proxy: (1) be signed by the Member assigning his or her vote; (2) contain the date and time of such signature; (3) be accompanied by a written statement as to the specific official duties the Member will be engaged in that preclude being present to vote. Prohibits proxies from being counted for a quorum.</summary>
