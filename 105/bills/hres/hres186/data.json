Permits a Member to authorize a general proxy only for motions to recess or adjourn. Requires that a proxy: (1) be signed by the Member assigning his or her vote; (2) contain the date and time of such signature; (3) be accompanied by a written statement as to the specific official duties the Member will be engaged in that preclude being present to vote. Prohibits proxies from being counted for a quorum."
