Makes a specified amount available for expenses of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, including the expenses of staff salaries, for the 105th Congress. Sets forth first and second session limitations. Establishes a reserve fund for unanticipated expenses of committees for the 105th Congress to be paid to them pursuant to allocations approved by the Committee on House Oversight. Grants such Committee the authority to make adjustments in the amount made available for the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight if necessary to comply with a presidential sequestration order or to conform to any reduction in appropriations with respect to the other standing and select committees. Provides that any net increase in the aggregate amount of committees expenses for 105th Congress over the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for such expenses for the 104th Congress shall be offset by reductions in expenses for other legislative branch activities."
