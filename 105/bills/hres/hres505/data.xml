  <summary>7/20/1998--Introduced.
Declares that: (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to remain actively engaged in the South Pacific region as a means of supporting important U.S. commercial and strategic interests, and to encourage the consolidation of democratic values; (2) a Pacific island summit, hosted by the President with the Pacific island heads of government, would be an excellent opportunity for the United States to foster and improve diplomatic relations with the Pacific island nations; and (3) the United States should fulfill its longstanding commitment to the democratization and economic prosperity of the Pacific island nations by promoting their earliest integration in the mainstream of bilateral, regional, and global commerce and trade.</summary>
