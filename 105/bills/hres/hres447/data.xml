  <summary>6/9/1998--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the first Government-wide financial audit demonstrated serious concerns with financial management by the majority of Federal agencies; (2) current efforts with respect to agency financial management have failed; and (3) Congress must impose consequences on agencies that fail their annual financial audits and conduct more vigorous oversight to ensure that Federal agencies do not waste tax dollars.</summary>
