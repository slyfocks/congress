Declares that the Congress: (1) supports the men and women of the armed forces who are carrying out their missions; and (2) reaffirms that it should be U.S. policy to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.</summary>
