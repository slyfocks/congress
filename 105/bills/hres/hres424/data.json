    "text": "Comprehensive Travel Reform Rule of 1998 - Requires each Member, officer, and employee of the House of Representatives to report to the Clerk of the House on the following categories of travel undertaken by the individual: (1) travel for which payment is made from the Members' representational allowance or from the accounts of a House committee or office, other than travel undertaken by a Member (or by his or her employee or an employee of a committee on which the Member is the chair or ranking minority member) between the Member's district and the District of Columbia; (2) travel within a foreign country for which payment is made by the foreign government; and (3) travel in support of the official business of such individual for which payment is made from any source other than described above. Sets forth the contents of such reports and includes within them (for travel paid for by certain nonprofit organizations) a copy of the organizations' contributions and expenditures filed with the IRS and a copy of their schedule of contributions of $5,000 or more received by them during a taxable year. Requires the report within 30 (currently, 60) days after the completion of the travel involved. Makes conforming amendments to rule XI (committee travel expenses) and rule LI (gift ban) of the Rules of the House. Requires the Clerk to notify the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct of any Member, officer, or employee who reports after the applicable deadline or whose report fails to meet the requirements of this Act. Provides for: (1) quarterly compilations of such travel reports as well as annual reports of all House travel to be published in the Congressional Record; and (2) availability of such reports on the Internet. Prohibits a Member, officer, or employee from accepting any of the travel described in this Act for which: (1) first class airfare is provided; or (2) the total costs of meals and lodging exceed the amount of the maximum per diem rate set forth in applicable Federal law for other government employees. Exempts travel expenses incurred on behalf of either the spouse or a child of the Member, officer, or employee from restrictions on privately-funded gifts for spouse or family member travel only if the travel is not offered or enhanced because of the official position of the Member, officer, or employee and is customarily provided to others in similar circumstances. Allows the total expenditure for travel under this Act for an individual to exceed the published per diem rate applicable for Federal employees who are not Members, officers, or employees of the House only if the Member or officer involved authorizes the expenditure of a greater amount before the travel occurs. Prohibits a Member, officer, or employee of the House from accepting any official travel paid by private sources unless the travel is preauthorized by the Committee."
