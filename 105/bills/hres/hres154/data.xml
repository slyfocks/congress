  <summary>5/20/1997--Introduced.
Calls for: (1) all Members of Congress to take appropriate action to ensure the safety and protection of children in their jurisdictions; (2) State governments to have in effect laws which register offenders convicted of sexual crimes against children and laws which require law enforcement to notify communities of the presence of these offenders; (3) States to have in effect laws which severely punish individuals convicted of offenses against children, especially crimes involving abduction, sexual assault, exploitation, and stalking; (4) law enforcement agencies to take the necessary steps to safeguard children against the dangers of abduction and exploitation; and (5) State and local law enforcement agencies to work in close cooperation with Federal law enforcement to ensure a rapid and efficient response to reports of child abduction, especially in cases where a child's life may be in danger.</summary>
