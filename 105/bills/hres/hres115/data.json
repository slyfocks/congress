Urges the U.S. Government to: (1) unequivocally call on Mobutu to immediately leave Zaire and withdraw from all political activity; and (2) play a leading role in the international effort in supporting the creation of a broad-based transitional government of national unity composed of all democratic forces in Zaire. Calls for the United States to: (1) continue to distance itself and its foreign policy from Mobutu and his government; (2) work with interested African and European nations to oppose the presence in Zaire of foreign government and mercenary forces, to halt the flow of arms into the country, and to encourage the warring parties to negotiate a cease-fire leading to a lasting peace; and (3) pursue an immediate agreement to permit the provision of humanitarian relief and the presence of international humanitarian workers to aid refugees and displaced persons in Zaire. Supports the creation in Zaire of the enabling environment necessary to conduct democratic, multi-party elections at the earliest feasible time, as well as the necessary conditions to establish the rule of law, respect for human rights, and the effective provision of humanitarian assistance."
