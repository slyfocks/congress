Urges the U.S. Government to continue to work closely with the Algerian Government to bring about the development and implementation of political and economic reforms as well as the full restoration of law and order in Algeria. Encourages: (1) the European Union and the Algerian Government to further their cooperation against terrorism; and (2) the Algerian Government to accept the appointment of a Special Rapporteur by the United Nations or another qualified independent organization to conduct an inquiry into human rights violations in Algeria."
