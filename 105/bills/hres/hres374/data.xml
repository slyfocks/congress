Encourages: (1) the European Union and the Algerian Government to further their cooperation against terrorism; and (2) the Algerian Government to accept the appointment of a Special Rapporteur by the United Nations or another qualified independent organization to conduct an inquiry into human rights violations in Algeria.</summary>
