Encourages the U.S. Government to condemn such intervention and to withhold any military training and assistance to Angola until it ceases all military activities in the Congo. Expresses concern that the U.S. Government has sought to strengthen military ties with the Angolan Government in advance of the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and the creation of a meaningful role for former members of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the Angolan military. Urges both the U.S. and Angolan Governments to continue their commitments to the Lusaka Protocol and the Angolan peace process despite the imposition of sanctions on UNITA by the United Nations Security Council."
