  <summary>3/30/1998--Passed House amended.
Urges the President to: (1) expeditiously procure and provide to the Colombian National Police three UH-60L Blackhawk utility helicopters to assist them in performing their responsibilities to reduce and eliminate the production of illicit drugs in Colombia and the trafficking of such drugs; and (2) promptly inform the Congress, if the President determines that such procurement and transfer is inadequate to maintain such Police's operational feasibility and effectiveness, as to the appropriate number of additional helicopters for such Police so that amounts can be authorized for the procurement and transfer of such additional helicopters. Supports maintaining assistance for Bolivia at least at the level assumed in the President's FY 1998 budget submission and directs the administration to act accordingly.</summary>
