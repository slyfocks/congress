  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, upon the engrossment in the House of any general appropriations bill (or resolution making continuing appropriations, if applicable), to: (1) reduce the suballocation of new budget authority or outlays to the appropriate subcommittee by the net amount of reductions resulting from amendments agreed to by the House to that bill; and (2) report those revisions to the House. Prohibits the reductions in suballocations from being reallocated by the Committee on Appropriations to any other subcommittee. Requires, upon the reporting of revised suballocations to the House by the Committee on Appropriations, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget to: (1) make appropriate revisions in the allocations to the Committee on Appropriations to reflect the revised suballocations; and (2) report those revisions to the House. Deems, in the House, such revised suballocations and revised allocations as suballocations and allocations made under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.</summary>
