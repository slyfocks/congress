  <summary>3/17/1998--Passed House amended.
Calls upon the Cambodian Government to: (1) implement the Paris Peace Accords; (2) enforce the rule of law and protect human rights; (3) restore a nonviolent and neutral political atmosphere, including strict adherence to the ceasefire announced on February 27, 1998; (4) allow all exiled opposition leaders to return to Cambodia and engage in political activity without fear of political or physical reprisal; and (5) take further measures to create mechanisms to help ensure a credible election. Commends the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for its efforts to restore democratic governance in Cambodia and urges a continuation of these efforts. Calls upon the European Union to reconsider its decision to provide assistance to the election process until genuinely free and fair elections can be conducted. Urges the Secretary of State to: (1) continue to provide support through appropriate nongovernmental organizations to Cambodian human rights workers; and (2) work with members of ASEAN and the Donors Group in urging the Cambodian Government to create the conditions which would guarantee a free and fair election. Calls upon the Cambodian Government to work cooperatively with the Phnom Penh office of the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and urges the U.S. Government and the international community to support the Centre's efforts to promote human rights in Cambodia by providing the additional financial assistance needed to increase the number of United Nations human rights monitors in Cambodia. Expresses the House of Representatives' unwillingness to accept as legitimate or as worthy of U.S. assistance any Cambodian government that arises from a fraudulent electoral process.</summary>
