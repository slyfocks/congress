Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) ending social promotion in the schools should be addressed through a coordinated effort by government officials, teachers, and parents committed to high academic achievement of students; (2) State Education Agencies and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds should make every effort to address and end social promotion; (3) problems associated with social promotion can be resolved through providing high-quality training and education for our teachers, and using other proven practices; and (4) States should adopt high, rigorous standards and standards-based assessments to require academic accountability with the specific aim of ending social promotion and raising student achievement.</summary>
