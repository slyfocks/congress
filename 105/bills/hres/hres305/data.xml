  <summary>11/5/1997--Introduced.
Waives provisions of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives that require a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House with respect to resolutions reported by such Committee before November 10, 1997, to provide for the consideration or disposition of a bill or joint resolution (including any amendment, conference report, or any amendment from conference in disagreement thereon) that: (1) makes general appropriations for FY 1998; or (2) includes provisions making continuing appropriations for FY 1998. Makes it in order at any time before November 10, 1997, for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend the rules, provided that the object of any such motion is announced from the House floor at least one hour before its consideration. Provides that, during the remainder of the first session of the 105th Congress, a resolution noticed as a question of the privileges of the House between November 4, 1997, and the adoption of this resolution shall have precedence of all other questions except motions to adjourn only at a time designated by the Speaker. Prohibits the Speaker from recognizing a Member other than the majority or minority leader to offer from the floor, or to announce an intention to offer, a resolution as a question of the privileges of the House.</summary>
