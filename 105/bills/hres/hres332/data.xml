  <summary>11/13/1997--Introduced.
Condemns the continuing religious and ethnic discrimination against Assyrians, and denial of basic human rights to Assyrians in the Near East. Reaffirms that all Assyrians should be entitled to freely practice their religion, speak their language, practice their customs, and celebrate their culture. Urges the governments of the Near East to cooperate fully to ensure that their rights are respected. Urges the President to: (1) call for an end to the government-sponsored persecution of Assyrians; and (2) instruct the Secretary of State to address the issue of Assyrian rights through appropriate bilateral and multilateral forums, and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to work in that body to address the issue of discrimination against Assyrians in the Near East.</summary>
