    "text": "Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the forcible assault upon the democratically elected Government of Cambodia is illegal and constitutes a military coup. Calls for the administration to immediately invoke provisions of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 prohibiting the use of funds provided by such Act to finance assistance to any country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by military coup. Calls for the authorities in Cambodia to take immediate steps to halt all extralegal violence and to restore civil, political, and personal liberties. Calls for the United States to: (1) release the report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning the March 30, 1997, grenade attack in Phnom Penh; (2) declassify and release all Drug Enforcement Agency reports related to Cambodia that were compiled between 1994 and the present; (3) press Cambodian authorities to investigate all abuses and extralegal actions that have occurred in Cambodia since July 4, 1997, and bring those responsible to justice; (4) request an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider all options to restore peace in Cambodia; (5) encourage the Secretary General of the United Nations to expand the monitoring operations of the United Nations Special Representative on Human Rights in Cambodia; (6) coordinate efforts with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to restore democracy, stability, and the rule of law in Cambodia; (7) continue to suspend direct U.S. assistance to Cambodia until violence ends, a democratically elected government is reconstituted, necessary steps have been taken to ensure that the election scheduled for 1998 takes place in a free and fair manner, the military is depoliticized, and the judiciary is made independent; (8) redirect at least a substantial share of previously appropriated assistance to Cambodia to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees and displaced persons in western Cambodia through nongovernmental agencies or through Cambodian civilian, political, or military forces that are opposing the coup; and (9) call for an emergency meeting of the Donors' Consultative Group for Cambodia to encourage the suspension of assistance as part of a multilateral effort to encourage respect for democratic processes, constitutionalism, and the rule of law."
