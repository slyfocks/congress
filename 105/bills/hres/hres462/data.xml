      <text>Point of order raised by Mr. Nadler on the content of the measure. Mr. Nadler stated that the resolution violated Sec. 425(a) of the Congressional Budget Act which relates to the Unfunded Mandates Provisions. The Chair ruled that Mr. Nadler's point of order achieved the threshold required under the rule because the language on which the point of order was based was specified by Mr. Nadler within the text of the resolution. The House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate on the point of order which will be followed by a vote on the question of consideration of the resolution.</text>
