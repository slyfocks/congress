  <summary>4/24/1997--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the 105th Congress should not consider any proposal for reducing benefits under the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Program under title II of the Social Security Act; and (2) the Congress should consider neither proposals for arbitrary reductions in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) nor proposals for any transfer of the responsibility for establishing, maintaining, or adjusting the CPI to an outside, politically appointed commission, but rather should ensure that the accuracy and integrity of the CPI continue to be maintained by the professional economists of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Department of Labor.</summary>
