Prohibits: (1) any treaty from authorizing or permitting any foreign power or any international organization to supervise, control, or adjudicate rights of U.S. citizens enumerated in the Constitution or other matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States or the several States; and (2) any decision of any international body purporting to interpret treaties to which the United States is a party from being given any precedential effect by Federal or State courts in any proceeding concerning such matters. Requires the enactment of appropriate legislation by the Congress before a treaty becomes effective as internal law in the United States."
