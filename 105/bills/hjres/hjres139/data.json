Declares that, by his signature on this Act, William Jefferson Clinton acknowledges this censure and condemnation and voluntarily undertakes and binds himself to: (1) make a donation of $500,000 to the Treasury; (2) not deliver in person any State of the Union address; (3) not be involved in fund raising activities for the Democratic Party or for any candidate for public office; and (4) not serve in public office after his term as President is completed."
