  <summary>12/17/1998--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that William Jefferson Clinton violated the trust of the American people, lied under oath concerning his conduct with a subordinate, wrongly took steps to delay discovery of the truth, remains subject to criminal and civil penalties, and has brought upon himself the censure and condemnation of the American people and the Congress. Declares that, by his signature on this Act, William Jefferson Clinton acknowledges this censure and condemnation and voluntarily undertakes and binds himself to: (1) make a donation of $500,000 to the Treasury; (2) not deliver in person any State of the Union address; (3) not be involved in fund raising activities for the Democratic Party or for any candidate for public office; and (4) not serve in public office after his term as President is completed.</summary>
