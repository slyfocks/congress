  <summary>3/4/1998--Introduced.
Disapproves the President's determination contained in the foreign assistance certification submitted to the Congress on February 26, 1998, that Mexico has cooperated fully with the United States to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives established by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Waives requirements of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to withhold U.S. assistance and to vote against multilateral development bank assistance to Mexico until March 1, 1999, if at any time after this Act's enactment the President submits to the Congress a determination and certification that vital U.S. national interests so require.</summary>
