Declares that the Congress supports the existing Federal legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs and opposes efforts to circumvent this process by legalizing marijuana, and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use without valid scientific evidence and Food and Drug Administration approval. Directs the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, regarding specified years, on: (1) the total quantity of marijuana eradicated in the United States; and (2) the annual number of arrests and prosecutions for Federal marijuana offenses. Requires the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to report to specified congressional committees on the specific efforts underway to enforce specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding marijuana and other Schedule I drugs.</summary>
