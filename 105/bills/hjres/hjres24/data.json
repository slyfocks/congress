    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Requires the Congress, before each fiscal year, to adopt a statement in which total Federal outlays (except those for repayment of debt principal) do not exceed total receipts (except those derived from borrowing) , unless a three-fifths vote of both Houses authorizes a specific excess. Prohibits a bill to increase receipts from becoming law unless approved by a three-fifths majority in each House. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget. Authorizes the Congress to waive these provisions when: (1) a declaration of war is in effect; or (2) the United States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security, as declared by a joint resolution adopted by a majority of each House. Sets a permanent limit on the amount of Federal public debt, prohibiting any increase unless legislation enacted by a three-fifths majority of both Houses become law. Requires roll call votes in the House and Senate under this amendment."
