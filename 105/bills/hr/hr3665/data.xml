  <summary>4/1/1998--Introduced.
Battered Women's Shelters and Services Act - Amends the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act to mandate that State grant applications document specific involvement in application development of the State domestic violence coalition and other knowledgeable individuals and interested organizations. Revises minimum fund allotment and proportionality guidelines. Cites circumstances under which the Secretary of Health and Human Services may award grants to nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations for technical assistance and training initiatives for special issue resource centers. Expands such resource centers' specialization areas to include: (1) providing technical assistance and training to local domestic violence programs that provide shelter or related assistance; (2) improving access to services, information, and training within Indian tribes and organizations; and (3) responding to emerging domestic violence issues identified in consultation with advocates representing local shelter or related assistance programs, State domestic violence coalitions, and national domestic violence organizations. Authorizes appropriations. Modifies grant amounts for State coalitions and for State domestic violence coalitions, including: (1) model leadership grants for domestic violence intervention in underserved communities; (2) direct emergency assistance; and (3) technical assistance and training for State and local domestic violence programs. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2003 for family violence prevention and services.</summary>
