  <summary>7/31/1998--Passed Senate amended.
Amends the Fastener Quality Act to exempt from certain testing and certification requirements fasteners specifically manufactured or altered for use on an aircraft if the quality and suitability of those fasteners for that use has been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Declares that such exemption shall not apply to fasteners represented by the fastener manufacturer as having been manufactured in conformance with standards or specifications established by a consensus standards organization or a Federal agency other than the FAA. Declares that regulations issued under such Act by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on April 14, 1998 (including any other regulations issued by them), shall not take effect until after the later of June 1, 1999, or 120 days after the Secretary of Commerce reports to specified congressional committees on: (1) changes in fastener manufacturing processes that have occurred since enactment of the Act; (2) a comparison of the Act to other regulatory programs that regulate the various categories of fasteners, and an analysis of any duplication that exists among programs; and (3) any further revisions to the Act that may be warranted because of such reported changes.</summary>
