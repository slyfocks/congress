Requires the local government receiving the grant to match for the fiscal year: (1) ten percent of the Federal funds, if the local government represents a community of 25,000 residents or fewer; (2) 15 percent of the Federal funds, if the local government represents a community of more than 25,000 but not more than 100,000 residents; and (3) 25 percent of the Federal funds, if the local government represents a community of more than 100,000 residents. Requires the Administrator to ensure that grants are made to local governments representing communities of each size described above for which there are eligible applicants. Specifies the use of such grants and limits administrative costs of grant recipients to ten percent of the total amount of the grant. Requires the recipients to report to the Administrator, with respect to each fiscal year a grant was received, on the use of the grant. Authorizes appropriations."
