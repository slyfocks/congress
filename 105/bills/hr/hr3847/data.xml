  <summary>5/12/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to prohibit the transfer or assignment of leased marketing premises during the franchise term unless the franchisor has first: (1) made a bona fide offer to the franchisee at least 45 days before the proposed transfer or assignment; or (2) offered the right of first refusal (of at least 45 days' duration) to the franchisee regarding an offer made by another to acquire the franchisor's interest in the premises. Declares that it shall be a violation of the Act for a refiner or distributor to fix or maintain motor fuel retail prices at a retail outlet supplied by that refiner or distributor, unless such outlet is also operated by the refiner or distributor.</summary>
