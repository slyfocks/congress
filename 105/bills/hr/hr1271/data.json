Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish a grant program to utilize undergraduate and technical colleges, including historically black colleges and Hispanic serving institutions, in research on subjects of relevance to the FAA. Sets forth criteria for the award of such grants. Authorizes appropriations for such grants. Requires the Administrator to provide notice to specified congressional committees no later than 30 days before any major reorganization of any FAA program for which funds are authorized by this Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the FAA should: (1) give priority to correcting all two-digit date-related problems in its computer systems to ensure its continued operation in the year 2000 and beyond; and (2) develop contingency plans for FAA systems it is unable to correct in time."
