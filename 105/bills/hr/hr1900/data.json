    "text": "Depository Institution Consumer Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require each Federal banking agency to prescribe consumer protection regulations pertaining to the sales, solicitations, advertising, or offers of a nondeposit product by a retail depository institution (including its affiliates, subsidiaries, and persons engaged in such activities at an institution office, or on its behalf). Encompasses within the ambit of such regulations: (1) anticoercion sales and product marketing rules; (2) product suitability; (3) mandatory disclosure of the non-insured and non-guaranteed status of a nondeposit product, including investment risks; (4) prohibition of misrepresentation; (5) physical segregation of banking and nonbanking activities; (6) sales personnel qualification requirements and training; and (7) the structuring of compensation programs with respect to nondeposit product referral or sales incentives. Directs Federal banking regulators to jointly establish a consumer enforcement mechanism for expeditious consumer complaint resolution. Proscribes the use of a deposit institution name or logo in connection with a nondeposit product serviced by such institution. Sets forth safeguards relating to confidential consumer financial information."
