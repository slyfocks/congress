Independent Commission on Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1998 - Establishes the Independent Commission on Campaign Finance Reform to study the laws relating to the financing of political activity and to report and recommend legislation to reform those laws. (Sec. 6) Requires the Commission, not later than the expiration of the 180-day period that begins on the date on which the second session of the 105th Congress adjourns, to submit to the President, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, a report of the activities of the Commission. Requires the report to include any recommendations for changes in the laws (including regulations) governing the financing of political activity, including any changes in House and Senate rules, to which nine or more Commission members may agree, together with drafts of: (1) any legislation recommended by the Commission to implement such recommendations; and (2) any proposed amendment to the Constitution recommended by the Commission as necessary to implement such recommendations, except that if the Commission includes such a proposed amendment in its report, it shall also include recommendations and drafts for legislation that may be implemented prior to the adoption of such proposed amendment. Requires the Commission, in making recommendations and preparing drafts of legislation, to consider the following to be its primary goals: (1) encouraging fair and open Federal elections that provide voters with meaningful information about candidates and issues; (2) eliminating the disproportionate influence of special interest financing of Federal elections; and (3) creating a more equitable electoral system for challengers and incumbents. (Sec. 7) Provides for expedited congressional consideration of any legislation introduced the substance of which implements a recommendation of the Commission submitted, including a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
