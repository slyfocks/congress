(Current law sets the maximum at $4,500 for academic year 1997-1998.) Makes available to the Secretary of Education, from funds not otherwise appropriated, specified maximum amounts for certain fiscal years for the payment of Pell grants. Authorizes the Secretary, if such amount made available in a fiscal year is not sufficient to pay all Pell grants, to make such reductions in awards as may be necessary, by either a fixed or variable percentage reduction or by a fixed dollar reduction."
