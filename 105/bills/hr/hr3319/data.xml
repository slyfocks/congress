  <summary>3/4/1998--Introduced.
Land Owners' Notification Act of 1998 - Requires a private nongovernmental entity, on the date that it files an application for a certificate, license, permit, or other authorization under a Federal eminent domain authorization statute, to make a good faith effort to notify by certified mail any person who is the owner of any interest in property which may be subject to the exercise of eminent domain under such statute. Prohibits construing anything in this Act as modifying or superseding any law that requires actual notice by certified mail to be timely provided to any affected owner, including any notice required under the Federal Power Act.</summary>
