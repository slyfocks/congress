Directs the Attorney General to designate an office in the Department of Justice: (1) to which such disclosures shall be made; and (2) which shall make such names public. Title II: Provisions Applicable To United States Banking Institutions - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the International Banking Act of 1978 to prohibit insured depository institutions and foreign bank-controlled commercial lending companies (with a limited exception for affiliates of foreign insurance companies) from engaging in specified financial transactions with or on behalf of a foreign insurance company listed under title I (including any affiliate) during a specified period until the Attorney General publishes in the Federal Register that such company has complied with the disclosure requirements of this Act."
