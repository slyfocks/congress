  <summary>9/14/1998--Introduced.
Prescription Drug Patient Choice Act of 1998 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan (and a health insurance issuer offering group coverage) that covers prescription drugs when the drugs are furnished through network providers to also offer the option of coverage of prescription drugs when furnished through non-network providers. Prohibits higher premiums, copayments, or deductibles or lower reimbursement for drugs through non-network providers. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply the above requirements to issuers in the individual market. Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require health maintenance organizations, competitive medical plans, State Medicaid plans, issuers of Medicare supplemental policies, and Medicare select policies to meet the requirements of this Act. Amends Federal law relating to health benefits for Federal employees to require compliance with this Act.</summary>
