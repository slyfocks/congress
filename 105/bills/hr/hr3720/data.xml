  <summary>4/23/1998--Introduced.
English for the Children Act - Repeals the Bilingual Education Act (BEA). Terminates the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs in the Department of Education. Repeals specified provisions of the Department of Education Organization Act relating to such Office. Directs the Secretary of Education, at the end of a specified transition period, to deposit in the Treasury any funds that have not been awarded or obligated for BEA grants. Requires completion of the most recent school year that commences after enactment of this Act before a BEA program is terminated. Authorizes the Secretary, during the one year period after such enactment, to assist local educational agencies in the transition of children enrolled in BEA programs to special alternative instructional programs that do not make use of the student's native language. Declares that this Act shall not: (1) preempt any State law; or (2) be construed as requiring that a State or local educational agency develop, implement, provide, or maintain a program of bilingual education. Voids any consent decree with either the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or the Department of Education that requires a State, locality, or local educational agency to develop, implement, provide, or maintain any form of bilingual education.</summary>
