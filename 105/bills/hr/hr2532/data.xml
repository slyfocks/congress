Health Insurance Access Amendments of 1997 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to decrease, in three steps over two years, the period during which a group health plan (and a health insurer offering group coverage) may impose a preexisting condition exclusion. (Sec. 3) Amends PHSA provisions relating to guaranteed availability of individual coverage to individuals with prior group coverage to decrease, in three steps over two years, the required aggregate of periods of creditable coverage. (Sec. 4) Amends provisions relating to guaranteed availability of coverage for employers in the group market to: (1) increase, over two years, the applicability of provisions relating to the small group market and small employers (currently defined as having two to 50 employees) first to include employers with up to 100 employees, then to all employers; and (2) remove provisions relating to assuring access in the large group market. Expands the applicability of provisions relating to disclosure of information by insurers to employers, first including employers with up to 100 employees, then including all employers.</summary>
