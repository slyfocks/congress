  <summary>3/12/1998--Introduced.
Disabled Children's Fairness Act of 1998 - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act with respect to disability eligibility redeterminations for SSI recipients who attain age 18. Repeals the requirement for application of the criteria used in determining the initial eligibility for individuals who are age 18 or older. Requires the application of medical improvement and other current law standards previously not applied in SSI disability eligibility redeterminations for 18-year-olds. Provides for expanded use of dedicated savings account funds for food, clothing, shelter, utility, and personal items for disabled children. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to provide reasonable notice and, upon request, opportunity for a hearing and review to an eligible individual or representative payee who disagrees with any expense disallowance with regard to such an account. Makes this Act applicable to expenditures made before, on, or after the enactment of this Act.</summary>
