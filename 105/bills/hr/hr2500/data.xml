TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Consumer Bankruptcy Issues Title II: Improved Bankruptcy Administration Responsible Borrower Protection Bankruptcy Act - Title I: Consumer Bankruptcy Issues - Amends Federal bankruptcy law to prescribe guidelines for a needs-based bankruptcy system which precludes individuals from filing for complete relief in bankruptcy (under chapter 7 (Liquidation)) if certain current monthly income is available to pay creditors. (Sec. 101) Sets forth formulae for income levels determinative of debtor eligibility for bankruptcy relief. Treats as having income available to pay creditors (and thus eligible for chapter 13 Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income) any individual (or in a joint case, an individual and spouse combined) with: (1) a current monthly total income of 75 percent of the national median household income for one earner (or 75 percent of the national median family income for a family of equal size); (2) projected monthly net income greater than $50; and (3) projected monthly net income sufficient to repay 20 percent or more of unsecured non-priority claims during a five-year repayment plan. (Sec. 102) Provides for adjustment to a chapter 13 debtor's monthly net income for extraordinary circumstances such as loss of income or unusual expenses. (Sec. 103) Modifies notice requirements to apprise a consumer debtor of alternatives to bankruptcy, including independent non-profit debt counseling services. (Sec. 104) Declares embezzlement or fraudulently-incurred debts of individuals nondischargeable in bankruptcy. (Sec. 105) Instructs the bankruptcy court to confirm the bankruptcy plan of an individual if it provides that the holder of a secured allowed claim retains the lien securing such claim until discharge of all debts. (Sec. 106) Grants a claim arising from a nondischargeable debt incurred to pay a Federal tax (or any other nondischargeable debt) the same priority as the claim for the underlying obligation which was paid for by such nondischargeable debt. (Sec. 107) Establishes a presumption that consumer debts owed to a single creditor and incurred within 90 days prior to an order for relief in bankruptcy are nondischargeable in bankruptcy. (Sec. 108) Revamps prescriptions governing the effects of conversion from chapter 13 to another chapter. Declares that: (1) valuations of property and of allowed secured claims in a chapter 13 case shall not apply in a chapter 7 case; and (2) with respect to cases converted from chapter 13, the claim of any creditor holding security as of the date of the petition shall continue to be secured by that security unless the full amount of that claim determined under applicable non-bankruptcy law has been paid in full as of the date of conversion. (Sec. 109) Terminates the automatic stay 30 days after filing of a petition if a petition was pending and dismissed under chapter 7 the previous year, unless the subsequent filing is in good faith. Delineates conditions under which a history of previous petitions in bankruptcy give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the case is not filed in good faith. (Sec. 110) Requires that the value of personal property collateral be at least equal to the outstanding balance of the purchase price, including interest and charges, where the property was acquired by the debtor within 180 days of filing the petition in bankruptcy. (Sec. 111) Declares that, in the case of chapter 7 and chapter 13 debtors, the personal property securing the individual debtor's personal property shall be the replacement value as of the date the petition is filed without deduction for costs of sale or marketing. (Sec. 112) Modifies debtor's duties to mandate specified affirmative actions to be taken by a chapter 7 debtor, including reaffirmation of the debt or redemption of the property within 60 days, in order to retain possession of personal property. (Sec. 113) Establishes the Bankruptcy Exemption Study Commission to study and report to the Congress on issues and problems in the bankruptcy system, including whether exemptions should be uniform nationally, and the appropriate size of exemptions in individual cases. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 114) Mandates that a chapter 13 debtor file a bankruptcy plan within a specified deadline. (Sec. 115) Changes from discretionary to mandatory the court's authority to dismiss an individual debtor case if relief would be a substantial abuse of chapter 7. Requires the court to find that substantial abuse exists if: (1) the debtor is ineligible for chapter 7 relief under the needs-based test; or (2) the totality of the circumstances of the debtor's financial situation demonstrate substantial abuse. (Sec. 116) Provides for a chapter 7 debtor's assumption of executory contracts and unexpired leases. Declares that in a chapter 11 case in which the debtor is an individual, and in a chapter 13 case, if the lease is not assumed in the plan, it is rejected (and no longer subject to an automatic stay) as of the plan's confirmation date.
