Requires nondesignated insurers to submit to the Secretary their annual total exposure units (in car and house years) of policies in a designated line sold in their MSA. Exempts insurers in States with substantially similar disclosure provisions from such requirements. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide for specification of collected data; and (2) implement a public access system to such insurance information. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to designate: (1) MSAs for which reporting is required; and (2) insurers. Sets forth the following insurance lines requiring reporting: (1) automobile insurance; (2) homeowners insurance; (3) dwelling fire insurance; (4) small business insurance; and (5) surety bonds. (Authorizes the Secretary to designate additional insurance lines.) (Sec. 5) Sets forth disclosure requirements for rejected insurance applicants. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to establish a task force on insurance agency appointments which shall: (1) review and recommend solutions to improve inner city and minority insurance agents' ability to market insurance products, including steps to increase minority appointments. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to annually collect and make available to the public insurance data from each designated MSA. (Sec. 10) Sets forth civil and injunctive remedies for agent violations of this Act. (Sec. 11) Terminates this Act five years from its effective date (with a two-year discretionary extension). (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to conduct studies of: (1) insurance applicants; (2) insurer actions to meet needs of minority and low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, including small businesses; (3) disparate claim treatment; (4) territory rating; and (5) reinvestment requirements."
