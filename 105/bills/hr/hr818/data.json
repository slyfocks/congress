Prohibits an employer from requiring that more than ten percent of employee contributions (elective salary deferrals) to the 401(k) plan be invested in such employer securities and real property. Exempts from the ten percent limit any plan that permits participating employees to determine whether to be invested in such employer securities and real property (thus leaving such employees free to assume the risk of undiversified investment in their employer). Provides for protection of employees assuming such risk by the application of the same prohibited transaction rules that apply to traditional defined benefit pension plans."
