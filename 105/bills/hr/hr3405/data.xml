  <summary>3/5/1998--Introduced.
Amends the National School Lunch Act, with respect to the child and adult care food program, to revise eligibility requirements for private organizations providing nonresidential day care services to require only that at least 25 percent of the children served by it meet the income eligibility criteria for free or reduced price meals. (Current law limits institutional eligibility to an organization receiving compensation under title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) of the Social Security Act for at least 25 percent of its enrolled children or 25 percent of its licensed capacity, whichever is less.)</summary>
