Authorizes the Secretary to convey a remaining fractional interest in such Project to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, pursuant to a specified memorandum of understanding. Provides for: (1) the transfer of certain inundated lands along the Dam and Reservoir; and (2) appropriate administrative jurisdiction over such lands after such transfer. Requires the conveyance under this Act to occur promptly after the completion of specified events, including compliance with applicable environmental laws, issuance of a statement by the Ute Tribe that their trust assets have been protected, and development of a flood control plan by the Secretary of the Army which shall direct the District in the operation of the Vallecito Dam for such purpose. Directs the Secretary, if the transfer is not substantially completed, to report to specified congressional committees within 18 months after the enactment of this Act on the transfer's status, obstacles, and anticipated completion date."
