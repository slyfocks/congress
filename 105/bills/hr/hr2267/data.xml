  <summary>12/2/1997--Line item veto by President.
(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On December 2, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel $5 million in discretionary budget authority for one item included in this Act: a cooperative agreement with Montana State University for a research program on green buildings out of funds provided for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The following revised digest summarizes the enacted version of H.R. 2267 as modified by line item veto.) (Note: The high degree of specificity of the item cancelled precluded its inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item veto are identical. For more information on the specific item vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2267, H. Rept. 105-405, and Presidential Cancellation Number 97-82.))

(Sec. 112) Philippine Army, Scouts, and Guerilla Veterans of World War II Naturalization Act of 1997 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 with respect to the naturalization of certain Philippine World War II veterans.

(Sec. 115) Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to repeal a requirement that a person required to register as a sex offender do so with a designated State law enforcement agency. Requires that a determination of whether a person is a sexually violent predator be made by a court after considering the recommendation of a board composed of experts in the behavior and treatment of sex offenders, victims' rights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement agencies. Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) waive such requirement upon determining that the State has established alternative procedures or legal standards for designating a person as a sexually violent predator; and (2) approve alternative measures of comparable or greater effectiveness in protecting the public from unusually dangerous or recidivistic sexual offenders. Modifies requirements regarding release, parole, supervised release, and probation of such persons to require specified actions by the court or another responsible officer or official, including reporting address changes as provided by State law. Directs the court or such officer or official to inform the person that: (1) if the person changes residence to another State, the person must report the change of address as provided by State law and comply with any registration requirement in the new State of residence; and (2) the person must also register in a State where the person is employed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. Revises registration procedures to require that State procedures ensure that: (1) the registration information is promptly made available to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the person expects to reside and is promptly entered into the appropriate State records or data system; (2) conviction data and fingerprints for persons required to register are promptly transmitted to the FBI; (3) the address for persons required to register be verified at least annually; (4) updated address information is promptly made available to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the person will reside and is promptly entered into the appropriate State records or data system; and (5) procedures are in place to accept registration information from persons who were convicted in another State, convicted of a Federal offense, or sentenced by a court martial, and from nonresident offenders who have crossed into another State to work or attend school. Directs States to participate in the national sex offender registry database in accordance with guidelines issued by the Attorney General. Includes independent contractors acting at the direction of law enforcement agencies within the scope of provisions granting immunity for good faith conduct. Amends the Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 to: (1) direct that States be allowed a specified time frame to establish minimally sufficient sexual offender registration programs; and (2) make related Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 provisions effective at the conclusion of such time frame. Extends registration requirements to sex offenders convicted in Federal or military courts. Requires such offenders to register in accordance with the laws of the States in which they reside. Requires Federal and military authorities to ensure that such offenders are notified of the registration obligation. Authorizes the Attorney General to protect the confidentiality of the identity and location of persons subject to registration requirements as convicted offenders under Federal or State law, including prescribing alternative procedures to those otherwise provided by Federal or State law for registration and tracking of such persons. Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State should have in effect a law that makes it a crime to stalk any individual, especially children, without requiring that such individual be physically harmed or abducted before a stalker is restrained or punished. Grants States three years from the date of enactment to implement amendments made by this Act which impose new requirements, with two-year extensions authorized for States making good faith efforts to implement such amendments. (Sec. 116) Amends the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 to increase the number of visas set aside under a specified pilot program for immigrants seeking to enter the United States for purposes of engaging in a new commercial enterprise. Extends such program. (Sec. 117) Requires the Attorney General to provide a magnetometer and guards at specified real property leased to the Federal Government in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

(Sec. 121) Directs the Attorney General to submit to the Congress a plan to require sex offenders, prior to release from Federal custody following a conviction for a criminal offense against a minor or a sexually violent offense, to provide DNA samples to the appropriate law enforcement agency for inclusion in a national law enforcement DNA database. (Sec. 122) Authorizes the FBI Director, for a three-year period and with the approval of the Attorney General, to establish a personnel management system providing for the compensation and performance management of up to 3,000 non-special agent employees to fill specified critical positions. Sets forth reporting and evaluation requirements with respect to such system. Grants the Secretary of the Treasury the same authority provided to the Office of Personnel Management to establish three-year demonstration projects to fill specified critical positions. (Sec. 123) Authorizes the court to postpone the effective date of an automatic stay of prospective relief subject to a pending motion to modify or terminate relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions for up to 60 days for good cause.

Declares that it shall be the duty of a district court hearing an action under this section and the Supreme Court to advance on the docket and expedite the disposition of any such matter. Permits executive branch agencies authorized to carry out a census to obtain a declaratory judgment respecting whether or not the use of a statistical method to determine the population for purposes of apportionment or redistricting of Members in Congress is forbidden by the Constitution and U.S. law. Authorizes the Speaker of the House of Representatives to commence or join in a civil action to prevent the use of any statistical method in connection with the decennial census.
