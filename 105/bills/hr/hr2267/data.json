    "as": "Line item veto by President", 
    "date": "1997-12-02", 
    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On December 2, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel $5 million in discretionary budget authority for one item included in this Act: a cooperative agreement with Montana State University for a research program on green buildings out of funds provided for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The following revised digest summarizes the enacted version of H.R. 2267 as modified by line item veto.) (Note: The high degree of specificity of the item cancelled precluded its inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item veto are identical. For more information on the specific item vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2267, H. Rept. 105-405, and Presidential Cancellation Number 97-82.))

(Sec. 115) Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to repeal a requirement that a person required to register as a sex offender do so with a designated State law enforcement agency. Requires that a determination of whether a person is a sexually violent predator be made by a court after considering the recommendation of a board composed of experts in the behavior and treatment of sex offenders, victims' rights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement agencies.

Modifies requirements regarding release, parole, supervised release, and probation of such persons to require specified actions by the court or another responsible officer or official, including reporting address changes as provided by State law. Directs the court or such officer or official to inform the person that: (1) if the person changes residence to another State, the person must report the change of address as provided by State law and comply with any registration requirement in the new State of residence; and (2) the person must also register in a State where the person is employed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. Revises registration procedures to require that State procedures ensure that: (1) the registration information is promptly made available to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the person expects to reside and is promptly entered into the appropriate State records or data system; (2) conviction data and fingerprints for persons required to register are promptly transmitted to the FBI; (3) the address for persons required to register be verified at least annually; (4) updated address information is promptly made available to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction where the person will reside and is promptly entered into the appropriate State records or data system; and (5) procedures are in place to accept registration information from persons who were convicted in another State, convicted of a Federal offense, or sentenced by a court martial, and from nonresident offenders who have crossed into another State to work or attend school.

Requires Federal and military authorities to ensure that such offenders are notified of the registration obligation. Authorizes the Attorney General to protect the confidentiality of the identity and location of persons subject to registration requirements as convicted offenders under Federal or State law, including prescribing alternative procedures to those otherwise provided by Federal or State law for registration and tracking of such persons. Expresses the sense of the Congress that each State should have in effect a law that makes it a crime to stalk any individual, especially children, without requiring that such individual be physically harmed or abducted before a stalker is restrained or punished. Grants States three years from the date of enactment to implement amendments made by this Act which impose new requirements, with two-year extensions authorized for States making good faith efforts to implement such amendments. (Sec. 116) Amends the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 to increase the number of visas set aside under a specified pilot program for immigrants seeking to enter the United States for purposes of engaging in a new commercial enterprise.

(Sec. 122) Authorizes the FBI Director, for a three-year period and with the approval of the Attorney General, to establish a personnel management system providing for the compensation and performance management of up to 3,000 non-special agent employees to fill specified critical positions. Sets forth reporting and evaluation requirements with respect to such system. Grants the Secretary of the Treasury the same authority provided to the Office of Personnel Management to establish three-year demonstration projects to fill specified critical positions. (Sec. 123) Authorizes the court to postpone the effective date of an automatic stay of prospective relief subject to a pending motion to modify or terminate relief in civil actions regarding prison conditions for up to 60 days for good cause.
