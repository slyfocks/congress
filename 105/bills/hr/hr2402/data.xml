Water-Related Technical Corrections Act of 1997 - Amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 to reduce (from 60 to 30 days after the Secretary of the Interior has transmitted a report on an existing dam to the Congress) the required waiting period before the obligation of reclamation funds provided under such Act. Amends the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 to direct the Secretary to participate in the planning, design, and construction of the: (1) Albuquerque Metropolitan Area Water Reclamation and Reuse Project; and (2) Phoenix Metropolitan Water Reclamation and Reuse Project. Adds as a purpose of the Albuquerque project to reclaim and use nonpotable surface water in the Albuquerque metropolitan area. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to refund all amounts received by the United States as collections under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 for charges that were assessed for failure to file certain certification or reporting forms. Allows certain administrative fees to be retained. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Amends the Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1996 to extend the period of contract repayment for: (1) the city of Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Nueces River Authority under the Nueces River reclamation project, Texas; and (2) the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority under the Canadian River reclamation project, Texas. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts with the Solano County Water Agency, or any of its member unit contractors for water from the Solano Project, California, pursuant to the Act of February 21, 1911 (subject to a limitation on the portion of the Project that may be used) for: (1) the impounding, storage, and carriage of nonproject water for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other beneficial purposes, using any facilities associated with the Project; and (2) the exchange of water among Project contractors for such purposes, using facilities associated with the Project. (Sec. 8) Amends the Act of December 29, 1950, authorizing construction, operation, and maintenance of the Canadian River reclamation project, Texas, to direct the Secretary to allow use of the project distribution system for transport of water from the Canadian River Conjunctive Use Groundwater Project to municipalities that are receiving water from the project, subject to specified environmental and engineering reviews. Requires the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority to bear the responsibility for all construction, operation, and maintenance costs of the Project and for costs of the environmental review. (Sec. 9) Authorizes the Secretary to use otherwise available amounts to provide up to $2 million in financial assistance to the Medford Irrigation District and the Rogue River Valley Irrigation District for the design and construction of fish passage and protective facilities at North Fork Little Butte Creek Diversion Dam and South Fork Little Butte Creek Diversion Dam in the Rogue River basin, Oregon, if the Secretary determines in writing that these facilities will enhance the fish recovery efforts currently underway at the Rogue River Basin Project, Oregon.</summary>
