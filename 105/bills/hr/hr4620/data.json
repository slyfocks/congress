Provides for such report, if it contains recommendations on the consolidation of such bureaus in a Federal Statistical Service, to incorporate such recommendations in draft legislation and be circulated to the President, the Senate, and the House of Representatives for a period of 30 days. Terminates the Commission upon the expiration of a certain period. Provides for the Commission to become an advisory committee four years after the establishment of a Federal Statistical Service. Directs the Commission to contract with the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration for mutually agreeable expert and consultative services. (Sec. 107) Sets forth provisions for fast-track procedures for a statistical reorganization bill of either House that is substantially identical to the draft legislation submitted to the Congress by the Commission. (Sec. 108) Authorizes appropriations. Title II: Efficiency and Confidentiality of Federal Statistical Systems - Designates Federal Statistical Data Centers. (Sec. 203) Requires, among other things, that Statistical Data Centers: (1) identify opportunities to eliminate duplication and otherwise reduce the reporting burden and cost imposed on the public by the exchange of information for exclusively statistical purposes; and (2) safeguard the confidentiality of identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes. (Sec. 204) Sets limitations on the use and disclosure of data and information by Statistical Data Centers. (Sec. 205) Sets forth provisions for the disclosure of data or information by Federal agencies to one or more Statistical Data Centers for exclusively statistical purposes. (Sec. 206) Authorizes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), after consultation with the head of an agency proposing a reorganization that eliminates, or substantially alters the mission or functions of, an agency designated as a Statistical Data Center, to designate an agency or unit to serve as a successor Statistical Data Center under the terms of this title if certain criteria are met. (Sec. 207) Provides for coordination and oversight of confidentiality and disclosure policies by the Director. Requires: (1) the head of each Statistical Data Center to report to OMB each disclosure agreement and the results of any review of information security undertaken at the request of OMB and any similar review undertaken on the initiative of the Statistical Data Center or an agency supplying data or information to such a Center; and (2) the Director to include a summary of all such reports and any actions taken by the Director in the annual report by OMB to the Congress on statistical programs. (Sec. 210) Directs the President to submit to the Congress, no later than the date that is 90 days after the enactment of this Act, any additional changes in law necessary to reflect the provisions of this Act."
