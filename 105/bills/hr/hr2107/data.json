    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On November 20, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel up to $6.2 million in discretionary budget authority for the following two items included in this Act: (1) the Franklin County Dam in Mississippi; and (2) a conveyance of Federal mineral rights to the State of Montana. The following revised digest summarizes the enacted version of H.R. 2107 as modified by the line item veto.) (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2107, H.Rept. 105-337, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-75 and 97-76.))
