    "text": "Cruise America Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to issue to an owner or operator a certificate of documentation with coastwise endorsement for up to three cruise ships of specified tonnage and passenger capacity which were not built or rebuilt in the United States. Makes a cruise ship with such a certificate eligible for a certificate of inspection if the Secretary determines that: (1) the cruise ship is classed by and designed in accordance with the rules of a classification society accepted by the Secretary; and (2) the cruise ship complies with applicable international agreements and associated guidelines, including being equipped with automatic sprinkler and fire detection systems that meet certain standards. Authorizes a coastwise qualified U.S.-flag, foreign-built cruise ship to be placed under foreign registry without the approval of the Secretary any time after its certificate of documentation. Requires the Secretary to revoke the coastwise endorsement of such cruise ship when it is placed under foreign registry."
