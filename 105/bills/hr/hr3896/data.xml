  <summary>5/19/1998--Introduced.
Information Technology Partnerships Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make competitive grants to institutions of higher education to establish, oversee, and provide technical assistance to postsecondary information technology education and employment assistance projects. Requires such projects to be implemented by certain types of community-based organizations, or by the institutions receiving the grants. Makes applicants eligible for such project assistance if they have a high school diploma or equivalent. Sets forth requirements for: (1) duties of, and uses of project funds by, institutions of higher education and community-based organizations; (2) project sites; (3) information technology curricula; and (4) minimum enrollment percentages of specified low-income individuals and individuals under age 25. Authorizes grants for implementation of a project solely by institutions of higher education without the participation of community-based organizations; but gives grant award priority to institutions of higher education whose grant applications include an assurance that they will contract with one or more community-based organizations. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
