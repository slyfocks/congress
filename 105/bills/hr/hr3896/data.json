Requires such projects to be implemented by certain types of community-based organizations, or by the institutions receiving the grants. Makes applicants eligible for such project assistance if they have a high school diploma or equivalent. Sets forth requirements for: (1) duties of, and uses of project funds by, institutions of higher education and community-based organizations; (2) project sites; (3) information technology curricula; and (4) minimum enrollment percentages of specified low-income individuals and individuals under age 25. Authorizes grants for implementation of a project solely by institutions of higher education without the participation of community-based organizations; but gives grant award priority to institutions of higher education whose grant applications include an assurance that they will contract with one or more community-based organizations. Authorizes appropriations."
