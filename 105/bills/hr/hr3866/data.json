(Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to undertake a program to perform studies and carry out projects to reduce flood hazards and restore natural functions and values of riverine ecosystems throughout the United States. Outlines cost-sharing requirements. Requires the Secretary to notify the appropriate congressional committees before carrying out a project. Requires independent program review. Provides a per-project limit of $75 million. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2004. (Sec. 5) Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to provide the non-Federal share of the costs of periodic beach nourishment or shore protection projects. (Sec. 6) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1948 to increase to $7 million the maximum amount for small flood control projects. (Sec. 7) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1960 to state that a limitation on funding for the compilation and dissemination of information on floods and flood damage shall not apply to funds voluntarily contributed in order to expand the scope of such services. (Sec. 8) Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 to: (1) extend through FY 2000 the Everglades and South Florida ecosystem restoration program; and (2) allow non-profit entities to enter into agreements to pay non-Federal shares of aquatic ecosystem restoration projects.

(Sec. 11) Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal and non-profit entities to facilitate collaborative efforts for environmental protection and restoration, natural resources, conservation, and recreation in connection with the development, operation, and management of water resources projects. (Sec. 12) Amends the Flood Control Act of 1936 to allow contributions by States and political subdivisions to be used for environmental restoration activities. (Sec. 13) Authorizes the Secretary during FY 1999 through 2002 to withhold a specified amount of recreation user fees for backlogged repair and maintenance projects, interpretation, signage, habitat or facility enhancement, resource preservation, annual operation, maintenance, and law enforcement related to public use at recreation sites. (Sec. 14) Directs the Secretary, within a year after enactment of this Act and every five years thereafter, to review the Shoreline Management Program administered by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) at Army projects to determine Program costs. (Sec. 15) Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 to permit studies undertaken by the Secretary concerning the Pacific region to include flood damage reduction and environmental restoration. (Sec. 16) Establishes the Water Resources Foundation, a nonprofit District of Columbia corporation, to: (1) encourage, accept, and administer gifts of money and property for Corps activities and services in managing natural resources at Army water resources development projects; and (2) undertake and conduct other activities to further the conservation and management of natural, scenic, historic, and recreational resources at such projects. Provides, with respect to the Foundation, for: (1) conflict of interest prohibitions; (2) tax-exempt status; (3) a Board of Directors; (4) corporate powers and obligations; and (5) an authorization of appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001. (Sec. 17) Directs the Secretary to establish and collect fees from applicants for the evaluation of commercial permit applications, the preparation of environmental impact statements in connection with such applications, and the delineation of wetlands for major developments affecting wetlands. Establishes in the Treasury the Army Civil Works Regulatory Program Account for the deposit and expenditure of such fees. (Sec. 18) Authorizes the Secretary to acquire from willing sellers land and property in the vicinity of Pierre, South Dakota, or to floodproof or relocate other property, in order to provide full operational capability for the Missouri River Main Stem dams that are part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin Program. Requires non- Federal interests to pay 35 percent of such costs. (Sec. 19) Directs the Secretary to finalize a report, together with recommendations, identifying a general implementation strategy and overall plan for environmental restoration and protection along the Lower Missouri River between Gavins Point Dam and the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. (Sec. 20) Authorizes the Secretary to permit the non-Federal sponsor for the project for flood control, Moorefield, West Virginia, to pay without interest the remaining non-Federal project cost over a period to be determined by the Secretary, but not to exceed 30 years."
