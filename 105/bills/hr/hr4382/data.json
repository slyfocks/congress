Requires that appeals from certification denials follow procedures in effect at that time (currently, in effect on a specified date). Requires that standards for accreditation bodies: (1) mandate review of clinical images by qualified review physicians (currently, by qualified practicing physicians); and (2) prohibit those conducting reviews from having any relationship (currently, any financial relationship) with the facility being reviewed that would constitute a conflict of interest. Modifies mammogram record retention requirements. Requires that a summary of the written report regarding a mammography be sent directly to the patient (regardless of whether there is a physician of the patient available) in terms easily understood by a lay person. Allows inspection of facilities (currently, certified facilities) for compliance with certification requirements and mammography quality standards (currently, compliance with mammography quality standards). Authorizes a demonstration program under which inspections are conducted less often than the current minimum of annually. Allows inspections to be conducted by a local agency on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Empowers the Secretary to require a facility to notify patients who received mammograms if the Secretary determines the quality was so inconsistent with standards as to present a significant risk to the individual or public health. Authorizes civil money penalties for failure to comply. Allows certificate suspension or revocation for a failure to comply with an accreditation body's requests for records or materials. Modifies requirements for certification suspension before holding a hearing."
