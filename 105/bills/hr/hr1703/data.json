Directs the Secretary to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for Department employees who engage in unlawful employment discrimination, including retaliation against employees asserting equal employment opportunity (EEO) rights. Limits to 40 the number of Department employees whose duties include EEO counseling functions as well as other unrelated functions. Allows such splitting of functions only at Department facilities located in remote geographic locations. Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress reports on the implementation and operation of the EEO system within the Department. Establishes in the Department an Office of Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication headed by a Director who shall be responsible for making final agency decisions on the merits of any unlawful employment discrimination complaints filed by a Department employee. Requires the Director to report to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs when the Director has reason to believe that there has been retaliation against an employee asserting EEO rights. Requires the Director to submit to the Secretary and the Congress reports on the implementation and operation of the Office. Establishes an independent panel to review and report to the veterans' committees on the EEO and sexual harassment practices and procedures within the Department and to make recommendations on improvements."
