Authorizes $5 million out of the Supplemental ESAA for each of FY 2000 through 2003 for expenditures by States whose average civilian labor force populations number less than one million, for: (1) determining whether individuals claiming unemployment compensation under conforming State laws are available to accept suitable work and have not refused suitable work as prescribed by the State unemployment law; (2) job search and placement services to individuals claiming unemployment compensation benefits and other job seekers including counseling, testing, occupational and labor market information, assessment, and referral to employers; and (3) appropriate recruitment services and special technical services for employers. Authorizes, for FY 2004 and thereafter, expenditures out of the Supplemental ESAA by States whose average civilian labor force populations number less than one million, for the same administrative purposes for which expenditures from State ESAAs are authorized.
