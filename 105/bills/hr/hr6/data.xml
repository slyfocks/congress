(Sec. 101) Redesignates the current title XII (General Provisions) as a new HEA title I (and transfers to it the appropriate provisions). Redesignates certain definitions, including "institution of higher education." Requires that a proprietary institution of higher education have at least ten percent of its revenues from sources that are not derived from funds provided under HEA title IV. Repeals specified authority relating to: (1) a commission on postsecondary institutional recognition; (2) certain aggregate limits on authorizations of appropriations; and (3) technology transfer centers. Expresses the sense of the Congress that no student attending an institution of higher education on a full- or part-time basis should, on the basis of protected speech and association, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination or official sanction under any education program, activity, or division directly or indirectly receiving financial assistance under HEA, whether or not such program, activity, or division is sponsored or officially sanctioned by the institution. Terminates at the end of FY 2004 the eligibility for Federal TRIO programs, under HEA title IV, of students from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau. Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) publish the expiration dates of terms of members of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity; and (2) solicit nominations for vacancies on such Committee. Extends such Committee's duration until the end of FY 2004. Collegiate Initiative to Reduce Binge Drinking and Illegal Alcohol Consumption - Expresses the sense of the Congress that, in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all institutions of higher education should: (1) appoint a task force to recommend a broad range of policy and program changes; (2) provide maximum opportunities for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and have alcohol-free recreational and leisure activities; (3) enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal consumption of alcohol by its students; (4) enforce its code of disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol policies, and refer students with alcohol or other drug-related problems for assistance, including to on-campus counseling programs if appropriate; (5) adopt policies to discourage alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus activities and to limit advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on campus; and (6) form an alliance with the local community, including local businesses, to encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and address illegal alcohol use by students. Authorizes the Secretary to make competitive grants to institutions (or consortia of institutions) of higher education, and contracts with such institutions and other organizations, for programs of prevention and education (including treatment-referral) to reduce illegal use of drugs and alcohol and their associated violence. Allows the use of such contracts also for a higher education center for alcohol and drug abuse prevention to provide training, technical assistance, evaluation, dissemination and associated services and assistance to the higher education community. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary to make ten annual National Recognition Awards to institutions of higher education that have developed and implemented effective alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education programs. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth provisions relating to prior rights and responsibilities (including authorization of appropriations) and to recovery of payments under HEA title VII (Construction, Reconstruction, and Renovation of Academic Facilities) (as in effect before title VII is repealed by this Act). Requires the Secretary to: (1) direct the Commissioner of Educational Statistics to convene forums on improvements in market information and public accountability in higher education; and (2) disseminate data that permit review and comparison of cost at individual institutions. Requires the Commissioner to conduct a national study, and report to the appropriate congressional committees, on expenditures at institutions of higher education. Directs the Bureau of Labor Statistics to develop, and report to specified congressional committees on, a higher education market basket that identifies the items that constitute the costs of higher education. Revises certain requirements for the Secretary to survey student aid recipients on a regular cycle. Establishes a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) in the Department of Education as a discrete management unit responsible for managing the operational functions supporting the student financial assistance programs authorized under HEA title IV. Authorizes appropriations. Vests management of the PBO in a Chief Operating Officer (COO) appointed by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary and the COO to develop a five-year performance plan for the PBO, establishing measurable goals and objectives for the organization. Requires the COO to report annually to the Congress through the Secretary. Directs the COO to appoint a Student Loan Ombudsman to provide timely assistance to borrowers of loans made, insured, or guaranteed under HEA title IV by performing specified functions. Requires the PBO to establish an annual performance management system which: (1) maintains individual accountability; and (2) strengthens its organizational effectiveness by providing for establishing goals or objectives for individual, group, or organizational performance, and using performance assessments as a basis for granting employee awards, pay adjustments, and other appropriate personnel actions. Grants the PBO certain procurement flexibility. Directs the Secretary and the COO to encourage and participate in establishing voluntary consensus standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of information necessary for the administration of title IV student assistance programs. Directs the COO to: (1) participate in the activities of such standard setting organizations; and (2) encourage higher education groups seeking to develop common forms, standards, and procedures to do so within such an organization. Directs the Secretary, except with respect to a common financial reporting form, to consider adopting voluntary consensus standards for transactions required under title IV, and common data elements for such transactions, to enable the electronic exchange of information between systems administered by the Department and among participants in the Federal student aid delivery system. Requires any such standard to have been developed by an organization open to the various entities engaged in such delivery system and accredited by the American National Standards Institute. Title II: Teacher Quality - Establishes a new HEA title II Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants for States and Partnerships. (Sec. 201) Provides such teacher quality enhancement grants program to improve: (1) student achievement; (2) preparation of prospective teachers, as well as teacher professional development; (3) accountability of institutions of higher education for teachers' academic knowledge of their subject areas, such as mathematics, science, English, foreign languages, history, economics, art, civics, government, and geography, and training in use of technology in the classroom; and (4) recruitment into the teaching force of highly qualified individuals, including those from other occupations. Allows the use of such grants also for advanced managerial skills training for school principals and superintendents. Provides for competitive grant awards for State and eligible partnership activities, as well as for teacher recruitment. Authorizes the Secretary to award competitive State Grants to eligible States to institute State-level reforms to ensure that current and future teachers possess necessary teaching skills and academic content knowledge in the subject areas in which they are assigned to teach.
