    "as": "Line item veto by President",

    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On October 14, 1997, the President exercised his line item veto authority to cancel $144 million in discretionary budget authority for 13 projects in this Act, including one Air Force operation and maintenance and procurement project, four Army research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) projects, two Navy RDT&E projects, three Air Force RDT&E projects, and three Defense-wide RDT&E projects. The following summary reflects the enacted version of H.R. 2266 as modified by the line item veto cancellations. (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2266, H.Rept. 105-265, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-42 through 97-55.))
