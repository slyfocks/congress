Title II: Emission Reduction Credits - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an emission reduction credit program for natural gas vehicles, Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV)-certified alternative fuel vehicles, and fueling infrastructure. Title III: Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish natural gas vehicle property credits for any of the following property placed in service during the taxable year: (1) natural gas vehicles (50 percent of the cost); (2) fueling stations (the lesser of $25,000 or ten percent of the cost); and (3) transportation fuel (25 cents per gallon of liquefied natural gas plus 25 cents per gasoline gallon equivalent of compressed natural gas). (Sec. 302) Imposes an excise tax of 3.54 cents per gallon on liquefied natural gas sold for use or used as motor vehicle or motorboat fuel unless there was a taxable sale of such gas. (Sec. 303) Provides for shorter depreciation recovery periods for natural gas vehicles (three years) and refueling property (seven years). Title IV: Revision of Purchase Mandates - Declares U.S. policy to be that the low emission vehicle market should be based on voluntary, economically sound decisions, not Federal mandates. (Sec. 402) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to repeal private fleet mandates. Sets forth sunset provisions to end the fuel provider mandate and the State fleet mandate. Title V: Federal Transit Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Amends Federal transportation law to require metropolitan mass transportation planning organizations, in developing plans, to consider opportunities to stimulate the use of natural gas vehicles and ULEV-certified alternative fueled vehicles and the installation of a fueling infrastructure to support such vehicles. (Sec. 504) Declares that research and investigations for which non-profit institutions of higher learning may receive Department of Transportation grants include the relationship between environmental policy and transportation policy, particularly the potential applications for natural gas vehicles and ULEV-certified alternative fueled vehicles in urban settings. (Sec. 505) Requires any Federal grant for a mass transportation project that involves acquiring buses powered by natural gas, or any ULEV-certified alternative fueled bus, and all related fueling property or equipment, to cover at least 90 percent of the project cost. Title VI: Government Contract Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Amends Federal law for Armed Services acquisitions and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Defense and Federal civilian agencies, respectively, to give a preference in procurement contracts to contractors and subcontractors using motor vehicles that: (1) operate on natural gas; or (2) operate on alternative fuel and meet the ULEV standard. Title VII: Research, Development, and Demonstration Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct a five-year program of natural gas vehicle research, development, and demonstration projects, including specified activities. Title VIII: Minimum Distance - Amends Federal transportation law to mandate that the minimum driving range for dual fueled automobiles capable of operating on natural gas shall be 100 miles."
