  <summary>10/29/1997--Introduced.
Brady Background Check Improvement Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to require that background check requests be sent to chief law enforcement officers whose police departments are cooperating in conducting the checks. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) provide to each licensed dealer and cause to have published in the Federal Register a list of chief law enforcement officers certified as cooperating; and (2) periodically publish in the Federal Register and provide to such dealers a list of officers previously certified whom the Secretary determines are no longer the head of a cooperating law enforcement agency. Authorizes a chief law enforcement officer, in the absence of an express provision of State law that prohibits a State or local law enforcement officer from conducting a background check on a handgun purchaser, to make a reasonable effort to ascertain, within five business days after receipt of a notice of the contents of a transferee's statement, whether receipt or possession of the handgun involved would violate the law.</summary>
