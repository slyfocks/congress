Prohibits the Federal Reserve Board and banks from being required to submit strategic plans to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Requires the Director to prepare and submit to the Congress an annual integrated Federal Government performance report which shall include actual results and accomplishments from the previous fiscal year. Sets forth provisions for inspector general review of annual performance plans and annual program performance reports of agencies. Requires the full costs of each program activity to be used as performance indicators with respect to such performance plans. Prohibits the Federal Reserve Board and banks from being required to submit annual performance plans to the Director. Requires the Board and banks to submit to the Congress such performance plans containing the information required, but only with respect to operations and functions that are not directly related to the establishment and conduct of U.S. monetary policy. Prohibits the Board and banks from being required to submit program performance reports to the President. Prohibits the Director from exempting the Council on Environmental Quality from agency requirements of the Act relating to performance plans, program performance reports, and strategic plans. Amends provisions of Federal law enacted by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 to: (1) extend the deadline for agencies to submit the first of annual audited financial statements; and (2) require that such statements be submitted to the Congress (in addition to the Director)."
