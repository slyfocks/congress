    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Child Labor Free Labeling Standards Title II: Child Labor Free Commission Title III: Recognition of Exemplary Corporate Efforts Title IV: Definitions Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1997 - Title I: Child Labor Free Labeling Standards - Directs the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations to ensure that a label using any term or symbol denying the use of child labor does not make a false statement or suggestion that the article or section of wearing apparel or sporting good was not made with child labor. Requires such standards to encourage the use of an easily identifiable symbol or term indicating that the article or section of wearing apparel or sporting good was not made with child labor. (Sec. 101) Requires a producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or other person intending to use any such label to notify the Child Labor Free Commission (CLFC, established under title II of this Act) specified source information. Requires the Commission to review the notification and inform the Secretary, whose permission is required for use of such label. Authorizes the Secretary to charge a fee to cover the CLFC's notification review expenses. Makes it a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) for any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of any article or section of wearing apparel or sporting good that is exported from or offered for sale in the United States to falsely indicate on the label or the packaging, or in the advertising, or otherwise falsely claim or suggest, that the item was not made with child labor. Amends FTCA to prescribe civil penalties for such violations. Establishes in the Treasury the Free the Children Fund for receipt of such penalties. Authorizes annual appropriations from the Fund for educational and other programs to eliminate child labor. Authorizes the CLFC to: (1) develop labeling standards similar to the labeling standards developed for any industry that is not otherwise covered under this Act; and (2) recommend their promulgation to the Secretary, so that this Act and the FTCA shall also apply to the labeling covered by those standards. (Sec. 102) Directs the CLFC to assist the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by reviewing petitions alleging violations of the labeling standards under this Act. Provides, on the basis of CLFC violation reports, for: (1) the Secretary's temporary withdrawal of permission to use such labels; and (2) the FTC's issuance of cease and desist orders.
