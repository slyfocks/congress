    "text": "Utah Wilderness and School Trust Lands Protection Act of 1997 - Designates specified lands originally granted to the State of Utah for the purpose of generating support for the public schools through the development of natural resources as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System upon completion of an exchange of such lands for other Federal lands to be selected by the State as prescribed under this Act. Sets forth provisions governing continuation of existing grazing on such designated lands, Federal water rights for any purpose arising from designation of the areas as wilderness, and nonexclusive access by Native Americans to Native American sites for traditional cultural and religious purposes, including wood gathering and plant collecting. Requires those areas in Utah administered by the Bureau of Land Management which are not designated as wilderness by this Act to be managed for multiple use. Authorizes appropriations."
