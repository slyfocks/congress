Authorizes six-month loan extensions. (Sec. 5) Repeals the temporary suspension of the farmer owned reserve program.

(Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary to transfer specified Department of Agriculture funds to the Farm Service Agency in order to improve local and area Agency services. (Sec. 8) Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to direct the Secretary to carry out a three-year conservation reserve for certain diseased croplands.
