    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1998-07-29", 
    "text": "Video Competition and Consumer Choice Act of 1998 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make the authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate cable television service rates inapplicable to services provided after March 31, 1999, by a cable system unless the franchising authority for such system, after notice and opportunity for a public hearing, certifies to the FCC that the cable operator of such system is not providing subscribers an acceptable range of programming choices to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable. Outlines factors to be considered for such certification. Authorizes FCC review of such certifications. Makes such certifications effective for one year, unless earlier withdrawn or rescinded. Replaces references to \"satellite cable programming\" and \"satellite broadcast programming\" with \"multichannel video programming (MVP).\" Repeals a deadline for FCC regulations concerning the development of competition and diversity in MVP distribution. Outlines minimum requirements for such regulations, including prohibited actions by an MVP vendor with respect to the sale or delivery of such programming among cable systems, cable operators, and other MVP distributors. Prohibits entering into contracts to grant exclusive distribution rights to any person with respect to MVP after the date of enactment of this Act, except for certain exclusivity contracts granted by the FCC in the public interest. Prohibits any such contract (other than the public interest contract) already entered into before such date of enactment to continue after 120 days after such date. Defines MVP as video programming which is transmitted by any means and which is primarily intended for the direct receipt by MVP distributors for retransmission to their subscribers. Requires the revision of MVP regulations as necessitated by this Act within 120 days after enactment. Requires each cable operator of a cable system to make available for sale to its subscribers a separately packaged lifeline service tier consisting exclusively of: (1) FCC-required local commercial television and noncommercial educational television programming; (2) any public, educational, and governmental access programming required by the cable system franchise; and (3) any signal of a local television broadcast station provided by the cable operator to any subscriber (with an exception). Prohibits a cable operator from adding additional video programming signals or services to the lifeline tier. Directs the FCC to prescribe regulations for lifeline tier rates."
