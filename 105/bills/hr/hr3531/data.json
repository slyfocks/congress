    "text": "New Mothers' Breastfeeding Promotion and Protection Act of 1998 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include breastfeeding or expression of milk from the breast to feed a child among those activities for which a woman may not be discriminated against in employment. (Sec. 4) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit for 50 percent of employer expenses for providing an appropriate environment on business premises for employed mothers to breastfeed or express milk for their children. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to put into effect a performance standard for breast pumps irrespective of the class to which the device has been classified under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, identifying those pumps appropriate for use on a regular basis in a place of employment based on the efficiency and effectiveness of the pump and on sanitation factors related to communal use. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to issue a compliance policy guide which will assure that women who want to breastfeed a child are given full and complete information about breast pumps. (Sec. 6) Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), and Federal civil service law, to require family and medical leave for nursing mothers' breaks, if the lactating mothers are entitled to specified leave as private or public employees under such law. Directs the Secretary of Labor to promulgate regulations to implement such FMLA requirement. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary of HHS, acting through the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration and in cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture and other appropriate Federal agency heads, to undertake a campaign aimed at health professionals and the general public to promote the benefits of breastfeeding for infants, mothers, and families, especially public and private health professionals providing health services under Federal programs (including those for Federal employees). (Sec. 8) Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to allow State agencies to use funds made available for food benefits (including savings from infant formula cost containment) for breastfeeding promotion and support activities under the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (the WIC program)."
