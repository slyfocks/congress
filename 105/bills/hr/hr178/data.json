Requires any U.S. person who has a branch or office in Northern Ireland or who controls an enterprise in Northern Ireland in which more than ten people are employed to insure implementation of such employment principles and compliance with this Act. Declares that nothing in this Act shall require quotas or reverse discrimination or mandate their use. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act in the interest of U.S. national security."
