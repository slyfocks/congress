  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices and Principles of Economic Justice Act of 1997 - Prohibits the importation into the United States of an article from Northern Ireland unless documentation is presented at the time of entry indicating that the enterprise which manufactured or assembled such article complied at the time of manufacture with the MacBride Principles of Economic Justice, a nine-point set of guidelines (such as freedom from religious discrimination) for fair employment in Northern Ireland. Requires any U.S. person who has a branch or office in Northern Ireland or who controls an enterprise in Northern Ireland in which more than ten people are employed to insure implementation of such employment principles and compliance with this Act. Declares that nothing in this Act shall require quotas or reverse discrimination or mandate their use. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements of this Act in the interest of U.S. national security.</summary>
