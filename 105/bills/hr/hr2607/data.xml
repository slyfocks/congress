(Sec. 146) Authorizes funds appropriated in this Act to be expended to hire five additional: (1) inspectors for the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs to focus on monitoring day care centers and home day care operations; and (2) Department of Human Services monitors to focus on selecting quality day care centers eligible for public financing and monitoring safety standards at such centers. (Sec. 147) Nation's Capital Bicentennial Designation Act - Designates: (1) the year 2000 as the Year of the National Bicentennial Celebration for Washington, D.C.--the Nation's Capital; and (2) the President's Day holiday as a day of national celebration for the 200th anniversary of the District. (Sec. 150) Amends the District of Columbia Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978 to restrict providers from whom District employees may receive disability compensation services to District government medical officers and hospitals or physicians or managed care organizations approved by the Mayor. (Currently, employees have the option of choosing services by physicians or hospitals approved by the Mayor.) Authorizes District government agency heads, during FY 1998, to identify positions for abolishment. Requires any District employee in such a position, regardless of hiring date, to be separated without competition or assignment rights, except as provided by this section. Entitles an affected employee who, but for this section, would be entitled to compete for retention, to one round of lateral competition limited to positions in the employee's competitive level. Sets forth provisions regarding notification, contests of determinations or separations, and severance pay.

(Sec. 155) Requires District permit or license application forms to include the telephone number established by the District Inspector General for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse. Directs the Inspector General to make quarterly reports to the Congress on the number and nature of calls and on the waste, fraud, and abuse detected as a result of such calls. (Sec. 156) Requires the use of direct deposit or checks through the mail for payments made by the District. (Sec. 157) Amends the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 to require the Secretary of the Treasury, during any control year, to deposit the Federal contribution to the District into an escrow account held by the Authority, which shall allocate such funds to the Mayor. (A control year is any year in which a financial plan and budget approved by the Authority is in effect for periods in which the District is unable to meet certain financial obligations.) Repeals a provision of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that requires heads of Federal agencies and the Architect of the Capitol to provide notice before carrying out activities that affect real property in the District.
