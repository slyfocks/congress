Directs the Secretary to retain title to the Wildlife Mitigation Facilities. Terminates certain prior contracts upon such conveyance. Continues the District's obligation to deliver water to Indian trust lands upon request. Provides liabilities of the District upon conveyance of the irrigation works.
