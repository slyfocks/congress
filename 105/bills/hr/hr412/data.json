Directs the Secretary to retain title to the Wildlife Mitigation Facilities. Terminates certain prior contracts upon such conveyance. Continues the District's obligation to deliver water to Indian trust lands upon request. Provides liabilities of the District upon conveyance of the irrigation works. Terminates upon the completion of the transfer specified mandates imposed upon the irrigation works under prior reclamation laws. Deauthorizes upon completion of the transfer the Chief Joseph Dam Project of the Oroville-Tonasket Unit Extension, Washington."
