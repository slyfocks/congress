Names such grant program the Sex Offender Management Assistance Program (SOMA). Directs that grants awarded be: (1) given directly to the State for distribution to State and local entities; and (2) used for training, salaries, equipment, materials, and other costs directly associated with complying with the Act. Requires a chief executive of a State, to be eligible for such a grant, to submit to the Director annually an application assuring that the State: (1) complies with such Act; and (2) has penalties comparable to or greater than Federal penalties for crimes listed in such Act. Requires the Director to conduct a study to assess the efficacy of SOMA and submit recommendations to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations."
