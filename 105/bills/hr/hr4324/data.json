    "text": "Schools and Libraries Internet Access Act - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to repeal provisions authorizing the Federal Communications Commission to take certain actions to provide access to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health care providers, and libraries. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the excise tax paid for telephone and other communications services to one percent (currently, three percent) of the total paid for such services beginning with bills rendered on or after January 1, 1999, and before October 1, 2003. Repeals such communications taxation provisions with respect to bills rendered on or after October 1, 2003. Establishes in the Treasury the Telecommunications Technology Trust Fund and appropriates into such Fund all amounts received pursuant to the above taxation authority after December 31, 1998. Makes such funds available to carry out provisions of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (NTIAO) as added under this Act. Terminates this section on October 1, 2003. Amends the NTIAO to direct the Secretary of Commerce to award a fiscal year grant to each State having an approved plan for the acquisition of telecommunications and related services for: (1) the provision of health care services by any public or nonprofit health care provider that serves persons residing in a rural area; or (2) elementary and secondary schools and libraries, for educational purposes. Provides for an allocation of State funding based on relative populations. Requires the State plan to take into consideration the relative economic need of the eligible entities, including the number of students living in low-income or sparsely populated areas. Authorizes appropriations from the Fund for FY 1999 through 2003 for such grants and administrative expenses. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2004 and thereafter for such purposes from general Treasury funds."
