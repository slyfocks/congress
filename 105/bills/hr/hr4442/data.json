Sets forth provisions regarding license application requirements, fees, and application approval or denial procedures. Requires that before an unlicensed person transfers a firearm at a gun show, such person shall provide to the holder of the show written notice of: (1) the name, age, and address of such person and of the transferee; (2) the serial number, make, and model of the firearm; and (3) the date and location of the transfer. Requires the holder of the show to: (1) comply with requirements imposed on firearms dealers with respect to firearm transfers; and (2) deliver show records to the Secretary within 30 days after the show. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act."
