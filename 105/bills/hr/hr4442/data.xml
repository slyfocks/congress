  <summary>8/6/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit a person from holding a gun show unless such person is licensed to do so and at least 30 days have elapsed since the person has notified the Secretary of the Treasury and the chief law enforcement officer of the postal address and the dates and times at which the show is to be held. Sets forth provisions regarding license application requirements, fees, and application approval or denial procedures. Requires that before an unlicensed person transfers a firearm at a gun show, such person shall provide to the holder of the show written notice of: (1) the name, age, and address of such person and of the transferee; (2) the serial number, make, and model of the firearm; and (3) the date and location of the transfer. Requires the holder of the show to: (1) comply with requirements imposed on firearms dealers with respect to firearm transfers; and (2) deliver show records to the Secretary within 30 days after the show. Sets forth penalties for violations of this Act.</summary>
