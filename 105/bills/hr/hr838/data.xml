  <summary>2/26/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to revise provisions concerning rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to the use of motorized and nonmotorized river craft on the Snake River within the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area in Oregon and Idaho to: (1) permit such river craft access to, and use of, the entire River within the Area at all times during the year; (2) provide that concurrent use by motorized and nonmotorized river craft shall not be considered a conflict; (3) allow use of the commercial and private river craft to continue on the entire River within the Area throughout each year at levels that optimize the opportunity of the American people to utilize such Area within the reasonable capacity of the resources to sustain that use, recognizing as acceptable established daily and seasonal use patterns and considering the economic well-being of surrounding communities; and (4) allow unrestricted use of such river craft on the River within the Area by owners of private property for traveling to or from their property in their usual and accustomed manner.</summary>
