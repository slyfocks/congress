  <summary>7/9/1997--Introduced.
Telephone Consumer Slamming Prevention Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit telecommunications carriers from submitting or executing a change in a subscriber's selection of an interstate telephone service provider unless the carrier to which the subscriber will be changed has obtained a written change authorization from the subscriber. Makes carriers that violate such requirement liable for fees imposed for changing service to or from the unauthorized carrier and long distance charges incurred by the subscriber during a specified period of unauthorized service. Sets forth conditions under which States may administer a slamming complaint system for subscribers of interstate telephone service. Requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to administer such systems for States that fail to do so. Requires such systems to: (1) make available procedures for registering and maintaining records of complaints by subscribers of unauthorized changes of service; (2) make determinations and maintain records of violations and liability; (3) determine, on a monthly basis, the number of violations involving illegal changes of service for each carrier and provide such information to the FCC; and (4) comply with FCC regulations. Directs carriers providing interstate telephone service to include information on the slamming complaint system in phone bills. Requires the FCC to establish performance limits that are the maximum acceptable rates of unauthorized service changes. Makes carriers that exceed such limits liable for forfeiture penalties. Applies existing slamming liability provisions only to intrastate service changes.</summary>
