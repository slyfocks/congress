Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE) prevention, intervention, and services delivery program. Authorizes the Secretary to award grants, cooperative agreements, and technical assistance to eligible State, tribal, and local governments, scientific or academic institutions, and nonprofit organizations to carry out such activities. Directs the Secretary to establish a National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect to: (1) foster coordination among governmental agencies, academic bodies, and community groups that support FAS and FAE research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise meet the needs of populations actually or potentially impacted by FAS and FAE; and (2) advise Federal, State, and local programs and research concerning FAS and FAE. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2003. Terminates application of this Act seven years after the date on which all Task Force members have been appointed.</summary>
