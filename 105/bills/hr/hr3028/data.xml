Title II: FDA Jurisdiction Over Tobacco Products - Declares that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Food and Drug Administration, shall have the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to regulate the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, and advertising of tobacco products.
