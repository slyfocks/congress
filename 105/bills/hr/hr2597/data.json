Title II: Reduction in Arms Transfer Subsidies - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to repeal provisions with respect to: (1) leases of defense articles and loan authority for cooperative research and development purposes; and (2) the President's authority to waive specified charges for sales that would significantly advance North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) standardization, standardization with armed forces of specified other countries, or foreign procurement in the United States under coproduction arrangements. (Sec. 202) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to repeal the President's authority to transfer excess defense articles to certain other countries. (Sec. 203) Amends the Arms Export Control Act to state that any sale involving the export of major defense equipment pursuant to a license or other approval, except in certain circumstances, shall include an appropriate charge, comparable to a specified charge imposed for government-to-government sales, for a proportionate amount of the nonrecurring costs incurred by the United States in the research, development, and production of such equipment. (Sec. 204) Declares that no military financing program funds under the Arms Export Control Act may be made available for: (1) grants or loans to Greece, Turkey, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Caribbean countries, or any country eligible to participate in the Partnership for Peace Initiative in FY 1997; or (2) the Enhanced International Peacekeeping Initiative. (Sec. 205) Declares that no Economic Support Fund moneys under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 may be made available for Turkey, Haiti, or Cambodia to offset costs of purchasing defense articles or defense services from the United States. (Sec. 206) Declares that no Federal funds may be used to offset the cost of a demonstration or exhibition of defense articles or defense services at a trade show or other international arms bazaar or promotional event in a foreign country."
