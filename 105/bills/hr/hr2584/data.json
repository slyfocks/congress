Limits such penalties to ten years' imprisonment, unless the offense caused serious physical injury to, or endangered the life of, a patient (up to 20 years' imprisonment) or caused the death of a patient (up to life imprisonment). Specifies that the sentencing court shall order a person convicted of an offense under this title to pay restitution to the patient and any payor for losses sustained as a result of the offense. Provides for criminal forfeiture of the proceeds of health care fraud. Authorizes appropriations for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Attorneys, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to hire, equip, and train personnel in connection with the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud cases. Title II: Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission - Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission Act of 1997 - Establishes the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Commission to investigate the nature, magnitude, and cost of health care fraud and abuse and develop methods for its prevention, detection, and prosecution or litigation. Authorizes appropriations."
