Amends Federal law relating to the Agua Caliente (Palm Springs) Reservation in California to repeal the restriction on the distribution of net rents, profits, and other revenues from the Mineral Springs parcel to certain members of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Makes such repeal applicable as if enacted on March 31, 1983. Provides for any per capita distribution of tribal revenues to be made to all members of the Band in equal amounts."
