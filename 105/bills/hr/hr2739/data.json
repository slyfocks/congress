Sets forth provisions regarding functions, composition and terms, termination, compensation, personnel, and administrative services. Revises Federal judicial code provisions regarding judicial discipline to authorize any person alleging that a circuit, district, bankruptcy, or magistrate judge or a judge of the Court of Federal Claims or of the Court of International Trade has engaged in conduct prejudicial to the effective and efficient administration of the business of the courts, or alleging that such judge is unable to discharge all the duties of the office by reason of mental or physical disability, to file with the Board a written complaint containing a brief statement of the facts constituting such conduct. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) investigations, the conduct of proceedings (including confidentiality of information or evidence acquired), and the filing of formal charges against a judge by the Board; (2) Court hearings, decisions and sanctions, and certifications of grounds for impeachment; (3) appeals of Court decision; and (4) reimbursement for reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by a judge following dismissal of a complaint."
