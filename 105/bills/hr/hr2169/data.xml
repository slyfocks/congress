  <summary>11/1/1997--Line item veto by President.
(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On November 1, 1997, the President exercised the line-item veto to cancel the dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority in connection with the following projects contained in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998: (1) improvements by the Federal Railroad Administration to the Seward dock, Seward, Alaska; (2) an Electronic Distribution Center for Surplus Transit-Related Equipment (Federal Transit Administration); and (3) a transportation emergency preparedness and response demonstration project, including an underground emergency transportation management center using satellite communications, Arab, Alabama (Research and Special Programs Administration). (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2169, H.Rept. 105-313, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-72 through 97-74.))
