    "text": "(On June 25, 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the Line Item Veto Act (Public Law 104-130) is unconstitutional, thus restoring provisions that had been cancelled as summarized below.) (On November 1, 1997, the President exercised the line-item veto to cancel the dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority in connection with the following projects contained in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998: (1) improvements by the Federal Railroad Administration to the Seward dock, Seward, Alaska; (2) an Electronic Distribution Center for Surplus Transit-Related Equipment (Federal Transit Administration); and (3) a transportation emergency preparedness and response demonstration project, including an underground emergency transportation management center using satellite communications, Arab, Alabama (Research and Special Programs Administration). (Note: The high degree of specificity of the items cancelled precluded their inclusion in the original law's summary. As a result, the original law's summary and the summary of the law after the item vetoes are identical. For more information on the specific items vetoed, see the text of the conference report for H.R. 2169, H.Rept. 105-313, and Presidential Cancellation Numbers 97-72 through 97-74.))

Title III: General Provisions - Sets forth specified prohibitions, limitations, permissions, and mandates with respect to the use of appropriations under this Act identical or very similar to those enacted in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-205).

(Sec. 331) Prohibits expenditure of funds made available under this Act by any entity that does not agree to comply with the Buy American Act.

(Sec. 335) Directs the FAA to provide personnel at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, to provide real-time weather and runway observation and other functions to help ensure aviation safety. (Sec. 336) Prohibits the provision of essential air service to communities in the 48 contiguous States that are fewer than 70 miles from the nearest large and medium hub airport, or that require a rate of subsidy per passenger in excess of $200 unless such point is greater than 210 miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport. (Sec. 337) Amends the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 with respect to exceptions to the prohibition on common carrier permits for air passenger transportation (for compensation or hire) between Love Field, Texas, and one or more points outside Texas. Declares that the exception for commuter aircraft with a passenger capacity of 56 passengers or less includes any aircraft (not exceeding gross aircraft weight of 300,000 pounds) reconfigured to accommodate 56 or fewer passengers. Exempts from the prohibition air transportation of individuals from Love Field to one or more points within the States of Kansas, Alabama, and Mississippi (currently, just Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas), subject to specified conditions. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to monitor the safety of flight operations in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and take necessary action to ensure safe aviation operations. Requires the Administrator to notify specified congressional committees if aviation operations in the area are restricted due to unsafe airspace management conditions. (Sec. 339) Directs the Department of the Navy to transfer the inactive USNS EDENTON (ATS-1) to the U.S. Coast Guard. (Sec. 340) Declares that monies paid by diversion from airport revenues for claims related to ceded lands owned by native Americans, native Hawaiians, or Alaskan natives shall not be subject to repayment. Prohibits further payment of such claims from airport revenues. (Sec. 341) Prohibits the use of funds under this Act by the Coast Guard to issue or enforce certain regulations under the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act, unless such regulations recognize and provide, with respect to (animal) fats, (vegetable) oils, and greases, for differences in physical, chemical, biological, and other relevant properties, and in environmental effects. (Sec. 342) Authorizes the Secretary to allow issuers to redeem preferred stock sold to the Department of Transportation. (Sec. 343) Extends from September 30, 1997, to February 28, 1998, the authority for the operation of longer combination vehicles in Nebraska. (Sec. 344) Requires the FAA to furnish employment records of air pilots to non-scheduled air carriers within 30 days of a request before it can require such carriers to check such records before hiring an individual as a pilot. (Sec. 345) Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Secretary to grant or deny, within 120 days after receiving it, any application for an exemption (to improve air service between a nonhub airport and a high density airport) from certain requirements pertaining to the use of slots (arrival and departure spaces) at such high density airports. (Sec. 346) Authorizes the Secretary to take receipt of such equipment and sites of the Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) as may be necessary for the establishment of the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS). Authorizes the Secretary to establish the NDGPS.
