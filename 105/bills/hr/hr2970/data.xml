Directs the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services to establish a process for identifying and selecting an eligible entity to which a station could be conveyed for education, park, recreation, cultural, and historic preservation purposes. Requires: (1) the Secretary to review all applicants for the conveyance of a station identified as excess to an agency's needs and forward to the Administrator a single approved application for such station; and (2) the Administrator to convey such station, subject to specified conditions that include a requirement that active aids to navigation continue to be operated and maintained by the United States if considered necessary by the Administrator. Requires: (1) a station to be offered for sale in accordance with terms developed by the Administrator if no applicants are approved for conveyance; and (2) net sale proceeds to be transferred to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program. Requires any Federal department or agency to which a station is conveyed to maintain the station in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Secretary's Historic Preservation Standards.</summary>
