  <summary>2/12/1997--Introduced.
Freedom From Government Competition Act of 1997 - Requires Federal agencies to obtain all goods and services necessary for or beneficial to the accomplishment of their authorized functions by procurement from private sources, unless except as specified. (Sec. 4) Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a Center for Commercial Activities and Privatization within OMB to: (1) be responsible for the implementation of and compliance with the policies, standards, and procedures that are set forth in this Act or are prescribed to carry out this Act; and (2) provide agencies and private sector entities with guidance, information, and other assistance appropriate for facilitating conversions to use of private sector entities for providing goods and services on behalf of the Federal Government. (Sec. 5) Amends Federal law to require that each agency shall include in its annual performance plan the identity of each program activity that is: (1) performed for the agency by a private sector entity in accordance with this Act; and (2) not subject to this Act by reason of an exception, together with a discussion specifying why the activity is determined to be covered by the exception. Revises requirements regarding program performance reports to require each agency, in its annual program performance report, in the case of an activity not performed by a private sector entity, to: (1) explain and describe whether an activity not performed by a private sector entity could be performed by a private sector entity in accordance with this Act; and (2) if the activity could be performed by a private sector entity, set forth a schedule for converting to performance of the activity by a private sector entity.</summary>
