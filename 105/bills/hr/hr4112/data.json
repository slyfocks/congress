Title I: Congressional Operations - Congressional Operations Appropriations Act, 1999 - Makes appropriations for the Senate for: (1) expense allowances; (2) representation allowances for the Majority and Minority Leaders; (3) salaries of specified officers, employees, and committees (including the Committee on Appropriations); (4) agency contributions for employee benefits; (5) inquiries and investigations; (6) the U.S. Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control; (7) the Offices of the Secretary, Sergeant at Arms, and Doorkeeper of the Senate; (8) miscellaneous items; (9) the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account; and (10) official mail costs.

Requires amounts specifically allocated for official mail expenses to be recalculated in accordance with regulations of the Committee on Rules and Administration in lieu of such amounts being included in the recalculation formula used for amounts authorized for a Senator's expense in the event that the term of office of a Senator begins after the first month of a fiscal year or ends (except by reason of death, resignation, or expulsion) before the last month of a fiscal year. (Sec. 2) Increases, from $10,000 to $35,000, the annual limitation on the disbursements from the Office of the Chaplain Expense Revolving Fund. (Sec. 3) Amends Senate Resolution 149, 103d Congress, to extend the Senate Arms Control Observer Group through December 31, 2000. (Sec. 4) Amends the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1977 to authorize the President pro tempore of the Senate to appoint and fix the compensation of one consultant, on a temporary or intermittent basis, at the daily rate of compensation not in excess of that specified in Federal provisions relating to appointment of consultants by the Majority and Minority Leaders, the Secretary of Senate, and the Legislative Counsel of the Senate. Provides that provisions under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System relating to annuities and pay on reemployment are inapplicable to any individual serving in a position under such Federal provisions. Permits any or all appointments under such provisions to be at an annual rate of compensation rather than at a daily rate, under specified conditions. (Sec. 5) Establishes the Senate Leader's Lecture Series. Provides that: (1) expenses incurred in connection with such Series shall be paid from the appropriations account \"Secretary of the Senate\" within the contingent fund of the Senate and shall not exceed $30,000 in any fiscal year; and (2) such payments may cover expenses incurred by speakers, including travel, subsistence, and per diem, and the cost of receptions, including food, food related items, and hospitality. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate to appoint and fix the compensation of employees necessary to operate Senate Hair Care Services (Services). Establishes the Senate Hair Care Services Revolving Fund in the Treasury within the contingent fund of the Senate to be made available, without fiscal year limitation, for disbursement by the Secretary of the Senate for: (1) payment of salaries and agency contributions of employees of the Services; and (2) necessary supplies, equipment, and other Services' expenses. Requires the Secretary, at the direction of the Committee on Rules and Administration, to withdraw from the Fund and deposit in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, all moneys in the Fund that the Committee may determine are in excess of the current and reasonably foreseeable needs of the Services. Transfers to the Fund any unobligated balance in the Senate Employees Barber Shop Revolving Fund. Repeals Federal provisions: (1) establishing the Senate Employees Barber Shop Revolving Fund; and (2) authorizing the Sergeant at Arms and the Doorkeeper of the Senate to employ and fix the compensation of employees that operate the Senate Beauty Shop. (Sec. 7) Increases the amount made available to the Committee on Rules and Administration for expenses of consultants, under S. Res. 54, 105th Congress. (Sec. 8) Provides for increases in the aggregate compensation paid to employees in Senate offices.

Allows such: (1) agreements to provide for necessary fueling infrastructure in connection with the vehicles; and (2) vehicles to be made available for a maximum 90-day period. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Committee on Appropriations in its discretion to: (1) hold hearings, report such hearings, and make investigations as authorized by rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate; (2) make expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate; (3) employ personnel; (4) with the prior consent of the Government department or agency concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration use, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, the services of personnel of any such department or agency; (5) procure the services of individual consultants, or organizations thereof; and (6) provide training of the professional staff of such Committee. Amends S. Res. 54 (Omnibus Committee Funding Resolution for 1997 and 1998) to delete provisions authorizing expenditures by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. (Sec. 11) Authorizes the Chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations to transfer funds from the appropriation account for: (1) salaries for the Committee to the account, within the contingent fund of the Senate, from which expenses are payable; and (2) expenses, within the contingent fund of the Senate for the Committee, to the account from which salaries are payable for such Committee. (Sec. 12) Amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to exempt travel awards relating to air transportation for a Member of the Senate, the Member's spouse, son, or daughter between the Washington metropolitan area and the Member's State from provisions which consider any travel award that accrues by reason of official travel of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to be the property of the office for which the travel was performed and prohibits the conversion of such award to personal use. (Sec. 13) Amends S. Res. 286, 102d Congress, to make fees established under such resolution for services received from the Attending Physician by a Senator or an officer of the Senate equal to the fees for such services received by a Member of the House of Representatives. Makes appropriations for the House of Representatives for: (1) a specified widow of a deceased Member of Congress; (2) House leadership offices; (3) Members' representational allowances; (4) committee employees; (5) officers and employees; (6) specified allowances and expenses; and (7) the House Child Care Center.

Removes provisions permitting the use of the Members' Representational Allowance for a Representative's payment of nonpostage fees and charges for the above services and for postage for mail for official business sent outside the United States. (Sec. 105) Requires any information on payments made by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to an individual for attendance as a witness before the Committee in executive session during a Congress to be reported by the second semiannual report filed under specified provisions of the House of Representatives Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act in the following Congress. (Sec. 106) Permits the Committee on House Oversight to prescribe by regulation appropriate conditions for the incidental use, for other than official business, of equipment and supplies owned or leased by, or the cost of which is reimbursed by, the House. (Sec. 107) Authorizes the Speaker and the Majority and Minority Leaders to each appoint and fix the compensation of one consultant, on a temporary or intermittent basis, at a daily rate of compensation not in excess of the per diem equivalent of the highest gross rate of annual compensation which may be paid to employees of a House standing committee.
