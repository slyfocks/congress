(Sec. 104) Subjects FSHCs and certain foreign bank operations to the same restrictions on affiliate transactions that are imposed upon Federal Reserve member banks. Authorizes the appropriate Federal regulatory agency (the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Reserve Board, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), or the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) to adopt rules and regulations to prevent an insured depository institution that is controlled by an FSHC from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices. Authorizes the appropriate Federal banking agency, with the concurrence of the national Financial Services Committee, to exempt any FSHC-controlled depository institution from any Federal Reserve Act requirement. Requires an FSHC-controlled depository institution (except certain foreign-controlled banks) to obtain the authorization of the National Financial Services Committee before entering into certain credit, indemnity, guarantee, or insurance activities on behalf of any affiliate that is neither a financial services institution nor primarily engaged in financial activities. (Sec. 105) Requires that each insured depository institution that is controlled by an FSHC be well capitalized. Requires any FSHC controlling a undercapitalized insured depository institution to: (1) enter into an agreement with the appropriate Federal regulatory agency to return the institution to being well capitalized; or (2) divest control of such bank or institution. Prohibits the appropriate Federal banking agency from imposing any requirements pertaining to the capitalization of an FSHC. (Sec. 106) Subjects interstate acquisitions of an insured bank by an FSHC to the same restrictions as are applicable to bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. (Sec. 107) Prohibits Federal and State regulatory agencies from enacting laws that discriminate against FSHCs or their affiliates. Preempts any Federal or State provision inconsistent with the purposes of this Act (including any provision impeding any insurance company or its affiliate from becoming an FSHC, or from acquiring control of a depository institution). (Sec. 108) Subjects FSHCs to the insider lending prohibitions of the Federal Reserve Act. (Sec. 109) Sets forth reporting, examination and enforcement guidelines, including guidelines for divestiture and criminal penalties in the event the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that a depository institution has engaged in a continuing course of conduct involving its FSHC which may affect the safety and soundness of such institution. (Sec. 110) Provides for administrative (including divestiture), criminal, and civil penalties for specified violations of this Act, as well as judicial review of adverse administrative orders. Prohibits such agency from requiring any FSHC to serve as a "source of strength" to any of its depository institution affiliates. (Sec. 114) Establishes a National Financial Services Committee to: (1) establish uniform principles and standards for the examination and supervision of financial services institutions and FSHCs; and (2) recommend to the Congress uniformity in other supervisory matters, as well as additional measures to strengthen the separation of insured banks and institutions controlled by FSHCs from the activities of their affiliates. Prescribes notice procedure guidelines for determining new financial services institutions and new financial activities.

(Sec. 122) Prohibits a depository institution with a securities affiliate, except in certain circumstances, from extending credit to the affiliate (or purchasing its financial assets), to enhance the marketability of securities underwritten by the securities affiliate. Prohibits an FSHC, with certain exceptions, from extending or arranging for the extension of credit secured by or for the purpose of purchasing a security (or making payments on principal) that is the subject of a distribution in which an affiliate of the FSHC participates as underwriter or member of a selling group. Prohibits an FSHC with a securities affiliate, with certain exceptions, from extending credit to an issuer of securities underwritten by such securities affiliate for the purpose of making payments on those securities. Requires the appropriate Federal banking agency to prescribe circumstances under which directors and senior executive officers of a securities affiliate may serve simultaneously as directors or senior executive officers of an affiliated depository institution. Exempts small FSHCs (total assets under $500 million) and certain foreign affiliates from such regulations. Prescribes public disclosure requirements for securities affiliates and insured depository institutions. Prohibits a securities affiliate from underwriting securities secured by or representing an interest in mortgages or other obligations originated or purchased by an affiliated depository institution, unless one of four specified requirements is met. Proscribes certain reciprocal arrangements between FSHCs. Allocates Federal oversight responsibilities among the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the appropriate Federal banking agencies. Prescribes circumstances in which a branch, agency, or commercial lending company that is operated by a foreign bank that is a financial services holding company is not subject to specified limitations placed upon securities activities of depository institutions with securities affiliates. Exempts a wholesale financial institution and transactions between it and its securities affiliates, from the requirements of this section, except those providing for additional safeguards and certain compliance programs. Applies this same exemption to a national market lending institution controlled by an FSHC. States that Federal prescriptions governing the FSHCs are subject to the approval of the National Financial Services Committee (NFSC). (Sec. 123) States that the NFSC shall prescribe standards applicable to any FSHC affiliated-depository institution that is not an SEC-registered broker, but effects retail securities transactions.
