  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997 - Authorizes an association of employers of private security officers (officers) to submit fingerprints or other methods of positive identification to the Attorney General for background checks of such officers. Allows the Attorney General to: (1) exchange identification and criminal history records with State governmental agencies for licensing and employment purposes; and (2) prescribe regulations to carry out this Act, including measures relating to the imposition of fees necessary for the recovery of costs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that States should participate in the background check system established under this Act.</summary>
