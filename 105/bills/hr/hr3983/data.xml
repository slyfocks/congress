  <summary>6/3/1998--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to require passport applications for children under age 16 to be signed by: (1) both parents if the child lives with both parents; (2) the parent having primary custody of the child if the child does not live with both parents; or (3) the surviving parent (or legal guardian) of the child if one or both parents are deceased. Permits waiver of such requirement if the Secretary of State determines that circumstances do not permit obtaining the signatures of both parents.</summary>
