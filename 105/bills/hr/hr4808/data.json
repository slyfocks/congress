(Current law prohibits affiliations between depository institutions and GSEs.) Limits the value of the investment portfolio of SALLIE MAE in its GSE status in the event such affiliation should occur to the lesser of: (1) its value upon enactment of this Act; or (2) its value on the date such affiliation is consummated. Grants the Secretary enforcement powers under the Higher Education Act of 1965."
