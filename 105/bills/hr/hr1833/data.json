Sets forth program requirements and related provisions. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) conduct a study to determine the feasibility of a Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration Project for appropriate programs, services, functions, and activities of HHS, other than the Indian Health Service; (2) consult with Indian tribes to determine a study protocol for consultation prior to consultation with other specified entities; and (3) publish the proposed protocol and allow a comment period for interested individuals. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary, at the request of an Indian tribe, to enter into an agreement for the acquisition of any goods, services or supplies available to the Secretary from other Federal agencies that are not directly available to the tribe under this Act or any other Federal law, including acquisitions from prime vendors. Deems Indian patient records, at the option of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, to be Federal records for the limited purposes of making such records eligible for storage by Federal Records Centers to the same extent and in the same manner as other HHS patient records. Repeals current provisions of the Act that provide for a Tribal Self-Governance Project and makes funds for such Project available for use under this Act."
