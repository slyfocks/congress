  <summary>3/6/1997--Introduced.
Freedom of Speech and Association on Campus Act of 1997 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to provide that no students at higher education institutions shall, on the basis of their exercise of constitutionally-protected speech and association, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination or official sanction under any education program, activity, or division directly or indirectly receiving financial assistance under HEA, whether or not such program, activity, or division is sponsored or officially-sanctioned by the institution. Prohibits the availability of HEA funds to any such institution that the Secretary of Education finds has violated this Act. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to: (1) HEA funds for student assistance; and (2) higher education institutions controlled by religious or military organizations, if such speech or association is not consistent with the institutions' religious tenets or military training. Provides that such prohibition shall not be construed to prevent imposition of an official sanction on a student determined to have willfully participated in the disruption or attempted disruption of a lecture, class, speech, presentation, or performance made or scheduled to be made under the auspices of the institution of higher education.</summary>
