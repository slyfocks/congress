  <summary>4/1/1998--Introduced.
Clean Air Common Sense Act - Sets forth provisions regarding the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's authorities to establish a requirement that States submit measures in State implementation plans under the Clean Air Act to ensure that emission reductions are achieved to mitigate transport of ozone pollution and oxides of nitrogen emissions across States included in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region (relating to the eastern portion of the United States). Prohibits: (1) the promulgation of a final rule to establish such requirement before the expiration of the one-year period beginning on the date the Administrator publishes notice that data described in this Act is publicly available; and (2) such rule from becoming effective before the later of May 1, 2005, or the expiration of the five-year period beginning on the date the rule is promulgated. Directs the Administrator, during the one-year period beginning on this Act's enactment, to collect data that the States in such region develop through air quality monitoring and modeling with respect to oxides of nitrogen and other pollutants to be regulated for purposes of a specified 1997 proposed rulemaking. Makes data publicly available after the expiration of such period. Establishes additional time frames with respect to the Administrator's findings, and denial of petitions, regarding sources that emit oxides of nitrogen or other pollutants to be regulated under the proposed rulemaking in violation of interstate pollution abatement requirements.</summary>
