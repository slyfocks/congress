  <summary>2/25/1998--Introduced.
Provides that the occupation "information technology professional" (as defined by this Act) shall be treated for three years as if the Secretary of Labor had made a determination under the Immigration and Nationality Act that there were not sufficient domestic workers and that such aliens' entry would not adversely affect similarly employed U.S. workers. (Such determination is required for immigrant visas under skilled worker, professional, and other worker allocations.) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to limit such labor determination to three years.</summary>
