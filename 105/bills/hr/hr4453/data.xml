  <summary>8/6/1998--Introduced.
Protect American Jobs Through the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Amendments Act of 1998 - Amends the Sherman and Federal Trade Commission Acts with respect to their application to certain conduct (subject to antitrust prohibitions) and to methods of unfair competition involving commerce with foreign nations only where such conduct or methods have a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on export commerce with foreign nations of a person engaged in such commerce in the United States. Declares that such Acts shall apply only for injury to export business in the United States (as in current law), and without regard to the effect of specified conduct on U.S. consumers. Declares that a determination of whether the effect of such conduct is substantial may be made solely with reference to the product or type of product affected by the conduct and the geographical area in which such conduct occurs.</summary>
