Declares that such Acts shall apply only for injury to export business in the United States (as in current law), and without regard to the effect of specified conduct on U.S. consumers. Declares that a determination of whether the effect of such conduct is substantial may be made solely with reference to the product or type of product affected by the conduct and the geographical area in which such conduct occurs."
