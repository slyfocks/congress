  <summary>03/12/1997--Introduced.
Allows each Member of the House of Representatives to hire one additional employee under the Members' Representational Allowance if: (1) at the time of such employment, the individual employed is receiving welfare; and (2) by reason of the employment, the individual is no longer eligible for welfare. Provides that nothing in this Act may be construed to permit any increase in the amount of funds provided under the Members' Representational Allowance of any Member who hires such employee. Amends the Social Security Act to provide that, with respect to a Member who employs in the District of Columbia a recipient of assistance under a State grant program under such Act, as long as the State represented by the Member elects to treat the recipient as a member of a family in such State for purposes of its welfare participation rate requirements, the recipient shall be so treated by only that State.</summary>
