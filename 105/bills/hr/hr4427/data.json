    "text": "Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prescribe penalties to be imposed against any person who, while engaged in the business of betting or wagering, knowingly uses a communication facility for the transmission or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers, information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, or a communication that entitles the transmitter or receiver to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers. Provides a smaller penalty for those engaging in such activities who are not in the business of betting or wagering. Provides prohibition exceptions, including for information for use in news reporting. Sets forth provisions regarding duties of common carriers and interactive computer service providers upon being notified by a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency of violations. Provides for injunctive relief, subject to specified limitations."
