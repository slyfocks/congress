TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Political Freedom in China Title II: Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation Title I - Political Freedom in China Act of 1997 - Urges the Secretary of State to: (1) request the immediate and unconditional release of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners of conscience in Tibet, as well as in China; (2) seek access for international humanitarian organizations to Drapchi prison and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in China, to ensure that prisoners are not being mistreated and are receiving necessary medical treatment; and (3) call on China to begin serious discussions with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, on the future of Tibet. (Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 for: (1) additional diplomatic personnel at U.S. posts in China and Nepal to monitor political repression in China; and (2) the National Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, civil society, and the development of the rule of law in China. Directs the Secretary to use funds in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to provide grants to nongovernmental organizations to promote the aforementioned goals. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees on human rights in China, including religious persecution, the development of democratic institutions, and the rule of law. Directs the Secretary to establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China which shall provide information on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and prisoners of faith in China. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of the Congress that it, the President, and the Secretary should work with governments of other countries to establish a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. (Sec. 8) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Hong Kong people should continue to have the right to freely elect their legislative representatives, and that the first legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be determined by them through an election law convention, a referendum, or both. (Sec. 9) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the Government of China should stop the practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for profit from prisoners that it executes; (2) China should be strongly condemned for such practices; (3) the President should bar entry into the United States of any Chinese officials known to be involved in such practices; (4) individuals involved in the sale of such organs in the United States should be prosecuted; and (5) the appropriate U.S. officials should interview individuals, including doctors, who may have knowledge of such practices. Title II: Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation - Amends Federal law to extend the congressional review period for licensing nuclear exports to China from 30 to 120 days. Provides for congressional procedures for consideration of a joint resolution for disapproval for any licensing agreement.</summary>
