(Sec. 4) Prohibits any franchisor or subfranchisor, in connection with the performance, enforcement, renewal, and termination of any franchise agreement, from: (1) engaging in an act, practice, course of business, or pattern of conduct which operates as a fraud upon any person; (2) discriminating among franchisees on the basis of race, sex, religion, disability, or national origin; (3) hindering or prohibiting the free association of franchisees for any lawful purpose, including the formation of or participation in any trade association made up of franchisees; and (4) discriminating against a franchisee by imposing requirements not imposed on other similarly situated franchisees or otherwise retaliating against any franchisee for membership or participation in a franchisee association. Prohibits a franchisor from: (1) terminating a franchise agreement prior to its expiration without good cause; (2) prohibiting a franchisee from obtaining equipment, fixtures, supplies, or services used in the business licensed by the franchise agreement from sources of the franchisee's choosing, with exceptions; and (3) prohibiting, or enforcing a prohibition against, a franchisee from engaging in any business at any location after the expiration (or termination for good cause) of a franchise agreement. (Sec. 5) Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) minimum standards of conduct (good faith, due care, and limited fiduciary duty) for each party to a franchise agreement; (2) a prohibition against requiring the inclusion of a franchise agreement term or condition which violates this Act or relieves a person from a duty or liability under this Act; (3) a prohibition against the waiver from compliance with this Act; (4) legal actions brought by persons injured or damaged by violations; (5) the right to arbitration or mediation in lieu of a legal action; (6) authorized legal actions by State attorneys general on behalf of State residents for alleged violations; and (7) the obligation to comply with all applicable State franchising laws to the extent not inconsistent with this Act."
