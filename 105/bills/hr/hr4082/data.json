    "text": "Small Business Interest Checking Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to provide that any depository institution may permit: (1) the owner of any interest-bearing or dividend-earning account to make up to 24 transfers per month, for any purpose, to another account of the owner in the same institution; and (2) the owner of any deposit or account (negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, account) to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments for the purpose of making payments to third parties. Amends the Federal Reserve Act, the Home Owners' Loan Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to repeal the proscription against interest payments on demand deposits. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to: (1) mandate quarterly payment of interest on depository institution reserve requirement balances; and (2) authorize a reduction to zero percent of the mandatory ratios for such reserve requirements (which would thus eliminate such reserve requirements)."
