Provides for the powers of IGs.

Requires the Governor of each State to designate State agencies that conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits, civil and criminal investigations, inspections, and evaluations. Authorizes each Governor to establish and maintain a State agency to act as a Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Unit. Establishes: (1) the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account in the Treasury; and (2) the Account Payments Advisory Board to make recommendations to the IGs regarding the equitable allocation of payments from the Account."
