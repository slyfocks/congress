Amends the Federal judicial code to prohibit any district court from granting an injunction restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any State statute or Act of Congress upon the ground of unconstitutionality unless the injunction application is heard and determined by a three-judge court. Excepts such proceedings from provisions authorizing direct appeals to the Supreme Court from decisions of three-judge courts.</summary>
