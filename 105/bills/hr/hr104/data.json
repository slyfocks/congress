    "text": "National Park Enhancement and Revitalization Act - Amends the National Park Service Organic Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, after a positive determination of being in the public interest and publication of notice in the Federal Register, to dispose of lands or interests therein within the National Battlefields, National Historical Parks, and other units of the National Park System (NPS) and to accept other land, cash, or a combination of each as consideration for such disposals. Requires the Secretary to: (1) include in disposal terms such conditions or reservations to ensure preservation of the public interest and uses of such areas; and (2) allow landowners from whom such land was originally acquired by the United States an opportunity to reacquire such land or interest. Requires each disposal in excess of $150,000 to be reported to specified congressional committees. Authorizes the Secretary to lease NPS units under similar conditions as above. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire easements or other interests in lands for inclusion in the NPS under specified conditions. Directs the General Accounting Office to undertake a study of less-than-fee title acquisitions of interests in lands for the NPS to assess their effectiveness and efficiency for producing public benefits."
