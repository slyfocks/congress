  <summary>7/14/1998--Introduced.
India-Pakistan Sanctions Flexibility Act - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to exempt Department of Agriculture assistance for the purchase of food or other agricultural commodities, or Export-Import Bank of the United States or Overseas Private Investment Corporation assistance, from the prohibition against extensions of U.S. Government credit, credit guarantees, or other financial assistance to countries involved in the transfer or use of nuclear explosive devices. Declares that such assistance shall be available only to the extent that an official budget request that includes designation of such assistance as an emergency requirement as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman- Hollings Act) is transmitted by the President to the Congress. Authorizes the President to suspend until March 1, 1999, the application of any sanction or prohibition contained in specified Federal laws with respect to India and Pakistan.</summary>
