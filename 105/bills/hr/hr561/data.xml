Children Health Insurance Act of 1997 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, to: (1) require group health plans and health insurers to provide access to coverage for a participant's or beneficiary's qualifying children; and (2) impose a noncompliance excise tax. Provides a tax credit, subject to limitations based on adjusted gross income, for an individual who purchases child health care coverage. Provides, as specified, for the payment by an employer of an additional payment to an employee's children's health insurance credit advance amount. Sets forth a reporting requirement relating to premiums received for health insurance coverage for children. Prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee eligible for the credit. Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require a State plan to provide cost-sharing assistance for qualifying children in a family with income below 150 percent of the poverty line. Provides for grants to States to operate health insurance outreach and information programs concerning access to the benefits and coverage provided by this Act.</summary>
