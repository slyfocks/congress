  <summary>3/11/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal motor vehicle safety law to provide an exception to requirements prohibiting a motor vehicle manufacturer, dealer, or repair business from knowingly making inoperative any motor vehicle safety device. Authorizes such persons to install a device which may be used by a driver to deactivate an air bag in a car, truck, bus, or multipurpose passenger vehicle, as long as the device causes the air bag to activate when the vehicle engine is turned off.</summary>
