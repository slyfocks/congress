    "text": "On-Line Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act - Amends Federal copyright law to exempt an on-line material provider from liability for direct infringement, based solely on the intermediate storage and transmission of material over such provider's network, if: (1) the transmission was initiated by another person; (2) the storage and transmission is carried out through an automatic technological process, without any selection of that material by the provider; and (3) any copy of such material is not retained longer than necessary to carry out that transmission. Exempts such a provider from liability for monetary relief for contributory infringement or vicarious liability based solely on the above conduct or on the transmission or provision of access to such material over the provider's system or network if the provider: (1) does not know of information indicating that the material is infringing; and (2) does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity. Exempts a provider from any claim based on such provider's removing or disabling on-line access to material in response to knowledge or information that such material is infringing, whether or not such material is in fact an infringement. Makes liable for damages any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that on-line material is an infringement."
