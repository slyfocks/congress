    "text": "Amends Federal aviation law (Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996) regarding employment investigations and restrictions to permit an air carrier to allow an individual to begin service as a small aircraft pilot, or a helicopter pilot on a non-scheduled operation, before such carrier receives certain requested background information. Sets a 90-day deadline within which the air carrier shall obtain and evaluate such information. Mandates that the pertinent contract stipulate that continuation of such individual's employment is predicated upon a satisfactory evaluation. Provides for waiver of this Act for a documented good faith attempt to obtain such information if the information source (air carrier or other person) no longer exists. Permits, upon request, a pilot who has been employed by an air carrier to review his or her employment records. Requires air carriers to make such records available within a reasonable time (but not later than 30 days after such request)."
