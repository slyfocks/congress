    "text": "Critical Infrastructure Radio Systems Protection Act of 1998 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to adopt rules to ensure the ongoing protection and promotion of radio spectrum used by electric, gas, and water utilities and natural gas and petroleum pipelines against interference from other users of spectrum and consistent with provisions of the Communications Act of 1934. Requires the FCC, until such rules are adopted, to discontinue licensing private mobile radio facilities on: (1) any channels that were formerly allocated by the FCC to the Power (IW) Radio Service or Petroleum (IP) Radio Service on either an exclusive or shared basis; and (2) any channels less than 15khz removed from such channels. Provides exceptions in the case of a license applicant that: (1) obtains the concurrence of the designated frequency advisory committee for the IW or IP Service, or both; or (2) obtains and submits written concurrence of all IW and IP radio services licensees having a co- channel or adjacent-channel facility within 70 miles of the applicant's proposed site."
