Title II: Authorization of Appropriations for Increased Funding for Radio Free Asia and Voice of America - Authorizes appropriations for International Broadcasting Activities for FY 1998 and 1999 in addition to sums previously authorized. Details allocation of such additional appropriations for Radio Free Asia. Instructs the Director of the United States Information Agency and the Board of Broadcasting Governors to seek to ensure that funds made available for broadcasting to nations whose people do not fully enjoy freedom of expression do not decline in proportion to amounts made available for broadcasting to other nations. (Sec. 202) Directs the President to report to the Congress on a plan to achieve continuous broadcasting of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America in multiple major dialects and languages to the People's Republic of China. (Sec. 203) Reduces authorization of appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 for Migration and Refugee Assistance. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 to support personnel in the United States Embassy in Beijing as well as in selected American consulates to monitor political repression in the People's Republic of China. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President should make freedom of religion one of the major objectives of U.S. foreign policy with respect to China; (2) the Department of State should raise the issue of individuals imprisoned or otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious grounds and request a complete and timely response from the Chinese Government regarding the individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against them, and the sentence imposed; and (3) the goal of official communications should be the expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and the end of religious harassment and repression."
