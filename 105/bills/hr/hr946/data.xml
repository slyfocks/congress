  <summary>03/05/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal employees' retirement law to compute annuities for Members of Congress under the same formula as applies to Federal employees generally. Subjects Members to the same guidelines as apply to Federal employees with respect to deductions from pay and Government contributions for retirement plans. Applies this Act to individuals who first served as Members of Congress in the 103d Congress or later. Requires Member annuities based on service performed before enactment of this Act or to which this Act does not apply to be computed as if this Act had never been enacted.</summary>
