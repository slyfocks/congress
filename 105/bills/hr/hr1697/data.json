Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate, and report to the Congress on, whether pollution and health hazards in the United States have worsened since January 1, 1994, to the extent that may be attributable to NAFTA, and specifically in and around the U.S.-Mexico and the U.S.-Canada borders. Directs the President to certify annually to the Congress whether or not each NAFTA country is meeting certain commitments made with respect to: (1) environmental protection in the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation; and (2) worker's rights in the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation."
