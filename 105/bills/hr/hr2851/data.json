States that this requirement shall not apply in the case of substitution of a generic drug for another. Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on: (1) the types of coverage decisions being made by carriers under Medicare part B as well as their legal authority to make them; and (2) whether further Federal guidance is needed to prevent regional disparities in coverage under Medicare part B."
