Sets forth authorized uses of, and limitations on, such funds. Establishes a Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System Fund for the payment of expenses related to the scheduling and transportation of U.S. prisoners and illegal and criminal aliens in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Makes appropriations for initial capitalization of the Fund. (Sec. 102) Prohibits the use of funds appropriated by this title to: (1) pay for abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or in the case of rape; or (2) require any person to perform or facilitate an abortion. (Sec. 110) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove the authority for beneficiaries of certain petitions for classification or applications for labor certifications to apply to the Attorney General for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Repeals provisions which allow certain employment-based immigrants to adjust to permanent residence status. Establishes the Immigration Detention and Naturalization Activity Account in the Treasury. Provides for: (1) the deposit of certain application fees into the Account; and (2) refunds to any appropriation for expenses incurred by the Attorney General for the detention of aliens, construction relating to such detention, and activities relating to naturalization.

Revises provisions requiring aliens to present border identification cards that match appropriate biometric characteristics in order to cross the border to phase in such requirement over a number of years, requiring all cards in circulation as of April 1, 1998, to match by October 1, 2003. (Current law applies such requirement to all cards presented three years after such Act's enactment date.)
