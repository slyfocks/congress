  <summary>4/23/1997--Introduced.
Child Abuse and Neglect Enforcement Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (Safe Streets Act) to provide for a ten percent reduction of drug control and system improvement (Byrne) grants to States that do not have in effect throughout the State a law requiring that a designated law enforcement agency make available to child protective and child welfare workers timely criminal conviction information and protection orders based on a claim of domestic or child abuse to the same extent as such information is made available to law enforcement officers in such State. Sets forth provisions regarding redistribution of funds. Directs the Attorney General to issue regulations to ensure compliance. (Sec. 3) Amends title XIX of the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for FY 1999 and subsequent fiscal years, to make a grant to a State for prevention and treatment of substance abuse only if such State requires by law or regulation that: (1) each newborn infant born in the State be tested for physical dependence on any drug, fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, the presence of alcohol, and the presence of drugs that are associated with substance abuse; and (2) if the newborn tests positive under any such test, the principal State or local agency with responsibility for the protection of children be notified. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) delayed applicability for certain States; and (2) reduction of a State's allotment for noncompliance. (Sec. 4) Amends: (1) the Safe Streets Act to authorize the use of Byrne grants to enforce child abuse and neglect laws and programs; and (2) the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to increase the set aside for child abuse victims. (Sec. 6) Directs the Comptroller General of the United States to study and report to the Congress and the Secretary on reporting requirements under Federal laws relating to child abuse and neglect and under provisions of the Social Security Act relating to foster care and adoption assistance. Requires the Secretary to conduct an analysis of such report, including any appropriate recommendations for reducing the number of reporting requirements, and submit such analysis to the Congress within 90 days. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) child advocacy centers play a vital role in interviewing, treating, and assisting victims of child abuse; (2) such centers are often responsible for intervening in a number of potentially dangerous domestic violence situations and thus preventing such violence or other incidents; and (3) it is appropriate to increase funding for such centers under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990.</summary>
