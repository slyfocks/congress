Adjusts the boundary of the Six Rivers National Forest to exclude such transferred land. Directs the Secretary to survey and monument the portion of the boundary of the Reservation established by the addition of lands under this Act. Extinguishes claims by the Tribe: (1) on land now administered as part of the Six Rivers National Forest based on the allegation of error in establishing the boundaries of the Hoopa Valley Reservation as configured before enactment of this Act; and (2) of failure to pay just compensation for a taking under the fifth amendment to the Constitution, if such claims are based on activities that occurred on the lands transferred to trust status under this Act."
