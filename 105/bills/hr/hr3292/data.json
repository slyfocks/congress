Provides for an \"increased dependent care credit equivalent amount\" (as defined) if the taxpayer has a child under the age of four, but only if the taxpayer elects not to use the credit for dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. (Sec. 3) Allows for an employer-provided child care credit of up to 25 percent of qualified child care expenditures (not to exceed $150,000), which can include the costs of acquiring or expanding property to be used as a qualified day care facility. (Sec. 4) Amends part A ( Block Grants to States for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) of title IV of the Social Security Act to provide for grants to States: (1) to improve the quality and safety of child care; (2) for the provision of child care assistance for low-income working families; and (3) for the provision of child care services before and after regular school hours. (Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations through FY 2003 for part I (21st Century Community Learning Centers Act) of title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Sets forth provisions concerning the distribution of assistance under part I. (Sec. 6) Revises IRC provisions concerning the aggregate amount of nonrefundable personal credits allowed to provide that the aggregate amount of such credits allowed shall not exceed the sum of: (1) the taxpayer's regular tax liability; plus (2) the alternative minimum tax."
