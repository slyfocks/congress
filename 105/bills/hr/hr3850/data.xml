  <summary>5/13/1998--Introduced.
Executive Privilege Notification Act of 1998 - Requires the President, whenever he or she asserts executive privilege in any forum, to promptly report the assertion to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the House Minority Leader, and the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders. Specifies the contents of such report, including any written legal opinion by the Attorney General regarding the lawfulness of the assertion. Makes: (1) it the duty of the presiding judicial officer to promptly report to the above individuals whenever, in a judicial action or proceeding, the President asserts executive privilege; and (2) this obligation independent of the reporting obligation of the President. Grants any Member of either House of the Congress the right to file an amicus brief, regarding any assertion of executive privilege by the President, in any judicial action or proceeding. Prohibits a person, in connection with any Federal criminal investigation, from asserting a testimonial privilege alleged to arise out of the function of protecting the President.</summary>
