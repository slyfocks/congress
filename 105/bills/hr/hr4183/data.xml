  <summary>6/25/1998--Introduced.
State Electric and Consumer Empowerment Act of 1998 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to declare that each State regulatory authority may: (1) ensure that rates charged by qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogenerators are just and reasonable and do not exceed the incremental cost at the time of delivery to the purchasing utility of alternative electric energy and capacity; (2) establish programs for monitoring the performance of in-State cogeneration and small power production facilities to determine whether they meet Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) standards for qualifying facilities; and (3) require that any pre-existing contracts be amended to conform to the requirements of this Act. Declares that nothing in such Act or any other law shall prohibit a State or FERC from ensuring that all costs associated with electric energy purchases from qualifying cogenerators or small power producers are recovered by the purchaser.</summary>
