  <summary>2/12/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize a levy on wages or property for failure to pay taxes only if the levy is approved by the appropriate internal revenue district's levy review panel. Exempts a levy from such review if there is a finding that the collection of the tax is in jeopardy. Directs a levy review panel to approve a levy unless a majority of panel members determine that: (1) other means of collecting the unpaid taxes are more appropriate; or (2) the Internal Revenue Service has not complied with applicable levy requirements. Provides for the appointment, for each internal revenue district, of an unpaid three-person levy review panel consisting of at least one attorney with an expertise in Federal taxation and one certified public accountant.</summary>
