Exempts a levy from such review if there is a finding that the collection of the tax is in jeopardy. Directs a levy review panel to approve a levy unless a majority of panel members determine that: (1) other means of collecting the unpaid taxes are more appropriate; or (2) the Internal Revenue Service has not complied with applicable levy requirements. Provides for the appointment, for each internal revenue district, of an unpaid three-person levy review panel consisting of at least one attorney with an expertise in Federal taxation and one certified public accountant."
