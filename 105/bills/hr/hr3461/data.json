Title II: Miscellaneous Fisheries Provisions - Amends the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Convention Act of 1995 to reauthorize the Act, add an annual congressional reporting requirement on the activities of the Fisheries Commission, the General Council, and the Scientific Council, and provide for allocating quotas under the Convention, among other changes. (Sec. 202) Reauthorizes the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 through 2001. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the States of Washington, Oregon, and California (involved States) to adopt and enforce State laws and regulations governing fishing and processing in the adjacent exclusive economic zone in any Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) fishery for which there is no fishery management plan in effect under that Act. Sets forth requirements for State management of a Dungeness crab fishery. Prohibits enforcement of any State limited access system for such a fishery (except with regard to landings) against a vessel not registered under the State law but otherwise legally fishing in the adjacent exclusive economic zone. Permits vessels to harvest or process Dungeness crab in the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the involved State only as authorized by a permit issued by any of those States or pursuant to any tribal treaty rights to Dungeness crab pursuant to United States v. Washington. Preserves the authority of any State under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (except as expressly provided under this Act) to regulate fishing, fish processing, or landing of fish, except as expressly provided in this title. Terminates the authority of the involved States under this title with respect to a Dungeness crab fishery when a fishery management plan for the fishery under the Magnuson-Stevens Act becomes effective. Title III: NOAA Hydrographic Services - Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 - Sets forth the responsibilities and authorities of the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including those regarding: (1) acquiring and disseminating hydrographic data; (2) promulgating hydrographic services standards; (3) ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage of hydrographic services; (4) maintaining a national hydrographic database; (5) providing hydrographic services in uniform, easily accessible formats; and (6) contracting for the acquisition of hydrographic data. (Sec. 304) Authorizes a quality assurance program, allowing certification of hydrographic products and use of a related emblem for certified products. Allows a fee for the certification and use. Establishes in the Treasury the Hydrographic Services Account, consisting of those fees, to be used for hydrographic services. Prohibits the Administrator from: (1) establishing any fee or other charge for the provision of any hydrographic service except as authorized by this title; and (2) increasing the amount of any fee or other charge for the provision of any hydrographic service except as authorized. (Sec. 305) Requires the Administrator and the Commandant of the Coast Guard to report to the Congress on implementation of real-time tide and current data systems in U.S. ports. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on a plan to ensure that Federal competence and expertise in hydrographic surveying will be maintained after the decommissioning of the three existing Administration hydrographic survey vessels. (Sec. 306) Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator for FY 1999 through 2001 for: (1) nautical mapping and charting; (2) hydrographic surveys; (3) geodetic functions; and (4) tide and current measurement functions. (Sec. 307) Amends the Coast and Geodetic Survey Commissioned Officers' Act of 1948 to: (1) set authorized levels of commissioned officers on NOAA's active list for FY 1999 through 2003, but allowing the Administrator to make certain reductions if appropriate; and (2) require a position to be appointed from the officers on such list serving in or above the grade of captain who shall be responsible for administration of the commissioned officers, and for oversight of the operation of NOAA's vessel fleet. Directs the Secretary of Commerce to terminate immediately the moratorium on new appointments of commissioned officers to the NOAA Corps. Title IV: Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative - Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act - Establishes the Northwest Straits Advisory Commission. (Sec. 404) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to provide assistance for use in accordance with the Northwest Straits Citizen's Advisory Commission Report of August 20, 1998, and the priorities of the Commission, to: (1) collect marine resources data in the Northwest Straits (NS); (2) coordinate Federal, State, and local marine resources NS protection and restoration activities; and (3) carry out other activities identified in the Report as important to such protection and restoration."
