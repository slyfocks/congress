New Jersey Women's Environmental Health Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to award one or more grants to the University of the Health Sciences of New Jersey to enable the University and its affiliates to conduct research, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, concerning environmental, lifestyle, and genetic susceptibilities for breast cancer in New Jersey. Directs the University to use amounts received under the grant to conduct a study to assess biological markers, exposure to carcinogens, and other potential risk factors contributing to the incidence of breast cancer in New Jersey. Requires the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services to be the co-investigator with the University for any population based epidemiologic studies that attempt to explore associations between environmental and other risk factors and breast cancer. Mandates an annual report. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
