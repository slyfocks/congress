  <summary>3/5/1998--Introduced.
Food Stamp Benefits for Aliens Restoration Act of 1998 - Amends the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to eliminate specified eligibility restrictions for qualified aliens (as defined in such Acts) with respect to: (1) food stamps; and (2) Federal means- tested public benefits. (Sec. 4) Prohibits States from attributing sponsor or spousal income and resources in determining an alien's food stamp or comparable program eligibility or benefits. (Sec. 5) Repeals the prohibition on an alien's derivative food stamp eligibility based upon supplemental security income eligibility. (Sec. 6) States that with respect to a sponsor affidavit of support means-tested public benefit does not include food stamps. (Sec. 7) Amends the Food Stamp Act to make Cuban or Haitian refugee entrants eligible for food stamps.</summary>
