Expands the asset class over which a parent company may exercise more than five percent control without losing such exemption. Repeals the restrictions placed upon banks under such exempt holding companies' control. Permits a parent holding company to retain such exemption if it acquires an insured institution that has been found by Federal or State authority to be undercapitalized. Revises divestiture requirements to cite circumstances under which the parent holding company may regain a lost exemption from treatment as a bank holding company."
