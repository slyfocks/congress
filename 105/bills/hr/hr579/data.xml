Establishes the Earthquake, Volcanic Eruption, and Hurricane Loss Mitigation Advisory Committee. Requires development of loss-reduction criteria for State and local land use and management ordinances, building codes, and other measures.

Provides State assistance for development and implementation of mitigation plans. Prohibits making, increasing, extending, or renewing any federally-related mortgage loan secured by: (1) residential property in an earthquake-prone, volcanic eruption-prone, or hurricane-prone State unless the property is covered by earthquake and volcanic eruption insurance coverage under this Act or equivalent private insurance; or (2) improved real estate or a mobile home located in an earthquake-prone or volcanic eruption-prone State if the State is not in compliance with the loss-reduction criteria of this Act and the property does not meet minimum mitigation criteria. Title II: Primary Insurance Program - Requires the FEMA Director to establish a Primary Insurance Program (Program) to provide national coverage for residential property (and related personal property) losses in earthquake-prone, volcanic eruption-prone, or hurricane-prone States. Establishes: (1) the Earthquake, Volcanic Eruption, and Hurricane Insurance and Reinsurance Advisory Committee; and (2) the Residential Property Insurance Fund in the Treasury. Title III: National Earthquake, Volcanic Eruption, and Hurricane Excess Loss Reinsurance Program - Requires the FEMA Director to make reinsurance and excess reinsurance available to private insurers participating in the Program and their reinsurers. Provides for the excess reinsurance liability of the insurance industry and the Federal Government. Establishes in the Treasury the Reinsurance Fund to carry out the excess loss reinsurance program. Requires the FEMA Director, to the extent that the Reinsurance Fund is insufficient to pay claims and expenses, to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations to cover the insufficiency.</summary>
