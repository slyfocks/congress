  <summary>11/4/1997--Reported to Senate amended.
Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a pilot project on Federal lands within the Plumas, Lassen, and (the Sierraville Ranger District of) Tahoe National Forests, California, to demonstrate the effectiveness of specified fire resiliency resource management activities recommended by the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability proposal. Exempts spotted owl habitat and protected areas within the project area from such required activities and timber harvesting. Provides for riparian and roadless area protection. Limits: (1) annual project acreage; (2) funding sources; (3) project duration; and (4) report expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth status and final reporting provisions. Directs the Alternative Agricultural Research and Commercialization Corporation (established under the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990) to evaluate the advisability of making commercialization assistance loans for at least two demonstration projects to convert wood waste or low-quality wood byproducts into higher value products.</summary>
