  <summary>6/12/1997--Introduced.
Staffing Firm Worker Benefits Act of 1997 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to define "employer," in the case of a qualified staffing firm, as the employer of individuals performing services for a customer of the firm for purposes of provisions relating to: (1) collection of income tax at source on wages; (2) the Federal Insurance Contributions Act; and (3) the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. Defines a "qualified staffing firm" as any person engaged in providing staffing services to a customer under a service contract if, regarding a worker performing services for the customer covered by the contract, the firm has responsibility for payment of wages, handles withholding taxes and benefits, has authority to hire, reassign and dismiss, maintains employee records, and has responsibility for addressing the worker's complaints, claims, filings, or employment-related requests. (Sec. 3) Includes in the definition of "employee," for specified provisions relating to various employee benefits, any individual whose employer is a qualified staffing firm. Treats certain changes in the employment relationship between an individual and a qualified staffing firm (or its customer or former customer) as a termination of employment from the firm (or the customer). (Sec. 4) Treats a leased employee as an employee of the recipient of the employee's services and treats contributions or benefits provided by the recipient as provided by the recipient for purposes of provisions relating to qualified pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans. Sets forth special rules applicable to the leasing organization's plans. (Sec. 5) Revises leased employee safe harbor requirements.</summary>
