    "text": "Amends the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 to authorize appropriations for FY 1998 and 1999 to: (1) the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to carry out the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior for such responsibilities as may be assigned to the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) under such Act, with specified funds earmarked for the Global Seismic Network and for carrying out a competitive, peer-reviewed program under which FEMA, in close coordination with and as a complement to related activities of the USGS, awards grants to, or enters into cooperative agreements with, State and local governments and persons or entities from the academic community and the private sector. Earmarks funds for responsibilities under such Act for FY 1998 and 1999 for: (1) the National Science Foundation (NSF) for engineering research and geosciences research; and (2) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Requires the Director of USGS to: (1) conduct and report to the Congress on a program to develop a prototype real-time seismic warning system; and (2) provide for an assessment of and report to the Congress on regional seismic monitoring networks in the United States. Authorizes the Director of NSF to use funds made available under such Act to develop and make available to schools and local educational agencies for use by schools, at a minimal cost, earth science teaching materials that are designed to meet the needs of elementary and secondary school teachers and students. Requires the Director to conduct and report to the Congress on a project to improve the seismic hazard assessment of seismic zones. Requires the Director of FEMA to report to the Congress on the need for additional Federal disaster-response training capabilities that are applicable to earthquake response. Requires NSF, FEMA, USGS, and NIST to jointly develop a comprehensive plan for earthquake engineering research to effectively use existing testing facilities and laboratories, upgrade facilities and equipment as needed, and integrate new, innovative testing approaches to the research infrastructure in a systematic manner."
