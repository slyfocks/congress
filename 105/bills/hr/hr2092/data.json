Denies this exception to (thereby withholding the U.S. share of assistance for IAEA projects at) the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant near Cienfuegos, Cuba, or the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center, unless Cuba ratifies certain nuclear weapon nonproliferation treaties and incorporates internationally accepted nuclear safety standards. Directs the Secretary of State to instruct the U.S. representative to the IAEA to oppose IAEA projects at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant and the Pedro Pi Nuclear Research Center (including any other IAEA project in Cuba that is, or could become, a threat to the security of the United States). Requires specified reports."
