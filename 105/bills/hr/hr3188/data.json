    "text": "Prohibits construction of any monument, memorial, or other structure on the parcel of Federal land located south of Rosslyn, Virginia, and north of the Arlington National Cemetery that is bounded on the west by Meade Street, on the north by Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50), on the east by Jefferson Davis Highway (Virginia Route 110), and on the south by Marshall Drive (site of the Iwo Jima Memorial). Exempts from application of this Act: (1) the United States Marine Corps (Iwo Jima) Memorial and the Netherlands Carillon; and (2) the construction, reconstruction, or repair of below-grade utility facilities, including sewer, electrical, water supply, and communications facilities. Allows an individual to bring a civil action in the appropriate U.S. district court against any person (including the United States) to enforce this Act. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, upon receipt from the Chairman of the Air Force Memorial Foundation of adequate documentation of design expenses associated with the United States Air Force Memorial proposed to be located on the parcel, subject to appropriation, to transfer to the Foundation such amount as the Secretary finds necessary to fully reimburse the Association for all site specific design expenses incurred by it prior to September 17, 1997, with respect to such proposed memorial. Authorizes appropriations."
