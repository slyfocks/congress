Requires suspension of any agent, upon conviction for such an offense for the first time, from representing any student athlete who attends the college or university in which the student athlete who was the subject of agent-initiated contact is enrolled. Requires suspension of any agent, upon conviction of any subsequent offense, from representing any student athlete, and makes that agent guilty of a Class C felony and subject to a fine under specified Federal law. Establishes requirements for contracts between athlete agents and student athletes, including the specific wording of a warning to student-athletes about risks of loss of eligibility and other disciplinary actions."
