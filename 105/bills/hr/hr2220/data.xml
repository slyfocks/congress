  <summary>7/22/1997--Introduced.
Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Restoration Act of 1997 - Provides that a remarriage before November 1, 1990, of a veteran's surviving spouse shall not bar the furnishing of dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) to such person if the remarriage is terminated by death or divorce, unless the Secretary of Veterans Affairs determines that the divorce was secured through fraud by the surviving spouse or collusion. Provides the same protection to a surviving spouse who was living with another person before such date and who subsequently ceases to live with such person. Limits the DIC rate payable to such individuals to 50 percent of the rate provided to other surviving spouses. Directs the Secretary to notify such individuals of their DIC eligibility.</summary>
