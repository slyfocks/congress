    "text": "Safe Schools Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Attorney General to: (1) make grants to States, local governments, Indian tribal governments, and other public and private entities and multijurisdictional or regional consortia thereof, to increase police presence, and expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community, to address crime and disorder problems in and around schools; (2) give preferential consideration for such grants to applications for hiring and rehiring additional career law enforcement officers that involve a non-Federal contribution exceeding a 25 percent minimum; and (3) provide technical assistance to further the purposes of this Act. Limits the costs of a program, project, or activity provided by such a grant to 75 percent, unless the Attorney General waives the requirement of a non-Federal contribution. Directs that the Federal share decrease from year to year for up to five years, in relation to a grant for a period exceeding one year for hiring or rehiring career law enforcement officers, looking toward the continuation of the increased hiring level using State or local sources of funding following the conclusion of Federal support. Terminates authority for grants to hire officers after six years. Directs the Attorney General, prior to the expiration of such authority, to report to the Congress. Authorizes the use of grants under this Act to: (1) rehire law enforcement officers who have been laid off as a result of State and local budget reductions for deployment in school-based policing; and (2) hire and train new, additional career law enforcement officers for deployment in school-based policing across the Nation. Sets forth application requirements, including requirements that applications demonstrate a specific public safety need and specify plans for obtaining necessary support and continuing the proposed activity following the conclusion of Federal support. Authorizes the Attorney General to waive specified requirements and make special provisions to facilitate the expedited submission, processing, and approval of applications of local government or law enforcement agencies having jurisdiction over areas with populations of less than 50,000. Sets forth provisions regarding monitoring and evaluation of activities funded under this Act and revocation or suspension of funding. Authorizes appropriations."
