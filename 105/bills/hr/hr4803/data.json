    "text": "Electronic Duck Stamp Act of 1998 - Amends Federal law to allow the Department of the Interior, the Postal Service, or a State or person authorized to sell Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps to issue the stamps, or representations of such stamps, electronically by endorsement affixed to licenses issued at points of sale or through other electronic media. Prohibits such States or persons from participating in the electronic issuance of such a stamp unless the Secretary of the Interior has received a plan submitted by the party in question which provides for a satisfactory accounting process for the collection and transfer of revenue, distribution, and law enforcement verification of the electronic transaction, and the subsequent distribution of the actual stamp. Requires such States or persons, not later than 14 days after the issuance of an electronic stamp, to transfer to the Department or designated agent the revenue collected from the issuance by means of an electronic fund transfer method approved by, and compatible with, the Department's or the designated agent's accounting system."
