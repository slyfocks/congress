Amends other Federal law concerning the endorsement of a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement to permit a freight vessel that was not built in the United States to be endorsed with a coastwise endorsement if the vessel is eligible for documentation and is otherwise qualified, but only with respect to the deepwater transportation of the types of cargo listed above."
