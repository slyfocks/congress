    "text": "Rights of the Child Act of 1997 - Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should submit and seek the advice and consent of the Senate by December 31, 1998, to ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. (Sec. 4) Directs the Attorney General, before such submission, to meet with the attorneys general of the States and U.S. territories to determine their recommendations concerning any limitations that should accompany a proposed resolution of ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. (Sec. 5) Establishes an advisory commission concerning the economic, social, cultural, political, and civil rights of children. Directs the commission to report to the Congress any recommendations agreed to by a majority of its members on any limitations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child advisable to facilitate ratification. (Sec. 6) Authorizes additional appropriations for U.S. contributions to: (1) the International Labor Organization for the activities of the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor; and (2) the U.N. Commission on Human Rights for programs relating to bonded child labor that are carried out by the Subcommittee and Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery. (Sec. 7) Prohibits the importation into the United States of any product manufactured or mined, in whole or in part, by bonded child labor. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations to carry out this prohibition. (Sec. 8) Prohibits U.S. assistance to the government of a foreign country for any fiscal year unless the President certifies to the Congress for such fiscal year that such government has enacted, and is enforcing, laws against child prostitution and the sexual exploitation of children. Authorizes waivers of such prohibition in the national security interest of the United States."
