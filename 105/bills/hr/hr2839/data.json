    "text": "Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act - Mandates that a Federal agency that either operates, or contracts for operation of, a child care center in a facility owned or leased by an executive agency obtain the appropriate State and local licenses and comply with child care licensing requirements. Directs the Administrator of General Services to: (1) establish and enforce child care health, safety and facility standards; and (2) require child care center compliance with accreditation standards issued by a nationally recognized accreditation organization approved by the Administrator. Prescribes enforcement procedures. Instructs the Architect of the Capitol and the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to promulgate regulations for child care centers in legislative and judicial facilities which are no less stringent than those issued by the Administrator. Confers upon the Architect and the Director child care center duties and authorities comparable to those of the Administrator. Provides for technical assistance, studies, and reviews in order to assist child care center operator compliance with this Act. Instructs the Administrator to establish an interagency council to facilitate cooperation and coordinate policy regarding the provision of child care in the Federal Government. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Secretaries of Education, of Housing and Urban Development, and of Labor, and the Attorney General to ensure that any child care made available under any Federal financial assistance program shall be provided by an accredited child care center or a credentialed child care professional. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 to authorize the use of community development block grants to establish accredited child care centers by upgrading existing child care facilities to meet standards for accredited child care centers or by renovating existing structures for use as accredited child care centers."
