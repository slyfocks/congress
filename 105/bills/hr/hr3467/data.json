Directs the Service: (1) before implementation of the preferred alternative, to evaluate and modify the assessment regarding fire and fuels reduction contained in the revised draft EIS to address the concerns raised in the December 1997 final report of the panel of scientists that was appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to review the revised draft EIS; (2) within 18 months, to complete a final EIS and record of decision; and (3) within 12 months, to issue a proposed final EIS for public comment and review. Specifies that: (1) nothing in this Act shall preclude the Service from developing a long-term conservation strategy for the Sierra Nevada Mountains; and (2) the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report every six months describing the Service's progress toward completion of the final EIS within the specified time periods."
