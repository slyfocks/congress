Directs that such study include consideration of factors including: (1) the traffic infraction that led to the stop; (2) the race, ethnicity, and age of the individual stopped; (3) whether a search was instituted and the rationale for, method of, and contraband discovered in, the search; (4) whether a warning, citation, or arrest resulted; and (5) the benefit of traffic stops with regard to the interdiction of drugs and the proceeds of drug trafficking. Prohibits the data from: (1) being used for other than research or statistical purposes or in any legal or administrative proceeding to establish an inference of discrimination on the basis of particular identifying characteristics; or (2) containing any information that may reveal the identity of individuals stopped or law enforcement officers. Directs the Attorney General to report the results of the study to the Congress."
