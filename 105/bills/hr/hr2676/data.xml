(Sec. 9003) Directs the Secretary to: (1) collect and disseminate information, foster educational programs, and conduct research, and study techniques, on protecting historic covered bridges from rot, fire, natural disasters, or weight-related damage; and (2) make grants to applicant States demonstrating a need for assistance to rehabilitate or repair, or preserve, one or more historic covered bridges. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary, upon request by the Mayor of the District of Columbia, to approve Interstate System (IS) substitute highway and transit projects (with an 85 percent Federal share of costs) in lieu of construction of the Barney Circle Freeway project. Amends Federal law to repeal the requirement that State bond interest be included in the Federal share of costs on the construction of Interstate and National Highway System projects. Requires any Federal-aid highway funds released by the final payment on a project (or by modification of the project agreement) to be credited to the same program funding category previously apportioned to the State and be immediately available for expenditure.
