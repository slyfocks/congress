  <summary>6/26/1997--Introduced.
Racial and Gender Preference Reform Act - Prescribes an alternative program for providing a benefit or employment preference under Federal law, as a substitute for any program with race, gender, or national origin as a basis for granting a benefit or a preference that has been invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction. Requires the official responsible for the invalidated program to determine on a case-by-case basis which individuals qualify, according to specified low-opportunity circumstances, and not as members of a group, to be individuals of special achievement who have overcome particularly high obstacles to achieve the qualifications relevant for the position or benefit being sought.</summary>
