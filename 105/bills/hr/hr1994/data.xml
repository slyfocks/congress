  <summary>6/19/1997--Introduced.
Revises Federal provisions establishing the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore to eliminate the requirements that a person owning improved property included within the Lakeshore's boundaries must have owned such property on October 1, 1991, and must have made a bona fide written offer not later than October 1, 1997, to sell the property to the Secretary of the Interior in order to retain a right of occupancy and use of such property for noncommercial residential purposes for a fixed term not to extend beyond October 1, 2020. Provides that for purposes of provisions authorizing the acquisition for the Lakeshore of lands outside the Lakeshore boundaries, lands may be considered contiguous if they touch or are separated from lakeshore lands by only a public or private right-of-way such as a road, railroad, or utility corridor. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire lands within the boundaries of the Lakeshore from State or local government units by satisfaction of delinquent State or local taxes.</summary>
