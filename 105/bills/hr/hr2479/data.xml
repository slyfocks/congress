  <summary>9/16/1997--Introduced.
Instructs the Secretary of Energy to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the extent and manner of plutonium migration from each test location at the Nevada Test Site; (2) the extent of its expected future migration; and (3) the potential for current and future human exposure and possible health risks to communities. Urges that such study consider: (1) all future potential routes of exposure, such as use of contaminated groundwater as drinking water; and (2) potential future trends in population growth over the next 1,000 years in the Nevada Test Site vicinity.</summary>
