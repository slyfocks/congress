Bandelier National Monument Administrative Improvement and Watershed Protection Act of 1998 - Modifies the boundaries of the Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico, to include specified lands within the Upper Alamo watershed. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, within the boundaries of such added areas, to acquire lands by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or transfer with another Federal agency. Prohibits any lands or interests therein from being acquired except with the consent of the owner. Allows lands owned by New Mexico or a political subdivision thereof to be acquired only by donation or exchange. Authorizes the Secretary to acquire less than fee simple interests in land only if the Secretary determines that such acquisition will adequately protect the Monument from flooding, erosion, and degradation of its drainage waters. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
