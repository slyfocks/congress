  <summary>11/8/1997--Introduced.
ESRD Continuous Quality Improvement Program Act of 1997 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a specified quality improvement (CQI) program under Medicare for providers of services and end stage renal disease (ESRD) dialysis facilities under which outstanding providers and facilities will be rewarded and providers and facilities in need of additional training will receive such training through network administrative organizations (NAOs). Requires the Secretary to: (1) publish in the Federal Register specified ESRD Core Indicators; (2) establish a standard information management system to promote the electronic transfer of data obtained under the CQI Program among providers, facilities, the Secretary, and NAOs; and (3) identify those dialysis facilities and physicians that are two standard deviations above the national norm for a preponderance of ESRD Core Indicators on a case severity adjusted basis for two consecutive reporting periods, and designate them as Medicare Dialysis Providers of Achievement. Requires the Secretary or the appropriate NAO to: (1) notify any facility or physician two deviations below the national norm for a preponderance of ESRD Core Indicators on a case severity adjusted basis for two consecutive reporting periods; and (2) develop strategies to improve services and provide appropriate training in CQI Program processes. Requires providers and facilities to participate in a CQI program in order to receive payment under Medicare. Directs the Secretary to: (1) analyze the financial impact of the establishment of such quality improvement program on ESRD NAOs; and (2) submit to the Congress recommendations appropriate to assist the organizations meeting their responsibilities under such program.</summary>
