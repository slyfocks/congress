  <summary>5/6/1997--Introduced.
Community Broadcasting Protection Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe regulations to establish a class A license for qualifying low-power television (LPT) stations. Requires notification of LPT licensees of the availability of such license. Defines as a qualifying LPT station one which in the 90 days preceding enactment of this Act: (1) broadcast for at least 18 hours per day; (2) broadcast for at least three hours weekly programming that was produced within the community of license of such station; and (3) complied with other requirements applicable to LPT stations. Allows the FCC to treat non-qualifying stations as LPT stations under this Act if public interest, convenience, and necessity would be so served. Provides that: (1) the FCC is not required to issue any additional licenses for advanced television services to the licensees of class A television stations; and (2) no licensee of a class A television station shall be required to cease operations, or have a license rescinded or terminated, due to the implementation of amendments to the table of allotments adopted before the enactment of this Act. Allows the FCC to order such a cessation, rescission, or termination only after compliance with specified requirements.</summary>
