Subtitle C: Enhanced Security - Revises certain formulas for determining payments with respect to benefits guarantees (increasing the guaranteed amounts) under certain insolvent multiemployer plans. (Sec. 522) Directs the Secretary of Labor, as chairman of the PBGC board, to send a reversion report to the President and the Congress on plans from which residual assets were distributed to employers. (Sec. 523) Sets forth a full funding limitation for multiemployer plans under ERISA. (Sec. 524) Increases maximum civil penalties for certain prohibited transactions under ERISA.

Requires a plan administrator to notify the Secretary of Labor, within five business days, of: (1) irregularities that may have occurred with respect to the plan; and (2) the termination of the plan's accountant. Requires plan accountants to notify the Secretary of: (1) such irregularities, if the administrator does not do so; and (2) any disagreements they may have with the reasons given by the administrator for their termination. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of such requirements. (Sec. 534) Sets forth additional requirements for qualified public accountants for plans under ERISA. (Sec. 535) Revises ERISA provisions for fiduciary penalties to: (1) modify a prohibition of assignment or alienation; (2) make discretionary the imposition and amount of civil penalties for breach of fiduciary responsibility; and (3) provide for the applicable recovery amount and other rules. Title VI: Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts to Increase Coverage and Portability - Subtitle A: Retirement Savings Incentives - Amends the IRC with respect to deductions from gross income for contributions to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and retirement savings to: (1) increase the applicable dollar amount component in the formulas for certain income limitations; (2) require inflation adjustments to the deductible amount and income limitations; (3) require coordination of the IRA deduction limit with the elective deferral limit; and (4) provide for establishment of special nondeductible tax-free IRAs.
