Repeals the exception to such standards for an individual who, pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person, provides services for such other person as an engineer, designer, drafter, computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker (technical worker) engaged in a similar line of work. (Thus, restores the standards used for determining whether technical workers are not employees as in effect before the Tax Reform Act of 1986.)"
