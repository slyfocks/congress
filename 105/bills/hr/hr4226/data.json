    "text": "Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1998 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (the Act) to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes to purchase bullet resistant equipment for use by law enforcement officers. Sets forth provisions regarding permissible uses of grant funds, preferential consideration, minimum and maximum allocations, matching funds, awards to local governmental units with fewer than 100,000 residents, and application requirements. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001. (Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of the Congress that entities receiving assistance under this Act should purchase only American-made equipment and products. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to: (1) conduct research and otherwise work to develop new bullet resistant technologies for use in police equipment; (2) inventory bullet resistant technologies used in the private sector, in surplus military property, and by foreign countries; and (3) promulgate relevant standards for, and conduct technical and operational testing and evaluation of, bullet resistant technology and equipment, and otherwise facilitate the use of that technology in police equipment. Directs NIJ to give priority in testing and engineering surveys to law enforcement partnerships developed in coordination with High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001."
