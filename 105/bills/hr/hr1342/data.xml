  <summary>4/29/1997--Passed House amended.
Authorizes a one-year conservation reserve program (CRP) enrollment (to begin October 1, 1997) for land covered by a CRP contract expiring in FY 1997 if: (1) such land is eligible CRP land, had a wheat, oats, or barley crop acreage base, and is located in an area where fall-seeded crops are regularly planted; and (2) the owner submitted an enrollment bid during the March 28, 1997 enrollment period. States that: (1) such one-year enrollment shall be considered part of any subsequent long-term enrollment, but shall not take effect if the March 28, 1997 enrollment has been completed prior to enactment of this Act; and (2) the maximum FY 1998 CRP enrollment shall be 30 million acres. Authorizes specified owners or operators who did not bid for contract extensions to terminate an expiring FY 1997 CRP contract anytime after June 30, 1997, without any rental payment reduction.</summary>
