Directs the Secretary of the Interior to allow a herd of 100 free roaming horses in the Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina.

Prohibits the Secretary from removing or assisting in or permitting the removal of any free roaming horses from Federal lands within the Seashore: (1) unless the entity with whom the Secretary has entered into the agreement fails to meet the terms and conditions of the agreement; (2) unless the number of such horses exceeds 110; or (3) except in the case of an emergency or to protect public health and safety. Requires the Secretary to annually monitor, assess, and make available to the public findings regarding the population, structure, and health of such horses.</summary>
