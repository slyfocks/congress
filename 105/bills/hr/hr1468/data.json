Exempts such aliens from: (1) attribution of sponsor income and repayment requirements; and (2) the five-year ineligibility period for Federal means-tested public benefits. Makes permanent resident aliens who are at least 76 years old eligible for SSI benefits. Exempts such aliens from sponsor repayment requirements."
