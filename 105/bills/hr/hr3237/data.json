Prohibits the release of identifying information about a birth parent to the adopted child unless the parent and child have signed a notarized statement of consent. Mandates: (1) the confidentiality of all national registry information; and (2) the written informed consent of the individual before release of any registry information. Proscribes any national registry attempt to contact an individual for the purpose of facilitating a reunion. Mandates that the registry: (1) be a centralized nationwide data repository; and (2) operate independently of any other data system maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. Authorizes the Secretary to charge fees for services provided under this Act. Subjects violators of this Act to specified criminal penalties. Declares that this Act does not preempt any State or local law concerning adoption and the confidentiality of its sealed adoption record policy."
