Requires the Federal Coordination Council to submit to the Congress: (1) not later than one year after the designation of the Council, a report detailing any legislative encumbrances preventing the Council from carrying out its duties; and (2) not later than three years after the designation of the Council, a report detailing any regulations implemented as a result of the Council's findings."
