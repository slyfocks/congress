Family Services Improvement Act of 1997 - Directs the President to designate a Federal Coordination Council composed of various specified cabinet secretaries and other Federal agency heads to perform a variety of specified functions for the stated purposes of: (1) removing Federal impediments to coordination of service delivery; (2) enabling more efficient use of Federal, State, and local resources through program coordination and reduction of regulation; (3) facilitating cooperation among and coordination of programs operated by State, local, and tribal governments and private, nonprofit organizations; (4) identifying at least ten qualified consortia of such organizations and State or local agencies that receive federally appropriated funds, together with representatives of specified services, to participate in a demonstration program to determine the benefits of specified accountability procedures; and (5) placing less emphasis in Federal service programs on measuring resources and procedures and more emphasis on accountability for achieving policy goals. Requires the Federal Coordination Council to submit to the Congress: (1) not later than one year after the designation of the Council, a report detailing any legislative encumbrances preventing the Council from carrying out its duties; and (2) not later than three years after the designation of the Council, a report detailing any regulations implemented as a result of the Council's findings.</summary>
