Requires electronic filing of FEC reports beginning January 1, 1999, with the exception of reports filed by a political committee reporting less than the designated threshold amount of contributions or expenditures during the election cycle for which the report is filed. Specifies the threshold amount as: (1) for an authorized committee, $50,000; or (2) for any other political committee, such amount as the FEC may establish by regulation. Directs the FEC to develop and make available without charge any computer software required for the electronic filing of FEC reports. Makes the information contained in FEC reports available on the Internet. Prohibits the use of Internet information for commercial purposes or for soliciting contributions."
