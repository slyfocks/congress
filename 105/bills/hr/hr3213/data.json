Empowers U.S. district courts to hear cases commenced against a State or private employer by the United States on behalf of such veterans, or against a private employer by a person. Requires direct payment to the veteran of any claim compensation which is considered lost wages or benefits or liquidated damages. Includes within the definition of \"employee,\" for purposes of employment and reemployment rights, any person who is a citizen, national, or permanent resident alien of the United States employed in a foreign workplace by an employer that is an entity incorporated or otherwise organized in the United States or that is controlled by an entity organized in the United States. Provides that if a U.S. employer controls a foreign entity, then any denial of employment, reemployment, or benefits by such foreign entity shall be presumed to be by such employer. Provides an exception when employer compliance would violate the law of the foreign country in which the workplace is located. Authorizes a veteran claiming employment or reemployment rights to request the Secretary to refer such complaint to the Merit Systems Protection Board (current law), without regard to whether such complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994 (the effective date of such provision)."
