  <summary>4/29/1997--Introduced.
Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate a specified segment of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River in Washington State as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Provides that only public land adjacent to the segment, and no privately-owned land, shall be included in it. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) manage the segment as a recreational river; and (2) meet specified criteria in developing and periodically revising a plan for the management of the segment. Retains access corridors in existence on the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers in cooperation and coordination with the heads of relevant Federal agencies and State and local governments, to develop a comprehensive plan of improvement for restoration and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, river access, and overall aesthetics of the levees and other rivershore areas downstream of the segment in the Tri-Cities area of Washington State. Requires the Secretary, acting through the Chief and subject to receipt of a statement of interest from the non-Federal interests for the following projects, to complete a preliminary restoration plan under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 for: (1) a portion of the Clover Island rivershore and a portion of the levee immediately upstream of Clover Island; (2) the rivershore immediately upstream of the portion in the city of Kennewick, Washington, to the U.S. Route 395 bridge; (3) the levee modified in 1994 between Road 39 and the U.S. Route 395 bridge in Franklin County, Washington; and (4) the levee between the U.S. Route 395 bridge to the area immediately downstream of the 10th Avenue bridge in the city of Pasco, Washington. Directs the Secretary, subject to the receipt of necessary commitments from the non-Federal interests, to complete a modification report for each project.</summary>
