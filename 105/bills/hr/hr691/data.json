    "text": "Directs the Chief Justice of the United States to assign three circuit court judges or justices to a division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to determine whether an action brought in a U.S. court for compensation for services performed for the United States pursuant to a secret Government contract may be tried by the court. Prohibits the division from determining that the case cannot be heard solely on the basis of the nature of the services to be provided under the contract. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) justice or judge assignment, terms, and vacancies; (2) the court's determination of whether the information that would be disclosed in adjudicating the action would do serious damage to U.S. national security or would compromise the safety and security of intelligence sources (allows the division to prescribe steps to protect national security and intelligence sources and methods, including holding proceedings in camera); (3) case referral; (4) the effect of the division's determination; (5) other judicial assignments; and (6) support services. Makes this Act applicable to claims arising on or after December 1, 1976. Waives the statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to claims arising before enactment of this Act, provided an action is brought on such claim with two years after enactment of this Act."
