(Sec. 101) Requires State, district, or local committees of political parties (including specified related entities) to make expenditures and disbursements for Federal election activities (with exceptions) from funds subject to FECA requirements. Subjects to FECA requirements any amounts spent for fundraising costs of Federal election activities by national, State, district, or local committees and specified related entities.

Prohibits candidates, incumbents, or their agents from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending funds for Federal election activities on their behalf (with exceptions), unless the funds are subject to FECA requirements. (Sec. 102) Prohibits any person from making contributions to a State committee in any year that exceed, in the aggregate, $10,000. Increases the aggregate individual contribution limit from $25,000 to $30,000. (Sec. 103) Requires: (1) national committees, national congressional campaign committees, and any subordinate committees, to report all receipts and disbursements during the reporting period; (2) State, district, and local committees to report all receipts and disbursements made for specified Federal election activities; and (3) political committees having receipts or disbursements from persons in excess of $200 for any year to separately itemize their reporting for such persons. Title II: Independent and Coordinated Expenditures - Redefines the term \"independent expenditure\" to mean an expenditure by a person for: (1) a communication that is express advocacy; and (2) that is not provided in coordination with a candidate or a candidate's agent, or a person who is coordinating with a candidate or a candidate's agent. Defines the term \"express advocacy.\" (Sec. 201) Redefines the term \"expenditure\" to include: (1) a payment for a communication that is express advocacy; and (2) a payment made by a person for a communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate, is provided in coordination with the candidate, the candidate's agent, or the candidate's political party, and is for the purpose of influencing a Federal election (regardless of whether the communication is express advocacy). (Sec. 202) Provides that in determining whether any communication by television or radio broadcast constitutes express advocacy for purposes of this Act, there shall not be taken into account any background music not including lyrics used in such broadcast. (Sec. 203) Prohibits the Federal Election (Commission) from entering into a conciliation agreement if it determines that there is probable cause to believe that a person has made a knowing and willful violation involving the reporting of an independent expenditure.

(Sec. 204) Sets forth reporting requirements for certain independent expenditures made by persons (including political committees) aggregating: (1) $1,000 or more after the 20th day before an election; and (2) $10,000 or more up to or on the 20th day before an election. Requires additional reports to be filed each time such independent expenditures are made. Requires such reports to: (1) be filed with the Commission; and (2) contain the information required for a person who receives any disbursement in excess of $200 in connection with an independent expenditure, including the name of each candidate to whom an expenditure is intended to support or oppose. (Sec. 205) Prohibits a committee of a political party, on or after the date on which the political party nominates a candidate, from making both coordinated and independent expenditures to the candidate during the election cycle. Requires a political party committee, before making a coordinated expenditure to a candidate, to certify to the Commission that it has not and shall not make any independent expenditure to the candidate during the same election cycle. Prohibits a political party committee that submits a certification with respect to a candidate from transferring any funds to, assigning authority to make coordinated expenditures to, or receiving a transfer of funds from, a political committee of the party that has made or intends, during the same election cycle, to make an independent expenditure to the candidate. (Sec. 206) Redefines the term \"contribution\" to include anything of value provided by a person in coordination with a candidate for the purpose of influencing a Federal election, regardless of whether the value being provided is a communication that is express advocacy, in which such candidate seeks nomination or election to Federal office. Considers a thing of value provided in coordination with a candidate as a contribution to the candidate, and in the case of a limitation on expenditures, treats it as an expenditure by the candidate. Redefines the term \"contribution or expenditure\" with respect to contributions or expenditures by national banks, corporations, and labor organizations, to include a contribution or expenditure as defined under this Act. Title III: Disclosure - Replaces provisions permitting the filing of reports electronically with provisions requiring the Commission to: (1) promulgate a regulation for the filing of reports using computers and faxes; (2) make electronically filed reports publicly accessible on the Internet within 24 hours after their receipt by it; and (3) provide methods (other than requiring a signature on the filing) for verifying covered reports.

(Sec. 307) Requires filing of a certain statement with the Commission by persons, other than political committees and religious and apostolic organizations, that make aggregate disbursements in excess of $50,000 per year for specified Federal election activities: (1) on a monthly basis; or (2) within 24 hours, in the case of disbursements made within 20 days of an election. Exempts from such filing requirements: (1) a candidate or a candidate's authorized committees; and (2) independent expenditures. (Sec. 308) Revises requirements for publication and distribution of any print, broadcast, or general public political advertising. Title IV: Personal Wealth Option - Directs the Commission to issue a certification that a Senate or House of Representatives candidate is an eligible primary or general election congressional candidate if the candidate files with it a declaration that the candidate and the candidate's authorized committees (relevant parties) will not (in the case of a primary candidate) or did not (in the case of a general election candidate) exceed a personal funds expenditure limit of $50,000. Directs the Commission, if the limit is exceeded, to: (1) revoke the certification; and (2) require the relevant parties to pay a penalty to the Commission.

(Sec. 501) Requires a labor organization, with respect to a non-member employee who files an objection under such a procedure, to reduce the employee's payments in lieu of organization dues or fees by an amount which reasonably reflects the ratio that the organization's expenditures supporting political activities unrelated to collective bargaining bear to such organization's total expenditures.

(Sec. 504) Amends the Federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against fundraising on Federal property. Prohibits an officer or employee of the Federal Government, including the President, Vice President, and Members of Congress, from soliciting a donation of money or other thing of value for a political committee or candidate for Federal, State, or local office, from any person while in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties by a Federal officer or employee.

(Sec. 506) Revises the ban on contributions by foreign nationals to change the term to \"noncitizens.\" Provides that it shall not be a defense to a violation of such ban that the defendant did not know that the contribution originated from a foreign national if the defendant should have known that the contribution originated from a foreign national, except that the trier of fact may not find that the defendant should have known that the contribution originated from a foreign national solely because of the contributor's name. (Sec. 507) Prohibits minors (age 17 or younger) from making contributions to candidates or contributions or donations to committees of political parties. (Sec. 508) Permits the Commission to: (1) order expedited proceedings for certain complaints; and (2) refer, at any time, to the Attorney General a possible violation of such Acts. (Sec. 509) Revises the basis for mandatory Commission initiation of enforcement proceedings upon receipt of a complaint alleging a violation of such Acts.

(Sec. 516) Establishes within the Commission a clearinghouse of specified public information on political activities of foreign principals and their agents. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 517) Permits permanent resident aliens serving in the armed forces to make contributions in connection with Federal elections. (Sec. 518) Amends IRC to prohibit presidential and vice presidential candidates from receiving amounts from the Presidential Election Campaign Fund (PECF) unless the candidate certifies that the candidate will not solicit any funds (soft money) for the purposes of influencing such election, including any funds used for an independent expenditure under FECA, unless the funds are subject to FECA requirements. Title VI: Severability; Constitutionality; Effective Date; Regulations - Sets forth provisions concerning severability, review of constitutional issues, effective date, and regulations.
