    "text": "International Military Training Transparency and Accountability Act - Amends the Arms Export Control Act to prohibit the sale, lease, loan, or grant of defense services or training (including Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET)) to any foreign country that is prohibited or restricted from receiving international military education and training (IMET), or other military assistance or arms transfers. Permits a foreign country that is eligible to receive only expanded IMET, and is not prohibited from receiving any other military assistance or arms transfers, to receive defense services and training if it provides for training of civilian officials and military officers of the armed forces on military justice, international human rights standards, and the proper role of such forces in a democratic society. Permits a foreign country otherwise prohibited or restricted from receiving IMET or any other military assistance or arms transfers to receive defense services and training substantially unrelated to the prohibited military assistance or arms transfers, provided the President makes a specified certification to the Congress. Authorizes the President to waive any prohibition under this Act with respect to a foreign country upon certification to the Congress that it is important to the national security of the United States."
