  <summary>3/20/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal aviation law to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring the use of federally-approved child safety restraint systems (including weight or age limits) on commercial aircraft. Prohibits an air carrier from charging a price for a child under age three that exceeds the lowest price charged to any other paying passenger on such commercial flight with the same destination. Expresses the sense of the Congress that air carriers should not charge for transportation of children under age three.</summary>
