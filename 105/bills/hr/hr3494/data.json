(Sec. 102) Increases penalties for: (1) coercing or enticing an individual to travel in interstate or foreign commerce to engage in prostitution or criminal sexual activity (and applies such penalties to attempting to do so); and (2) using any means of interstate or foreign commerce to coerce or entice any individual under age 18 to engage in such activity. (Sec. 103) Increases penalties for: (1) transportation of minors with intent to engage in illegal sexual activity (and applies such penalties to attempting to do so); and (2) travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile. (Sec. 104) Doubles the maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of provisions regarding transportation of a minor for illegal sexual activity after a prior sex offense conviction. (Sec. 105) Includes the production of child pornography within the definition of \"sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.\" (Sec. 106) Modifies the general prohibition against transportation for illegal sexual activity and related crimes to increase penalties and to apply such penalties to attempting such transportation. Title II: Protection of Children From Child Pornography - Provides for the prosecution of individuals for the production of child pornography if the visual depiction was produced with materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, including by computer. Increases penalties for distribution of child pornography or sexual exploitation of children after a previous conviction of transporting another person for illegal sexual activity and related crimes. (Sec. 203) Applies code provisions prohibiting knowingly possessing material containing the visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct to the possession of one or more (currently, three or more) items of such material. Applies provisions prohibiting knowingly possessing child pornography to material containing an image (currently, three or more images) of child pornography. Makes it an affirmative defense to a charge of violating such prohibitions that the defendant: (1) possessed fewer than three such items or images; and (2) promptly and in good faith, without retaining or allowing any person other than a law enforcement agency to access any such visual depiction or image, took reasonable steps to destroy it or reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded that agency access to each such depiction or image. Title III: Sexual Abuse Prevention - Doubles the maximum term of imprisonment for abusive sexual contact with an individual who has not attained age 12. (Sec. 303) Replaces repeat offender provisions with a provision doubling the maximum term of imprisonment after a prior sex offense conviction. Title IV: Prohibition on Transfer of Obscene Material to Minors - Prohibits and sets penalties for: (1) using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to knowingly transfer obscene matter to another individual known to be under age 16; and (2) attempting to do so.
