  <summary>3/6/1997--Introduced.
Deadly Driver Reduction and Burton H. Greene Memorial Act - Amends Federal transportation law to require the Secretary of Transportation to withhold five percent of the funds authorized for Federal aid highway programs for FY 2001, and ten percent of such amounts for subsequent fiscal years, from any State that has not enacted and is not enforcing a law that provides the following minimum sentences for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol: (1) revocation of driver's license for six months, in the case of a first conviction; (2) revocation for one year, in the case of a second conviction; and (3) permanent revocation, in the case of a third or subsequent conviction. Allows funds withheld from a State during FY 2001 to be available for up to three fiscal years after such date (to allow a State to meet such requirement within such period), but allows no grace period with respect to funds withheld during the subsequent fiscal years.</summary>
