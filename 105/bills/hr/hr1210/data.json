Directs the Commission to: (1) identify Amtrak passenger rail routes which are candidates for closure or realignment based on system-wide economic performance rankings and other specified principles and factors; (2) examine ridership forecasts and other assumptions supporting continued service on the Northeast Corridor, particularly with respect to the continuation of the electrification of the Northeast Corridor between New Haven, Connecticut, and Boston, Massachusetts; and (3) examine optional uses for abandoned rail lines. Requires the Commission to report to the Congress and the President on its activities, including recommendations for the closure and realignment of routes in Amtrak's passenger rail system. Sets forth procedures for congressional consideration of Commission recommendations. Authorizes appropriations."
