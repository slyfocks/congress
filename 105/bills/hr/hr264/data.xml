  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
ATM Fee Reform Act of 1997 - Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to mandate fee disclosures at the time of service by any host electronic terminal operator which imposes a fee for providing host transfer services to a consumer. Mandates disclosure at the time the consumer contracts for electronic fund transfer services that fees may be imposed for initiating electronic fund transfers from an electronic terminal which is not operated by the issuer of the consumer's access card. Requires the Comptroller General to study the feasibility of requiring specified fee disclosures before the consumer is irrevocably committed to completing any electronic fund transfer by means of an electronic terminal.</summary>
