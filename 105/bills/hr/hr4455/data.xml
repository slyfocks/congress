  <summary>8/6/1998--Introduced.
Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure Act - Provides that, in any civil action arising under Federal or State law, no Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure (a statement concerning Year 2000 computer compliance information) (Y2K problem) shall be admissible unless the proponent of admissibility establishes that the Disclosure was material and: (1) the Disclosure was made with knowledge of its being false and misleading and with an intent to deceive; or (2) where the Disclosure was a republication of a third party, the republication was made without a disclosure by the maker that the Disclosure is based on a republication and that the maker has not verified the original statement. Provides similar requirements for an action based on an allegedly false, inaccurate, or misleading Year 2000 statement. Provides that, in any covered action in which the adequacy of notice about Year 2000 processing is at issue, and except as provided by contract, the posting of notice by the entity purporting to have provided such notice on that entity's Year 2000 Internet Website shall be presumed to be an adequate mechanism for providing such notice. Prohibits in any covered action a Year 2000 Disclosure from being interpreted or construed as an amendment to or alteration of a written contract or warranty, whether entered into by a public or private party (with exceptions). Authorizes a Federal entity, agency, or authority to expressly designate requests for the voluntary provision of information relating to Year 2000 processing as "Special Year 2000 Data Gathering Requests," thereby protecting information received from such requests from: (1) disclosure to any third party, including disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act; and (2) use in any civil action arising under any Federal or State law (with an exception). Provides exclusions from this Act. Makes this Act applicable to any Year 2000 Disclosure made on or after January 1, 1998, through December 31, 2001. Provides for the treatment of prior written disclosures.</summary>
