    "text": "Good Corporate Citizenship and Federal Procurement Incentives Act - Directs Directs the heads of Federal agencies, when entering into contracts to procure goods and services, to give preference to contracting with entities that have adopted certain environmental and fair employment principles under a corporate code of conduct. Requires the Federal Acquisition Regulation to include standards with respect to such preference. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Trade and Development Agency, and the Export-Import Bank of the United States, in providing certain foreign trade and investment assistance, to give preference to entities that have adopted the corporate code of conduct. Declares the sense of the Congress prescribing such code of conduct, including principles with respect to: (1) a safe and healthy workplace; (2) fair employment, including avoidance of child and forced labor, or of discrimination based upon race, gender, national origin, or religious beliefs; (3) the right to organize and bargain collectively; (4) payment of a living wage to all workers; (5) responsible environmental protection and environmental practices; (6) good business practice laws, including laws prohibiting illicit payments and ensuring fair competition; (7) free expression consistent with legitimate business concerns; (8) absence of political coercion in the workplace; (9) ethical conduct is recognized, valued, and exemplified by all employees; (10) contractual requirement of similar behavior by partners, suppliers, and subcontractors; and (11) specified implementation and compliance monitoring procedures. Directs the head of each Federal agency to review and report annually to the Congress on each entity that has received a preference to determine whether it is in compliance with the code. Authorizes any person to file a petition with the Secretary of Commerce requesting the withdrawal, suspension, or limitation of the preference awarded to an entity that is alleged not to be in compliance with the code. Provides for the judicial review of such determinations."
