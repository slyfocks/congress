Regulatory Fair Warning Act of 1998 - Prohibits a Federal agency or court from imposing a sanction for a violation of a rule if the agency or court finds that: (1) the rule was not printed in the Code of Federal Regulations or in the Federal Register, was not known to the person, or was not knowable to a person who has engaged in a reasonable, good faith investigation of the rules applicable to the conduct that allegedly violated the rule; (2) the rule failed to give the person fair warning of the conduct that it prohibits or requires; or (3) with respect only to a retrospective sanction, official representations to the person about what the rule prohibits or requires were misleading and were reasonably relied upon by the person.</summary>
