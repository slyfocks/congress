Requires reports of the panel, including any individual and minority reports, to be published together with any proposed or final rule on the standard. Directs the Secretary to provide a written response to all significant comments of the panel and include such responses with the proposed or final rule to which the reports of the panel members are attached. Makes such requirements inapplicable when the rule is completed through negotiated rulemaking."
