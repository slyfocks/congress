  <summary>11/7/1997--Introduced.
Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to direct the Secretary of Labor, upon determination that a rule should be promulgated or modified in order to serve the objectives of such Act, to appoint an advisory panel to review the scientific and economic data which forms the basis for such standard and the relevance of the data to industries and workers which would be affected by the standard. Requires reports of the panel, including any individual and minority reports, to be published together with any proposed or final rule on the standard. Directs the Secretary to provide a written response to all significant comments of the panel and include such responses with the proposed or final rule to which the reports of the panel members are attached. Makes such requirements inapplicable when the rule is completed through negotiated rulemaking.</summary>
