(Sec. 3) Includes, under provisions for determining whether gaming activities on newly acquired Indian lands are to be allowed, consideration of communities across State borders that would be seriously affected, as well as consultation with officials of such communities. Transfers primary authority to make such determinations from the Secretary of the Interior to the Governor and the State legislature. Authorizes gaming for newly acknowledged or restored tribes under specified circumstances. (Sec. 4) Requires an individual's physical presence in order to participate in class II or class III gaming on Indian lands. (Sec. 5) Sets forth class II and class III gaming restrictions. (Sec. 6) Excludes video bingo from the definition of class II gaming. Includes video bingo and any other forms of electronic video games or devices within the definition of class III gaming. (Sec. 7) Establishes a two-year moratorium on new class III gaming. (Sec. 8) Specifies that in a State whose constitution specifically authorizes class II or class III gaming such gambling on Indian lands shall be subject to the same laws, terms, and conditions as the State's gambling. (Sec. 9) Increases the membership of the National Indian Gaming Commission. (Sec. 10) Subjects Indian gaming establishments to specified reporting and bookkeeping requirements. (Sec. 11) Directs the Attorney General to conduct related background investigations. (Sec. 12) Amends Federal criminal law to extend current State authority in specified States to gaming violations on Indian lands. (Sec. 13) Amends the Act to prohibit the use of appropriated funds for the Commission. Increases gaming fee limits for Commission funding."
