Makes such burial eligibility the exclusive eligibility for Cemetery burial. Prohibits the Secretary of the Army or any other responsible official from considering a request for Cemetery burial made before the death of the individual.

Authorizes the cremated remains of the following persons to be placed in the Cemetery columbarium: (1) a person eligible for burial under this Act; (2) a veteran whose last period of active duty ended honorably; and (3) the spouse, surviving spouse, minor child, or unmarried adult child (discretionary) of such a veteran. Requires Cemetery gravesites to be appropriately marked. Directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations for the provision of headstones or markers at private expense in lieu of headstones and markers provided in the Cemetery by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Prohibits a memorial or marker from being placed in the Cemetery: (1) unless it commemorates the service of the individual or group whose memory is to be honored by such memorial or marker or a particular military event; or (2) until 25 years after a period of service or a particular military event.</summary>
