Prohibits an individual or his or her survivor or beneficiary from being paid annuity or retired pay on the basis of the individual's creditable service if the individual is convicted of an act or ommission: (1) which is a felony under Federal or State law; (2) committed while the individual is a Member of Congress; (3) which occurs in connection with the individual's service as a Member of Congress; and (4) which occurs after the enactment of this Act. Applies the same prohibition to such an individual who: (1) is under indictment after the enactment of this Act for such offense; or (2) willfully remains outside the United States or its territories and possessions for more than one year with knowledge of the indictment or charge. Prohibits interest from being computed on an individual's refund of contributions and deposits paid toward annuity or retired pay if such individual was convicted of such an offense in this Act for the period after the conviction. Authorizes, under specified conditions, the restoration of such annuity or retired pay if the individual is pardoned by the Governor in the case of a felony under State law."
