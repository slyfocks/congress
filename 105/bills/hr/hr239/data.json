Revokes the tax-exemption of such organizations for acts of self-dealing. Prohibits the net earnings of certain civic leagues and local associations from inuring to private shareholders or individuals. Increases the penalty on tax-exempt organizations for failure to file timely annual information returns. Increases the penalty for failure to permit public inspection of such returns.
