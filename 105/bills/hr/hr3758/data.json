Requires the Government, in conveying or licensing exclusive rights to federally funded research, to give consideration to mechanisms for determining reasonable prices based upon a competitive bidding process where bidders compete: (1) based on the lowest prices that will be charged to consumers; (2) based on the least sales revenues before prices are adjusted in accordance with a cost based reasonable pricing formula; (3) based on the least period of time before prices are adjusted in accordance with such a formula; (4) based on the shortest period of exclusivity; or (5) under other competitive bidding systems. Permits such competitive bidding process to incorporate requirements for minimum levels of expenditures on research, marketing, maximum price, or other factors."
