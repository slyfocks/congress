    "text": "Medicare Long-Term Care Hospital Payment Correction Act of 1998 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with regard to calculation of the payment to long-term care hospitals for the operating costs of inpatient hospital services. Requires adjustment, according to a specified formula, of the target amount for such a hospital if the average inpatient length of stay for the two most recent settled cost reporting periods is five percent less than the average inpatient length of stay for the initial 12-month cost reporting period (base year) (thus correcting for overpayments to such hospitals). Amends the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in developing a legislative proposal for establishing a case-mix adjusted prospective payment system for payment of certain long-term care hospitals under Medicare, to consider adjustments in the amount of payments to long-term care hospitals whose average inpatient length of stay during the base year greatly exceeds the hospitals' average inpatient length of stay in later years."
