District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit the income tax imposed on individuals who are residents of the District of Columbia. Specifies that the limitation is the sum of: (1) 15 percent of so much District-sourced income as exceeds the exemption amount; and (2) the average rate of the non-District-sourced adjusted gross income. Sets forth definitions, including for "resident of the District of Columbia" and "exemption amount." Provides for the tax treatment of certain sources of income. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to annually study the impact of the provisions of this Act on the economy of the District of Columbia.</summary>
