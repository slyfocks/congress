  <summary>5/19/1998--Passed House amended.
Mandates Information Act of 1998 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require a congressional committee report on any bill or joint resolution that includes any Federal private sector mandate to contain information concerning the impact of such mandate on consumers, workers, and small businesses, including any disproportionate impact in particular regions or industries. Revises provisions concerning legislation subject to a point of order to: (1) define the point of order for a determination by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office that it is not feasible to determine the economic impact of a Federal mandate; and (2) replace certain references to Federal intergovernmental mandates with references to Federal mandates with respect to legislation reported by the Appropriations Committees. Provides a point of order against consideration of legislation that would increase the direct costs of Federal private sector mandates (excluding direct costs attributable to revenue resulting from tax or tariff provisions of any such measure if it does not raise net tax and tariff revenues over the five-fiscal-year period beginning with the first fiscal year such measure affects such revenues) by an amount that causes the stated threshold of $100 million per fiscal year to be exceeded. Requires the Director, at the request of a Senator, to prepare an estimate of the direct costs of a Federal mandate (currently, Federal intergovernmental mandate) contained in such Senator's amendment. Requires the Director to report to the Congress on the economic impact of the amendments made by this Act to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 on domestic employment and businesses. Redefines "Federal intergovernmental mandate" to provide that a decrease to, or a cap on, an existing Federal program which annually provides $500 million or more entitlement authority is not such a mandate unless it provides new or expanded authority to amend financial or programmatic responsibilities so as to permit required services to continue to be provided.</summary>
