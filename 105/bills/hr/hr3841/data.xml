  <summary>5/12/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income, in the case of any individual who has attained the age of 65, the value of any real property tax reduction voucher. Defines such a voucher as a voucher which: (1) is received from a governmental unit in exchange for the performance, by such an individual, of volunteer services for the benefit of such governmental unit; and (2) may be used to satisfy such individual's real property tax liability to such governmental unit. Prohibits a deduction for any real property tax paid using such a voucher to the extent that the amount of such voucher is excluded from gross income.</summary>
