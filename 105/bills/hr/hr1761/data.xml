(Sec. 102) Amends SSA title XI to condition provider payment under the Medicare, Medicaid (SSA title XIX), and Maternal and Child Health Services (SSA title V) programs on the disclosure to the Secretary of certain applicable employer identification and social security numbers, including those of individuals with an ownership or control interest in the provider.

(Sec. 103) Requires non-physician practitioners to provide diagnostic codes for furnished items or services.

(Sec. 110) Amends the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 to: (1) authorize the availability of National Practitioner Data Bank information to the Inspectors General of the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), of Defense, and of Labor, of the Office of Personnel Management, and of the Railroad Retirement Board; and (2) exempt the HHS Inspector General from fees for such information. (Sec. 111) Amends SSA title XIX to extend the authority of State Medicaid Fraud Control Units to investigate and prosecute: (1) fraud in other Federal health care programs, upon the approval of the relevant Federal agency; and (2) patient abuse in non-Medicaid board and care facilities. (Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary and the Attorney General to take certain steps jointly to ensure that the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is fully reimbursed for any expenditures (unrelated to Medicare administration) made from its account, in excess of enforcement collections, to combat health care waste, fraud, and abuse.
