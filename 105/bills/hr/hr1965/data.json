  "summary": {
    "as": "Reported to House amended, Part I", 
    "date": "1997-10-30", 
    "text": "Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide for the creation of general rules relating to civil forfeiture proceedings. Requires the seizure notice required by an agency under the Tariff Act of 1930 with respect to any nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute to be sent, together with information on the applicable procedures, not later than 60 days after the seizure to each party known to the agency to have an ownership or possessory interest in the seized article. Authorizes: (1) the Government to apply to a Federal magistrate judge for an extension of time to comply under specified circumstances; (2) a person with such an interest who failed to file a claim within the prescribed time period, on motion made within two years after the date of final publication of notice of seizure, to move to set aside a declaration of forfeiture; and (3) a person claiming seized property to file a claim with the appropriate official within 30 days after the date of final publication of notice of seizure or, in the case of a person receiving written notice, the date that such notice is received. Directs the Attorney General, in cases where property has been seized or restrained by the Government and a claim has been filed, to file a complaint for forfeiture in the appropriate court in the manner set forth in the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, or to include a forfeiture count in a criminal indictment or information, or both, not later than 90 days after the claim was filed, or return the property pending the filing of a complaint or indictment. Permits the 90-day filing requirement to be waived by mutual agreement between the Government and the claimants. Authorizes the Government to apply to a Federal magistrate judge in any district where venue for a forfeiture action would lie for an extension of time in which to comply with such requirement, based on a showing of good cause. Specifies that, if the reason for the extension is that the filing would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution or court-authorized electronic surveillance, the application may be ex parte. Directs the claimant, upon the filing of a civil complaint, to file a claim and answer in accordance with the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. Authorizes the court to appoint counsel to represent a person regarding a claim if the person filing the claim is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel and requests that counsel be appointed. Directs the court to consider the nature and value of the property subject to forfeiture, the claimant's standing to contest the forfeiture, and whether the claim appears to be made in good faith or to be frivolous. Sets forth provisions regarding attorney compensation. Places the burden of proof at trial on the United States, in all suits or actions brought for the civil forfeiture of any property, to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture. Places the burden on the claimant, if the Government proves that the property is subject to forfeiture, to establish any affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifies that an innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited in any civil forfeiture action. Sets forth requirements regarding: (1) motions to suppress seized evidence; (2) the use of hearsay at pretrial hearings; (3) stipulations; (4) preservation of property subject to forfeiture; (5) excessive fines; and (6) a pre-discovery standard of forfeitability. Entitles a person who has filed a claim to release of seized property pending trial if: (1) the claimant has a possessory interest in the property sufficient to establish standing to contest forfeiture, has filed a nonfrivolous claim on the merits of the forfeiture action, and has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at time of trial; (2) the continued possession by the Government pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant; (3) the claimant's hardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, diminished in value, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding; and (4) the seized property is not contraband, currency (not constituting business assets), evidence of a violation of law, particularly suited for use in illegal activities, or likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if returned. (Sec. 3) Amends the Federal Tort Claims Act to make such Act applicable to any claim based on the negligent destruction, injury, or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property while in the possession of any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer, if the property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture but the interest of the claimant is not forfeited. Authorizes the Attorney General to settle certain claims, for up to $50,000 per case, for damage to or loss of privately owned property caused by an investigative or law enforcement officer who is employed by the Department of Justice acting within the scope of his or her employment. (Sec. 4) Makes the United States liable for post-judgment interest upon entry of judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seized or arrested under any Act of Congress, but not for prejudgment interest, with exceptions. Specifies that the United States shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized.
