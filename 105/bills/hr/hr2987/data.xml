  <summary>11/9/1997--Introduced.
Provides an overtime hourly rate of pay of one and one-half times the hourly rate of basic pay and provides that all such pay is premium pay for an employee of the National Weather Service who occupies a nonmanagerial position in GS-14 or under: (1) the duties of which are essential to the immediate daily operation of the forecast and warning responsibilities of the Service and directly affect public and aviation safety; (2) in which overtime work is usually unscheduled due to the vicissitudes of severe weather; and (3) in which overtime work is therefore unusually taxing. Exempts such an employee from the limitation on aggregate pay, including premium pay, for a pay period.</summary>
