    "text": "National Parks Air Tour Management Act of 1998 - Amends Federal aviation law to prohibit a commercial air tour operator from conducting commercial air tour operations over a national park or tribal lands, except in accordance with this Act, conditions prescribed for that operator by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and with any applicable commercial air tour management plan for the park or tribal lands. (Sec. 3) Sets forth specified requirements with respect to: (1) the granting of authority to commercial air tour operators to conduct air tour operations over national parks or tribal lands, with specified exceptions; (2) establishment of commercial air tour management plans; and (3) determination of whether a flight is a commercial air tour operation. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator of the FAA and the Director of the National Park Service (Director) to establish, jointly, an advisory group to provide continuing advice and counsel with respect to the operation of commercial air tours over and near national parks. (Sec. 5) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to report to the Congress on the effects proposed overflight fees are likely to have on the commercial air tour industry. Directs the Administrator of the FAA and the Director to report jointly to the Congress on the effectiveness of this Act in providing incentives for the development and use of quiet aircraft technology. (Sec. 6) Exempts any unit of the National Park System, or any other land or water, located in Alaska from the requirements of this Act."
