Maintains: (1) Federal rights to oil and gas reserves; and (2) existing land use leases, easements, rights-of-way, and special use permits. Releases future owners from all liability from any environmental law, statute, and regulatory violations or contamination problems arising from any action or inaction of previous tenants that had vacated their lease prior to conveyance of said lands. Provides that such property shall revert to the United States if the Secretary determines that the lands are not being used in accordance with this Act during the five-year period after such conveyance."
