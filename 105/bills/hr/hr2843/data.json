    "text": "Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1998 - Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to reevaluate regulations regarding: (1) the equipment required to be carried in medical kits of aircraft operated by air carriers; and (2) the training required of flight attendants in the use of such equipment. Requires the Administrator to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to make any modifications to such regulations as a result of such reevaluation. Requires major air carriers to make a good faith effort to report quarterly to the Administrator, over the course of a year, regarding deaths on aircrafts. Requires the Administrator to decide whether or not to require automatic external defibrillators on passenger aircraft and at airports. Prohibits the Administrator from requiring them on helicopters and on aircraft with a maximum payload capacity of 7,500 pounds or less. States that, if the Administrator decides that automatic external defibrillators should be required at airports, the proposed rulemaking or recommendation shall provide that the airports are responsible for providing the defibrillators. Declares that an air carrier shall not be liable for damages in any action brought in a Federal or State court arising out of the carrier's performance in obtaining or attempting to obtain the assistance of a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, or out of the passenger's acts or omissions while rendering such assistance, if the passenger is not an employee or agent of the carrier and the carrier in good faith believes that the passenger is medically qualified. Declares that an individual shall not be liable for damages in any such action arising out of acts or omissions in providing or attempting to provide such assistance, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct."
