Directs the Secretary of the Army to complete the on-going habitat needs assessment conducted under the Act not later than September 30, 2000, and to include in each six-year report the most recent habitat needs assessment conducted. Permits not more than 80 percent of the non-Federal share of first costs for activities to enhance fish and wildlife resources to be satisfied through in-kind contributions, including facilities, supplies, and services that are necessary to carry out the enhancement project."
