Workplace Leave Fairness Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide that the length of an employee's leave of absence (even if it is only part of one day), and any reductions in pay or accrued leave of any type to which the employee is therefore subject, shall not disqualify that employee for the exemption from minimum wage and maximum hours (overtime) requirements.</summary>
