  <summary>8/6/1998--Introduced.
Telecommunications Trust Act of 1998 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to state that contributions currently required of providers of interstate telecommunications services for the preservation and enhancement of universal telecommunications services shall no longer be required after the date on which appropriated funds are first available for Federal universal service support. Authorizes the Federal Communications Commission to continue to distribute balances of such contributions that remain available on such date. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2004 from the Telecommunications Trust Fund (established under this Act) to provide Federal universal service support, such funds to be the exclusive source of funding for such support. Allow such funds to be available on a school year basis in lieu of a fiscal year basis. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish the Telecommunications Trust Fund for the deposit of amounts appropriated for universal services support. Transfers to such Fund 100 percent of amounts received in the Treasury after December 31, 1998, as certain communications excise taxes. Makes Fund amounts available only to provide for Federal universal service support mechanisms.</summary>
