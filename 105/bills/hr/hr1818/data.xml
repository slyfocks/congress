Requires such plans to provide that not less than 75 percent of the funds available to the State be used for specified purposes, including: (1) programs that assist in holding juveniles accountable for their actions; (2) expanded use of probation officers; (3) boot camps for juvenile offenders; (4) other activities (such as court-appointed special advocates) that the State determines will hold juveniles accountable for their acts and decrease juvenile involvement in delinquent activities; (5) establishing policies and systems to incorporate relevant child protective services records into juvenile justice records for purposes of establishing treatment plans for juvenile offenders; (6) a system of records equivalent to the records that would be kept for adults relating to any adjudication of juveniles under 18 years of age as delinquent for conduct that would constitute a violent crime if committed by an adult; (7) programs that utilize multidisciplinary interagency case management and information sharing that enable the juvenile justice and law enforcement agencies, schools, and social service agencies to make more informed decisions regarding early identification, control, supervision, and treatment of juveniles who repeatedly commit violent or serious delinquent acts; and (8) programs designed to prevent and reduce hate crimes committed by juveniles. Revises State plan requirements regarding limits on the placement of juveniles in secure detention or correctional facilities, juvenile contact with adults incarcerated or awaiting trial on criminal charges, and juvenile detention or confinement in adult jails and lockups.

Modifies State plan requirements to: (1) allow juveniles to be housed in adult facilities for up to 48 (currently, 24) hours before their initial court appearance; and (2) require States to implement systems to ensure that public child welfare records relating to a juvenile before a court in the juvenile justice system that are on file in the geographical area under the court's jurisdiction will be made known to such court.
