    "text": "Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Act) to waive immunity of the United States with respect to Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, administrative authorities, sanctions, and penalties concerning water pollution control. Absolves Federal employees of personal liability for civil penalties under water pollution control laws for acts or omissions within the scope of official duties. Makes Federal employees subject to criminal sanctions under Federal or State water pollution control laws, but prohibits applying criminal sanctions to Federal agencies. Permits the imposition of civil penalties or the issuance of compliance orders against Federal agencies determined to be in violation of specified water pollution control or permit requirements. Authorizes the suspension or revocation of permits. Permits the issuance of emergency administrative orders to, and penalties against, Federal agencies. Prohibits an administrative action commenced by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Secretary of the Army for violations by Federal facilities from precluding a civil enforcement action for the same violations. Permits citizen civil actions against Federal agencies alleged to have violated orders issued by the Administrator or the Secretary or that fail to pay a penalty within one year of the effective date of a final order. Includes Federal agencies within the definition of \"person\" for purposes of the Act."
