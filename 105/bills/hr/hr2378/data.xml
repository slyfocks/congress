(On January 6, 1998, the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia approved an agreement between the National Treasury Employees Union and the Justice Department to invalidate the President's cancellation of, and thus reinstate, section 642 of H.R. 2378. Sec. 642, the Federal Employees' Retirement System Open Enrollment Act of 1997, authorizes individuals employed by the Federal Government as of January 1, 1998, who are subject to the Civil Serviced Retirement System (CSRS), to elect to become subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) during 1998.)
