Repeals Federal law providing for the exchange of Federal lands in Utah in exchange for State lands and providing additional lands within Utah for the Goshute Indian Reservation, with the exception of provisions regarding: (1) payment to Utah of a portion of a royalty payment received by the United States for certain mining and mineral interests in Utah; (2) the limit on such payment; and (3) payment in lieu of taxes for certain entitlement lands in Utah. Requires a $50 million payment to Utah upon completion of all conveyances described in the Agreement.</summary>
