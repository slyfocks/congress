Directs the Secretary of the Navy to carry out a pilot program to: (1) gather data on the cost of scrapping U.S. vessels at U.S. locations; and (2) demonstrate cost effective technologies and techniques to scrap such vessels in a manner that is protective of worker safety and health and the environment. Requires the Secretary of the Navy, in selecting a contractor for any contract under the pilot program for the scrapping of a vessel, to award the contract to an offeror that will provide the best value to the United States."
