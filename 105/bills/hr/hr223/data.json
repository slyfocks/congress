Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the amount of Federal payments for a party's nominating convention for the following general election if the party's nominee for President or Vice President does not certify to the Presidential Debate Commission that the nominee will participate in all applicable Commission debates (other than a preliminary debate)."
