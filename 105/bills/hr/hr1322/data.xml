Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment Implementation Act of 1997 - Grants each victim of a Federal felony offense or any other Federal crime of violence the right: (1) to notice of, and not to be excluded from, all public proceedings relating to the offense; (2) to be heard, if present, and to submit a written statement at all public proceedings relating to the offense (and non-public parole proceedings to the extent the convicted offender is afforded such rights) to determine a release from custody, an acceptance of a negotiated plea, or a sentence; (3) to notice of any release or escape from custody relating to the offense; (4) to seek relief from an unreasonable delay of the final disposition of the proceedings relating to the offense; (5) to an order of restitution from the convicted offender pursuant to law; (6) to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any release from custody; (7) to notice of such rights; (8) to be treated with fairness and respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; and (9) to confer with the attorney for the Government. Makes such rights applicable in: (1) Federal (other than military) criminal proceedings, including juvenile justice proceedings; (2) collateral proceedings such as habeas corpus; and (3) similar proceedings in the courts of any district or territory of the United States not within a State. Grants the victim standing in the proceeding to assert the rights established by this Act. Sets forth: (1) remedies for violations; and (2) exceptions and limitations to such rights. (Sec. 4) Directs the courts, and the head of each U.S. department and agency engaged in the detection, investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of crimes to which this Act applies, to designate the persons who will be responsible for identifying the victims, assuring the implementation of the rights provided in this Act, and performing specified services, at each stage of a criminal case. Requires a responsible official, at the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at which it may be done without interfering with an investigation, to identify the victims, inform the victims of their right to receive such services upon request, and inform each victim of the responsible official to whom the victim should address such request. Directs such official to: (1) inform a victim regarding emergency medical and social services, restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled, and counseling, treatment, and other support programs; (2) arrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection; (3) provide notices of specified steps or events during the investigation and prosecution of a crime and after trial; and (4) provide the victim with general information regarding the corrections process. Sets forth: (1) provisions regarding protecting the property of a victim being held, and payment or reimbursement of the cost of a physical examination of the victim, for evidentiary purposes; and (2) remedies for violations of this Act.</summary>
