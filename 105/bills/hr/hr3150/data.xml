TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Consumer Bankruptcy Provisions Subtitle A: Needs Based Bankruptcy Subtitle B: Consumer Bankruptcy Protections Title II: Discouraging Bankruptcy Abuse Title III: General Business Bankruptcy Provisions Title IV: Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions Title V: Municipal Bankruptcy Provisions Title VI: Streamlining The Bankruptcy System Title VIII: Bankruptcy Tax Provisions Title IX: Ancillary and Other Cross-Border Cases Title X: Financial Contract Provisions Title XI: Technical Corrections Title XII: Effective Date; Application of Amendments Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998 - Title I: Consumer Bankruptcy Provisions - Subtitle A: Needs Based Bankruptcy - Amends Federal bankruptcy law to revamp guidelines governing dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 liquidation petition (complete relief in bankruptcy), to one under Chapter 13 (Adjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income). Allows a bankruptcy panel trustee and any party in interest to move for such dismissal or conversion (current law prohibits such party in interest from such motions). Lowers the "substantial abuse" standard for dismissal or conversion to one of simple abuse. Replaces the presumption in favor of granting the relief sought by the debtor with a presumption that abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly income exceeds specified formulae. Provides that the presumption of abuse may be rebutted only with detailed documentation of extraordinary circumstances requiring additional expenses or adjustment of currently monthly total income. (Sec. 102) Requires debtor's counsel to: (1) reimburse the bankruptcy trustee for legal fees in prosecuting a dismissal or conversion motion if the court finds that counsel's filing under chapter 7 was not substantially justified; and (2) pay a civil penalty for the violation of certain bankruptcy rules. (Sec. 103) Revises procedural guidelines to mandate written notice to the individual consumer debtor before commencement of a case that credit counseling services approved by the United States Trustee are available. (Sec. 104) Instructs the Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees to: (1) develop a financial management training curriculum and materials to educate individual debtors on how to better manage their finances; and (2) evaluate and report to the Congress on the curriculum's efficacy. Subtitle B: Consumer Bankruptcy Petitions - Mandates specified notices and disclosures to a debtor by a debt relief counseling agency. (Sec. 107) Sets forth a debtor's bill of rights which such agency must observe. (Sec. 108) Declares invalid any waiver of debtor protections by the assisted person. Prescribes enforcement guidelines. (Sec. 109) Expresses the sense of the Congress that States should develop curricula relating to the subject of personal finance, designed for use in elementary and secondary schools. (Sec. 110) Modifies debt reaffirmation guidelines governing wholly unsecured consumer debts to mandate additional disclosures for dischargeable debt agreements. (Sec. 111) Cites circumstances under which the court may reduce by up to 20 percent a claim based upon unsecured consumer debts if the debtor can show by clear and convincing evidence that the claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment schedule proposed by an approved credit counseling agency acting on the debtor's behalf. (Sec. 112) Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to study and report to the Congress on: (1) whether a consumer engaging in either an open-end or closed-end credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling receives adequate information under Federal law regarding the tax deductibility of interest paid on such transaction; and (2) specifically consider whether additional disclosures are necessary in such transactions where the amount of credit extended exceeds the fair market value of the dwelling. (Sec. 113) Instructs the Board to study and publicize existing protections limiting consumer liability for unauthorized use of a debit card or similar access device. (Sec. 114) Amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to prescribe disclosures regarding initial and annual minimum payments under an open-end credit plan. Instructs the Board to study and report to the Congress on whether consumers have adequate information about borrowing activities which may result in financial problems. (Sec. 115) Amends bankruptcy law to exempt from the property of the bankrupt estate specified postsecondary education accounts placed in a qualified tuition program, or in an education individual retirement account. (Sec. 116) Modifies guidelines governing the discharge of a debtor's liability, as well as the automatic stay, to entitle an individual who is injured by the willful failure of a creditor to credit payments received to bring an action for actual damages and legal fees. (Sec. 118) Modifies exceptions to a discharge in bankruptcy to prohibit discharge of a filing fee imposed by any court upon a prisoner. (Sec. 119) Terminates the automatic stay 30 days after filing of a petition if a chapter 7, 11, or 13 petition was pending and dismissed the previous year, unless the subsequent filing is in good faith. Delineates conditions under which a history of previous petitions in bankruptcy give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the case is not filed in good faith. (Sec. 120) Directs the court to grant relief from the automatic stay upon request of a party in interest with respect to certain real property actions if the court finds that filing the bankruptcy petition was part of a scheme to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors. Denies automatic stay protections regarding certain creditors' enforcement actions against real property for a specified period following a prior order in bankruptcy which forbade the debtor from being a debtor in another bankruptcy case. (Sec. 121) Modifies debtor's duties to mandate specified affirmative actions to be taken by a chapter 7 debtor, including reaffirmation of the debt, or redemption of the property within 45 days, in order to retain possession of personal property. Allows a creditor to take action with respect to such property under nonbankruptcy law if the debtor fails to act within 45 days, unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is consequential value or benefit to the estate. (Sec. 122) Declares that the automatic stay is terminated regarding property of the debtor's estate securing a claim or subject to an unexpired lease, if the debtor fails to complete an intended surrender of consumer debt collateral within a revised, accelerated time frame (unless the court determines upon trustee motion that such property is of consequential value or benefit to the estate). (Sec. 123) Instructs the bankruptcy court to confirm a chapter 13 plan if it provides that the holder of a secured allowed claim shall retain the attendant lien until payment or discharge of all debts. Provides that if a chapter 13 proceeding is dismissed or converted without completion of the plan, the holder shall retain such lien to the extent recognized by applicable nonbankruptcy law. (Sec. 124) Requires that the value of personal property collateral be at least equal to the outstanding balance of the purchase price, including interest and charges, where the property was acquired by the debtor within five years of filing the petition in bankruptcy. (Sec. 125) Declares that, in the case of chapter 7 and chapter 13 debtors, the personal property securing an allowed claim shall be the replacement value as of the date the petition is filed without deduction for costs of sale or marketing. (Sec. 126) Increases from 180 to 730 days the length of a debtor's location of domicile for purposes of determining which State law governs the debtor's selection of property exempt from the bankrupt estate. (Sec. 127) Revises guidelines exempting property from the bankrupt estate to reduce the value of an interest in certain property used as a residence or burial plot to the extent that such value is attributable to any portion of property disposed by the debtor during a specified period with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor and that the debtor could not have exempted had the property been held on the petition filing date. (Sec. 128) Revises circumstances under which enforcement of rights and remedies of a secured party in either rolling stock equipment, or aircraft equipment and vessels, is subject to the automatic stay. (Sec. 129) Revamps Chapter 13 debt discharge guidelines. Prohibits discharge from a debt for restitution or damages awarded in a civil action against the debtor for willful or malicious injury that caused personal injury or death of an individual. (Sec. 130) Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal judicial code to mandate appointments for additional temporary bankruptcy judgeships in California, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia. Provides that the first vacancy occurring in such a district five years or more after a judge is appointed under this Act shall not be filled. Extends temporary bankruptcy judgeship positions authorized for the northern district of Alabama, the eastern district of Tennessee, and the districts of Delaware, Puerto Rico, and South Carolina. Directs each chief bankruptcy judge to report annually to the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts on the travel expenses of each bankruptcy judge assigned to the applicable district. (Sec. 131) Places in the tenth order of prioritized claims against the bankrupt estate any death or personal injury claims resulting from the unlawful operation of a motor vehicle or vessel because the debtor was drug or alcohol-impaired. (Sec. 133) Revises requirements governing a stay of action against a chapter 13 codebtor who did not receive the consideration for a claim to provide a maximum 30-day automatic stay to the extent that the creditor proceeds against: (1) the individual that received the consideration; or (2) the property not in the possession of the debtor that secures that claim. States that such stay shall apply in any case in which the debtor is primarily obligated to pay under a legally binding separation or property settlement agreement or divorce or dissolution decree. (Sec. 134) Denies a debtor an automatic stay of the commencement of an investigation or action by a securities self-regulatory organization to enforce compliance with its regulations, or of the enforcement of any order or decision obtained by such an organization, other than for monetary sanctions.
