Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997 - Amends the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act to replace the existing Act with provisions requiring a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the coastal waters of a State that the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior determine is not complying with the Commission's plan for managing Atlantic striped bass. Provides for civil penalties and forfeiture of vessels, gear, and fish for violations of the moratorium. Mandates continuing, comprehensive studies of Atlantic striped bass stocks and a study of the socio-economic benefits of the Atlantic striped bass resource. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act. Authorizes cooperative agreements between the Secretaries and the Commission or States to use amounts appropriated under the Act. Requires the Commission to prepare such management plans in accordance with standards and procedures of the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act relating to the preparation of coastal fishery management plans. Mandates regulations governing fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the Exclusive Economic Zone that are consistent with the national standards in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, ensure the effectiveness of State regulations on fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the coastal waters of a coastal State, and meet other requirements. Applies provisions of that Act regarding prohibited acts, civil penalties, criminal offenses, civil forfeitures, and enforcement concerning regulations and any plan issued under this paragraph. Repeals provisions of the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act relating to studies of the anadromous stocks of Atlantic striped bass. Repeals provisions of Federal law relating to a study of the striped bass fishery resources and habitats of the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River basin area. Repeals provisions of Federal law relating to regulations governing the fishing for Atlantic striped bass in the Exclusive Economic Zone.</summary>
