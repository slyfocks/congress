    "text": "Expanding International Education for All Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to revise title VI (International Education). (Sec. 2) Revises part A (International and Foreign Language Studies) with respect to incentive grants for the creation of undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs. Allows graduate schools, along with baccalaureate degree granting institutions and community and junior colleges of higher education, to be included as part of a consortium that serves undergraduates and is eligible for a grant. Revises the Federal and non-Federal shares of the cost of planning and establishing at the undergraduate level: (1) a foreign language program; (2) an international studies program; or (3) (new in this Act) a business and international education program. Revises allowable uses of grant funds to include: (1) acquisition of research and instructional materials; (2) establishment of a network with other institutions of higher education and resource centers focused on strengthening foreign language study and international studies programs; (3) development of new opportunities for learning foreign languages, including the less commonly taught languages; (4) international education programs designed to develop or enhance linkages between two- to four-year institutions of higher education, or baccalaureate and postbaccalaureate programs or institutions; (5) in-service and faculty development activities designed to strengthen instruction and research capacity of the institution; and (6) faculty travel in foreign areas, regions, and countries. Establishes certain grant conditions. Establishes, under part A, a program of discretionary grants for technological innovation and cooperation for foreign information access. (Replaces the current discretionary grants program for acquisition of and access to periodicals and other research materials published outside the United States.) (Sec. 3) Revises part C (Institute for International Public Policy) with respect to the non-Federal share and source of funds for minority foreign service professional development. Directs the Institute to make institutional development grants to strengthen international affairs programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, Tribally Controlled Indian Community Colleges, and minority institutions. (Sec. 4) Revises the Institute's share of the cost of the junior year program. Authorizes the Institute to carry out a summer abroad program. (Sec. 5) Directs the Institute to enter into agreements with specified types of institutions of higher education to conduct postbaccalaureate internships in Washington, D.C., with work experience to assist the students to prepare for a Master's degree program. Requires such internship program to be carried out with the assistance of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Program. (Sec. 6) Establishes in the executive branch an Interagency Committee on Minority Careers in International Affairs to: (1) advise the Secretary and the Institute on part C programs; and (2) promote policies in furtherance of part C objectives in each participating department and agency. (Sec. 7) Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for part C."
