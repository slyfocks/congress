Allows designated smoking areas if: (1) the area is ventilated in accordance with certain specifications; (2) nonsmoking individuals do not have to enter the area for any purpose; and (3) children under 15 are prohibited from entering. Allows an action to enforce this Act by any aggrieved person, any State or local government agency, or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Allows injunctions and civil monetary penalties, but prohibits the award of damages of any kind. Defines \"public facility\" as any building regularly entered by ten or more individuals at least one day per week, except for any building or portion thereof regularly used for residential purposes. Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit smoking in an aircraft in scheduled interstate, intrastate, or foreign flights."
