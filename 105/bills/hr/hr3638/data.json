Directs the Secretary of Transportation to make grants to States to assist State agencies, local governmental authorities, and nonprofit organizations in financing transportation services designed to transport TANF recipients to and from jobs and activities related to their employment. Authorizes appropriations. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide loan guarantees to States with respect to State loans taken out by TANF recipients in a principal amount of between $20 and $5,000, and bearing a certain annual interest rate."
