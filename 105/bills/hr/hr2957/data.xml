  <summary>11/8/1997--Introduced.
Helicopter Noise Control and Safety Act - Requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration upon determining independently, or after review of a study submitted by a requester, that helicopter operations pose a public noise and safety risk in a county or municipality with a greater than 500,000 population, to develop and implement a plan, in accordance with specified requirements, to reduce that risk. Authorizes any city, State, local government, agency, or instrumentality, or any person responsible for the operation of a heliport, to submit to the Administrator: (1) a study demonstrating that noise or safety conditions, or both, resulting from helicopter operations pose a risk to the public health and welfare of such a county or municipality; and (2) a plan to reduce the risk. Requires the Administrator to review such a plan and, upon determining that helicopter operations pose such a risk, to make any modifications necessary to conform with this Act. Specifies procedures for public comment and implementation of a plan developed in either manner.</summary>
