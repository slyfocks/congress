  <summary>10/10/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to establish guidelines for the transfer to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and deposit into a special account of any contribution or donation given to a political committee that the committee intends to return, as well as for the return of such contribution or donation after it is deposited to the person who made it. Requires: (1) the political committee to include certain information along with the transferred contribution or donation, such as a request that the FEC return the contribution or donation to the person making it; and (2) the FEC to notify the Attorney General and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service of the receipt of such contribution or donation. Allows amounts in the special account to be applied toward the payment of any applicable fines or penalties.</summary>
