  <summary>6/19/1997--Introduced.
Special Government Employee Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal criminal code to include within the definition of "special Government employee" a reserve officer of the armed forces, or a National Guard officer, who is serving voluntarily for up to 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days. (Such officers are currently considered officers of the United States.) States that "officer and employee" and "special Government employee" shall not include enlisted military personnel or an individual retained, designated, or appointed without compensation specifically to act as a representative of a non-Federal interest on an advisory committee.</summary>
