    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Prevention of Spamming Title II: Prevention of Slamming and Cramming Digital Jamming Act of 1998 - Title I: Prevention of Spamming - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require each electronic mail (e-mail) service provider, under regulations prescribed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to inform its subscribers of the opportunity to provide notification of the subscriber's objection to receiving unsolicited commercial e-mail messages (spam messages). Requires such regulations to specify the methods by which each e-mail service subscriber shall be informed by the service provider of: (1) the subscriber's right to give or revoke an objection to receiving spam messages; and (2) the manner in which such right may be exercised. Makes it unlawful for any person to initiate spam messages: (1) unless such a message contains specified information identifying the sender, a means to indicate a desire not to receive such messages, and related information; (2) to any recipients who have previously indicated a desire not to receive such messages; or (3) unless such a message contains Internet routing information that is accurate, valid, and correctly reflects the actual message routing. Prohibits a subscriber from using the provider's e-mail service in violation of that service's published policy prohibiting or restricting the use its service or equipment for the initiation of a spam message. Provides subscriber liability for violations. Title II: Prevention of Slamming and Cramming - Provides that a telecommunications carrier that violates the verification procedures required before recognition of a switch in a subscriber's telephone or toll service provider shall be liable to such subscriber for twice the amount of all charges paid by the subscriber after such violation. Prohibits such a carrier from submitting for billing on telecommunications services bills unauthorized services or products (cramming). Provides carrier liability for violations. Authorizes the attorney general of a State to bring a civil action on behalf of its residents for such violations. Requires a State so acting to previously notify the FCC and provide a copy of its complaint. Directs the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the Department of Commerce to conduct a study of, and report to specified congressional committees concerning, the feasibility and desirability of establishing third party verification and authentication systems for preventing illegal changes in telephone subscriber carrier selections."
