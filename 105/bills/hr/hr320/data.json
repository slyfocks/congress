    "text": "Chinese Slave Labor Act - Prohibits the importation of Chinese products unless: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury determines that they are not grown or manufactured with the use of forced labor; and (2) such determination is based on consultations with certain international organizations conducting inspections and an importer's certification to the Secretary that a product was not grown or manufactured with the use of forced labor. Requires the United States to use all diplomatic efforts to persuade China to permit representatives of such international organizations to inspect all facilities holding detainees to assure that products for export are not being produced with the use of forced labor. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of such prohibition and the making of a false certification."
