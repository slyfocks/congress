  <summary>1/21/1997--Introduced.
Native American Telecommunications Act of 1997 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to initiate a proceeding to develop and establish an official policy regarding the relations between FCC and American Indians (including Alaskan Natives). Requires the policy to include procedures for giving Native Americans notice and the opportunity for meaningful participation and comment in any proceedings affecting tribal lands, including competitive bidding conducted for bands of frequencies in areas under the jurisdiction of tribal governments. Requires a review and revision as necessary of such policies at least every three years. Requires the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC to include access by Native Americans as a principal for the preservation and advancement of universal service. Requires the FCC to: (1) prescribe regulations necessary to obtain reliable statistics concerning the extent of subscribership to, and the affordability of, telecommunications and information services on Indian lands; (2) periodically review and summarize such data in its annual reports; and (3) take necessary actions to deliver telecommunications and information services to Native Americans at just, reasonable, and affordable rates. Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to make the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration responsible for designing and proposing policy initiatives to encourage investment in, and the deployment of, telecommunications systems on Indian lands.</summary>
