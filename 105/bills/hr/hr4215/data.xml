Instructs the Secretary of Energy to prepare for mandatory inclusion in the President's budget request for FY 2000 a plan and proposed legislation to ensure that all amounts accrued on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used to commence construction, by January 31, 2004, and operate an onsite facility at each of the gaseous diffusion plants at Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, to treat and recycle depleted uranium hexafluoride. Prohibits the withdrawal of such amounts from either the USEC Fund or the Working Capital Account until one year after the date on which the President submits the FY 2000 budget request to the Congress.</summary>
