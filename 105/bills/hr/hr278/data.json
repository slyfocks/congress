(Sec. 106) Modifies speedy trial provisions to provide that if a juvenile proceeded against under provisions regarding delinquency proceedings or criminal prosecutions in district courts who is in detention pending trial is not brought to trial within 45 (currently 30) days, the information shall be dismissed on motion of the alleged delinquent or at the direction of the court. (Sec. 107) Requires: (1) the court to hold a disposition hearing within 40 court days after finding a juvenile to be a juvenile delinquent, unless the court has ordered further study; and (2) victim impact information to be included in the predisposition report and victims to be provided the opportunity to make a statement to the court or present information regarding disposition. Requires the court to order restitution. Authorizes the court to suspend the findings of juvenile delinquency, place the juvenile on probation, commit the juvenile to official detention, and impose any fine that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult. Sets forth or modifies provisions regarding: (1) limits on detention, supervised release, and commitment of juveniles; (2) an inpatient study; (3) juvenile records; and (4) serious juvenile delinquency drug trafficking adjudications as predicates to the Armed Career Criminal Act.
