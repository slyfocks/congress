    "text": "Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997 - Directs the Attorney General (AG) to designate an association of employers of private security officers, which must submit to the AG, at the request of an employer of officers, fingerprints or other methods of positive identification for background checks of such officers. Allows an employer to seek authorization from its employees for a background check. Directs the AG, upon receipt of fingerprints from an association, to: (1) search records of the Interstate Information Index of the National Crime Information Center and the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and (2) provide any corresponding identification and criminal history records to the requesting association. Authorizes the AG to prescribe regulations to carry out this Act, including measures relating to the imposition of fees necessary for the recovery of costs. Directs the AG to report to specified congressional committees two years after enactment of this Act on the number of inquiries made by the association of employers and their disposition. Establishes criminal penalties for misuse of such background check information. Provides that employers shall not be held liable in any action for damages based on employment determinations that rely on such criminal history information from the AG. Authorizes the AG to collect a user fee for a request, under any applicable law, for an individual's criminal history information."
