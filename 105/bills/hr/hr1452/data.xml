  <summary>4/24/1997--Introduced.
Kinship Care Act of 1997 - Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to authorize States to conduct demonstration projects to determine whether it is feasible to establish kinship care as an alternative to foster care for a child who has been removed from home and would otherwise be placed in foster care, but has adult relatives willing to provide safe and appropriate care for the child. Requires the State to: (1) provide the adult relative caregiver for a child with notice of, and an opportunity to be heard in, any dispositional hearing or administrative review held with respect to the child; and (2) give preference to that relative caregiver over a non-related caregiver when determining a placement for a child, provided that the relative caregiver meets all relevant State child protection standards, and that placement with the relative caregiver would be consistent with the child's safety needs.</summary>
