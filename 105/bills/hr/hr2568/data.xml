TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Alternative Fuels--General Title II: Alternatives Fuels--Non-Federal Programs Title III: Availability and Use of Replacement Fuels, Alternative Fuels, and Alternative Private Vehicles Energy Policy Act Amendments of 1997 - Title I: Alternative Fuels--General - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to: (1) include biodiesel fuels as alternative fuels; (2) modify definitions relating to heavy duty motor vehicles and marine vessels; and (3) include among replacement fuels those fuels derived from biodiesel. (Sec. 102) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide that, if alternative-fueled light duty Federal vehicles are not acquired from original equipment manufacturers, existing fleet vehicles may be converted to alternative fuel-use if the original manufacturer's warranty continues to apply to such vehicles. (Sec. 103) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to prescribe compliance guidelines governing the conversion of Federal fleet vehicles into alternative-fueled vehicles. Title II: Alternative Fuels -- Non-Federal Programs - Requires State and local incentives programs to include the goal of introducing substantial numbers of light and heavy duty alternative fuels vehicles and increasing the use of alternative fuels. Conditions State eligibility for Federal assistance upon inclusion in each State plan of an examination of the introduction of converted or acquired light and heavy duty alternative-fueled vehicles in State-owned or operated motor vehicle fleets. (Sec. 201) Authorizes the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) to provide, upon State request, Federal financial assistance grants for the incremental purchase cost of alternative fuels. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the President and the Congress on the volume of alternative fuel likely to be consumed. (Sec. 202) Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to provide financial assistance to States and political subdivisions for the incremental cost of alternative-fuels used in dual fueled school buses, and the conversions of such buses to alternative-fueled vehicles. (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to conduct studies regarding the use of alternative fuels in nonroad vehicles, including marine vessels. Title III: Availability and Use of Replacement Fuels, Alternative Fuels, and Alternative Fueled Vehicles - Modifies the deadline for the Secretary to evaluate whether program goals have been achieved with respect to the replacement fuel supply and demand program. (Sec. 302) Modifies credit allocation guidelines governing alternative-fueled vehicle acquisitions to deem certain acquisitions (conversions of existing vehicles) as alternative compliance credits. (Sec. 303) Directs the Secretary to submit to the Congress recommendations for requirements or incentives for: (1) suppliers of alternative-fueled vehicles to make such vehicles available to the public through conversion and warranty; and (2) exempting replacement fuels from taxes levied on nonreplacement fuels if the Secretary notifies the Congress that a fleet requirement program is not necessary.</summary>
