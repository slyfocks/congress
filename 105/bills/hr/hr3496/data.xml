  <summary>3/18/1998--Introduced.
Information Technology Partnership Act - Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), subject to appropriations, to carry out a demonstration project under which grants are awarded to five eligible local educational agencies (LEAs) for: (1) developing information technology programs that build or expand mathematics, science, and information technology curricula; (2) purchasing equipment necessary to establish such programs; and (3) providing teacher training in such fields. Makes eligible for grants LEAs that: (1) are located in cities that have received an award from the NSF under the Urban Systemic Initiative program; (2) have provided assurances that they have executed conditional agreements with representatives of the private sector to provide services and scholarship funds; and (3) agree to enter into an agreement with the Director to comply with this Act. Sets forth application requirements. Requires the Director to give special priority for grants to LEAs that demonstrate the greatest ability to obtain commitments from the private sector for services and funds. Requires the Director to: (1) assess the effectiveness of activities under this Act; and (2) initiate a longitudinal study of students selected for scholarships and report findings to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations. Limits the maximum grant awarded to an LEA.</summary>
