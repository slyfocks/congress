    "text": "Transported Air Pollution Mitigation Act of 1997 - Amends Clean Air Act provisions regarding State implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards to require a State, for each upwind area which causes or significantly contributes to a violation of the ambient air quality standard for ozone in a downwind area, to submit a plan revision that requires the upwind area to either: (1) reduce emissions of ozone or its precursors by an amount necessary to mitigate impacts to pollution concentrations in the downwind area commensurate with the level of contribution caused; or (2) make payments to the State or the air quality district as compensation to the downwind area for the costs of emission reduction measures to fully mitigate the impacts of transported pollutants. Directs States which cause or significantly contribute to violations of such standards (upwind States) in another State (downwind area) to revise plan provisions for interstate pollution abatement to meet the requirements described above. Requires a State, for each Moderate ozone nonattainment area determined to cause or significantly contribute to a violation of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone in a downwind area or State, to submit a plan revision including all provisions necessary for an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program described in provisions concerning Serious areas and Environmental Protection Agency regulations. Requires amendment by a State of its plan for maintenance (required when a State requests redesignation of a nonattainment area as an area which has attained the national ambient air quality standard) to include measures for such an inspection program if the area concerned is causing or significantly contributing to a violation of such standards for ozone in a downwind area or State. Provides for amendments to maintenance plans in upwind areas and States that cause or significantly contribute to violations of such standards in downwind areas or States to require implementation of all measures contained in the State implementation plan for upwind areas before redesignation as attainment areas. Requires implementation of all control measures necessary to fully mitigate the transport of ozone and its precursors to downwind areas. Prohibits any relaxation or rescission of such measures as long as an upwind area or State contributes to such violations in a downwind area."
