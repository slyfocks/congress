    "text": "School Bus Safety Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe Federal proficiency standards for school bus drivers who are required to possess a commercial driver's license to operate a school bus. Requires the Secretary, in prescribing such standards, to authorize States to establish their own proficiency standards in lieu of the Federal standards if the Secretary determines they are as rigorous as the Federal standards. Requires bus drivers to demonstrate their proficiency in operating a school bus in accordance with either the Federal or State standards. (Sec. 4) Directs the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop and disseminate guidelines on the safe transportation in school buses of children under the age of five. (Sec. 5) Amends Federal transportation law to require the Secretary to issue regulations applying Federal commercial motor carrier safety regulations to all interstate school operations by local educational agencies. Directs the Secretary to develop an education program informing all local educational agencies that they must comply with such regulations when providing interstate transportation on a school bus to and from school-sanctioned and school-related activities. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to begin a rulemaking process to determine the feasibility of certain safety and access requirements for school buses. (Sec. 7) Prohibits a local educational agency, and any contractor providing transportation services to such agency, from employing a person as a school bus driver before the completion of a background check in the national criminal history background check system. Requires State criminal background check procedures to meet the guidelines set forth in the National Child Protection Act of 1993. Declares that no local educational agency or contractor providing it with transportation services shall be liable in an action for damages on the basis of a criminal conviction of a person employed as a school bus driver if a criminal background check was conducted but the conviction was not disclosed. Authorizes State and Federal fees (not exceeding actual cost) for assistance in the conduct of such checks. (Sec. 8) Requires the Secretary to: (1) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to minimum reporting criteria on traffic-related deaths and injuries under State highway safety programs; and (2) issue a final rule establishing such criteria. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to specified congressional committees on the safety issues attendant to transportation of school children to and from school and school-related activities by various transportation modes. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program to assess the benefits of equipping school buses with Aaron Gordon type flight attendant double shoulder harness mechanisms or other safety restraint devices providing equal or greater passenger protection. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to one school district for equipping school buses with such safety restraint devices. (Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations."
