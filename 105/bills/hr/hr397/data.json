Directs the President, for any fiscal year with respect to which the President determines that it is infeasible to submit a budget in compliance with such balanced budget requirement, to submit on the same day two budgets, one of them in compliance with such requirement, together with written reasons in support of that determination. Title II: Amendment to Congressional Budget Act of 1974 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (CBA) to require reporting of balanced budgets by Committees on the Budget of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Requires either such Committee, for any fiscal year with respect to which such Committee determines that it is infeasible to report a concurrent resolution on the budget in compliance with such balanced budget requirement, and includes written reasons in support of that determination in its accompanying report, to report two concurrent resolutions on the budget, one of them in compliance with such requirement. Amends CBA to make it in order, in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, to consider: (1) any amendment to a concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year comprising the text of any budget submitted by the President for that fiscal year in compliance with the balanced budget requirement; and (2) whenever applicable, an amendment comprising the text of any alternative budget submitted by the President when the President determines a balanced budget is infeasible for that fiscal year. Title III: Effective Date - Makes this Act effective for FY 1999. Requires it to be fully reflected in the President's FY 1999 budget."
