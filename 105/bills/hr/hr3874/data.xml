TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: School Lunch and Related Programs Title II: School Breakfast and Related Programs Title III: Commodity Distribution Programs Title IV: Effective Date William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998 - Title I: School Lunch and Related Programs - Amends the National School Lunch Act (NSLA) with respect to direct expenditures for agricultural commodities and other foods to repeal requirements for: (1) interim sources of funds pending supplemental appropriations; and (2) State matching funds for such interim funds and for cash donations in lieu of commodity donations. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to waive, through FY 2003, any regulatory requirement for using weighted averages for nutrient analysis of menu items and foods offered or served as part of a reimbursable meal under the school breakfast or lunch program. Requires all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (lunch program) under NSLA or the School Breakfast Program (breakfast program) under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (CNA), in which meals are prepared on site, to obtain inspections at least once during each school year that indicate food service operations meet State or local health and safety standards. Requires single permanent agreements between State agencies and school food authorities. Requires common claiming procedures under such school food programs. (Sec. 103) Revises special assistance requirements with respect to: (1) initial and extension time periods for school eligibility; and (2) computation of adjustments to payment rates. Directs the Secretary to make grants to not more than ten State agencies to identify, and provide information and technical assistance concerning reimbursement options to, schools most likely to benefit from certain methods of special assistance reimbursement. Provides for funding for such grants. (Sec. 104) Revises requirements for calculating reimbursement rates for school meals. Increases from $10,000 to $25,000 the maximum fine for anyone who embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject of a grant or other form of assistance under CNA or NSLA if such funds, assets, or property are worth $100 or more. Authorizes the Secretary to adjust summer food service program reimbursement rates in non-contiguous States and territories where the cost of providing meals is greater than that in the contiguous States. Directs the Secretary to require that schools in the contiguous United States purchase for the lunch program and breakfast program, whenever possible, only food products produced in the United States. Applies such requirement to Hawaiian schools with respect to domestic commodities or products produced in Hawaii in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of meals under the school breakfast or lunch programs. Allows States, State agencies, schools, or school food authorities to enter into procurement contracts, using funds under NSLA or CNA, with persons that have assisted them in drafting contract specifications. (Sec. 105) Revises the eligibility criteria for private nonprofit institutions under the NSLA summer food service program to increase from five to 25 the number of sites they may operate. Repeals certain summer food service program requirements relating to: (1) a March 1st deadline for indication of interest; (2) restrictions on meal contracting; and (3) vendor registration. Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for the NSLA summer food service program. (Sec. 106) Reauthorizes through FY 2003 the NSLA commodity distribution program, which may use Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and other specified funds to purchase agricultural commodities for use in programs under NSLA, CNA, and the Older Americans Act of 1965. (Sec. 107) Revises NSLA child and adult care food program requirements for licensing and alternate approval for schools and outside school hours child care. Reinstates, and makes permanent, automatic eligibility under the NSLA child care food program for participants in the Even Start program of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Requires State agencies to: (1) perform a site visit to a private institution before approval for participation in the child care food program; and (2) conduct periodic site visits to private institutions determined to have a high probability of program abuse. Revises conditions for child and adult care program participation by institutions moving toward compliance with the requirement for tax- exempt status. Repeals a notification requirement for incomplete applications. Revises requirements relating to use of funds for audits of participating institutions. Repeals specified termination dates to grant permanent authorization to demonstration projects for child care food program qualification of private for-profit organizations providing nonresidential day care services. Directs the Secretary to provide State agencies with increased levels of training and technical assistance for their management and oversight of the child and adult care program. Allows institutions that provide care to at-risk school children during after-school hours, weekends, or holidays during the regular school year to participate in the child care food program. Defines as at-risk any children who are: (1) under age 19 (or children with disabilities at any age); and (2) participate in such a program operated at a site in a geographical area served by a school enrolling elementary students in which at least 50 percent of the total number of children enrolled are certified eligible to receive free or reduced price school meals under NSLA or CNA. Allows such institutions to claim reimbursements, at the free supplement rate, only for: (1) supplements served without charge to at-risk school children during after-school hours, weekends, or holidays during the regular school year; and (2) one supplement per child per day. Directs the Secretary to provide State agencies with information concerning the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) under CNA. Requires State agencies to ensure that each participating child care center (other than institutions providing care to school children outside of school hours) receives certain WIC program informational materials and updates, and provides such information to parents of enrolled children annually. Allows emergency shelter homeless programs to participate in the child and adult care food program. Allows shelters to claim reimbursements, at the free supplement rate, only for: (1) supplements served without charge to resident children through age 12 (or through age 15 if they are children of migrant workers, or at any age if they are children with disabilities); and (2) not more than three meals or two meals and a supplement per child per day. Repeals the current homeless children nutrition program. (Sec. 108) Limits reimbursements for after-school supplements to supplements provided to children in after-school programs organized primarily to provide care with an educational or enrichment component. Raises to age 18 the maximum age for eligibility for such supplements (and provides for no age limit for children with disabilities). Provides for a free supplement to at-risk children in after-school programs operated by schools in low-income areas. (Sec. 109) Repeals authority for certain pilot projects involving: (1) food and nutrition services for homeless pregnant women and homeless mothers or guardians of infants, and the children of such mothers and guardians (boarder babies); (2) meals and supplements outside of school hours; (3) fortified fluid milk; (4) fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, and grain-based products; (5) low-fat dairy products and lean meat and poultry products; and (6) reducing paperwork and application requirements and increasing participation in school breakfast and lunch programs. Directs the Secretary to make grants to State agencies for free breakfast pilot projects in elementary schools under the jurisdiction of not more than six school food authorities in each of the school years 1999 through 2001. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 110) Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for training and technical assistance under the child and adult care food program. Extends authority to fund the food service management institute, including mandatory and discretionary activities. (Sec. 111) Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for compliance and accountability activities under the child and adult care food program. (Sec. 112) Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for the information clearinghouse for nongovernmental groups on food assistance and self-help activities for low-income individuals and communities. (Sec. 113) Replaces current requirements for guidance and grant assistance to eligible entities for accommodating special dietary needs of individuals with disabilities who participate in covered programs under NSLA and CNA. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out accommodation activities, including guidance, technical assistance, training, and grants for State agencies and eligible entities. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2003 for such accommodation activities. Title II: School Breakfast and Related Programs - Amends CNA to eliminate requirements for Federal payment of startup costs of school breakfast programs. (Sec. 202) Repeals specified requirements for reallocation of State administrative expense funds. Eliminates the ten percent limitation on the transfer of administrative expense funds under CNA and NSLA. Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for State administrative expenses under CNA. (Sec. 203) Reauthorizes and revises requirements for the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children (WIC program). Establishes additional program application requirements, involving physical presence and income documentation, for the WIC program. Requires local agencies participating in the WIC program to provide education or educational materials relating to the effects of drug and alcohol use by a pregnant, postpartum, or breastfeeding woman on the developing child. Authorizes the Secretary to provide bulk quantities of WIC program nutrition education materials to State agencies administering the Commodity Supplemental Food Program under the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 at no cost to that program. Allows States to use of funds recovered in claims from vendors and participants to carry out the program in: (1) the fiscal year in which the claim arises; (2) the fiscal year in which the funds are collected; and (3) the fiscal year following that in which the funds are collected. Adds WIC program requirements for: (1) identifying recipients who participate at more than one site; (2) identifying and investigating high-risk vendors; and (3) consideration of price levels of retail stores for program participation. Allows State agencies, beginning in FY 2000, to use specified WIC funds for the purchase of breast pumps. Extends through FY 2003: (1) the authorization of appropriations for the WIC program and for the WIC farmers market nutrition program; and (2) requirements to use certain WIC funds for allocations to State agencies for costs of nutrition services and administration, program infrastructure and information projects of regional or national significance, and breastfeeding promotion and support activities. Revises WIC program requirements relating to: (1) infant formula procurement; (2) level of per-participant expenditure for nutrition services and administration; (3) conversion of amounts for supplemental foods to amounts for nutrition services; (4) use of funds in preceding and subsequent years; (5) farmers market nutrition program matching funds and ranking criteria for State plans; and (6) disqualification of certain vendors convicted of trafficking or illegal sales.
