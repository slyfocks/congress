  <summary>4/29/1998--Introduced.
Multipoint Wiretap Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that certain requirements relating to the specification of the facilities from which, or the place where, a wire or electronic communication is to be intercepted shall not apply if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the actions of the person believed to be committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted could have the effect of thwarting interception from a specified facility (current law requires a showing of a purpose by that person to thwart interception by changing facilities); and (2) the order authorizing or approving the interception is limited to interception only for such time as it is reasonable to presume that the person identified in the application is or was reasonably proximate to the instrument through which such communication will be or was transmitted.</summary>
