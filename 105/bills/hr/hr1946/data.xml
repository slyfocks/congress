Employee Ownership Enhancement Act - Amends the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to require an employer which is closing a plant in connection with the termination of its business to offer its employees an opportunity to buy the business through an employee stock ownership plan. Waives such requirement if the employer orders a plant closing but: (1) will retain the plant assets to continue or begin a business; or (2) intends to continue the business conducted at such plant at another plant.</summary>
