Provides for recapture. Allows any unused portion of a carbonaceous fuels facility credit to be sold or assigned. Provides for the treatment of the seller and acquirer. Excludes from the definitions of \"taxable fuel,\" \"gasoline,\" \"diesel fuel,\" and \"aviation fuel,\" and excludes from taxation under specified provisions, fuel produced by such a facility or that portion of a blend that is such a fuel."
