Requires (currently authorizes) PHAs to disapprove leases that are not reasonable under the section 8 rental voucher program. Makes PHA administrative fee eligibility dependent upon compliance with such provisions. (Sec. 3) Prohibits (with exceptions) a PHA from providing section 8 tenant-based assistance for more than five units owned by any single owner. (Sec. 4) Revises tenant rent and monthly assistance provisions under the certificate and voucher programs."
