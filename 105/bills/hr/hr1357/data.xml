  <summary>4/16/1997--Introduced.
Medicare Subvention Fairness Act - Requires the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS Secretary) to enter into an agreement to carry out a demonstration project under which the HHS Secretary reimburses the Secretary on a capitated basis, from the Medicare Program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, for certain health care services provided by the Secretary to Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries through the TRICARE Program (a managed health care program of the Department of Defense). Outlines project requirements. Requires annual joint reports from the Secretaries to the Congress on the demonstration project. Directs the Comptroller General, at the end of each year in which the project is carried out, to determine and submit to the Congress a report on the extent, if any, to which the costs of the Secretary under the TRICARE Program and the HHS Secretary under the Medicare Program have increased as a result of the project.</summary>
