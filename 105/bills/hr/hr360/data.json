    "text": "Waste Export and Import Prohibition Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit: (1) solid waste exports from the United States to a foreign country not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); and (2) effective January 1, 1999, solid waste exports to or imports from an OECD member country. Specifies exceptions from the first prohibition for certain waste paper, textiles, and glass intended for recycling and not regulated as hazardous waste and an additional exception from the latter for certain scrap metals. Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in the case of an export violation, to: (1) ensure that the exported waste is retrieved (if the recipient country is agreeable to retrieval), either pursuant to a compliance order issued under this Act or by direct retrieval; or (2) dispose of or clean up such waste (to the extent agreed to) if the country is not agreeable to retrieval. Sets forth procedures for issuance of compliance orders. Establishes civil and criminal penalties. Authorizes commencement of citizen lawsuits by foreign governments. Repeals existing prohibitions on the export of hazardous waste."
