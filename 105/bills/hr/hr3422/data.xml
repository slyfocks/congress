  <summary>3/10/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise the methodology used to calculate the drawback (refund of duties) on the export of finished petroleum derivatives that have been manufactured with (substituted for) a qualified article which is of the same kind and quality (whether imported duty-paid or domestic). Redefines the term "qualified article" to include certain manufactured articles (primary forms), including articles of the same kind and quality, or any combination thereof, that are transferred as certified in a certificate of delivery or certificate of manufacture and delivery to an exporter in a quantity not greater than the quantity of articles purchased or exchanged for use in the manufactured article.</summary>
