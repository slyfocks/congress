TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Children and Alcohol Advertising Title II: Higher Education and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Title III: Deductions for Alcohol Advertising or Promotion Title IV: Promotion of Alcoholic Beverages Title V: Alcohol Advertising Title VI: Health Warnings Title VII: Ingredient Labeling for Malt Beverages, Wine, and Distilled Spirits Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse Prevention Act of 1997 - Title I: Children and Alcohol Advertising - Children's Protection from Alcohol Advertising Act of 1996 - Prohibits advertising or promoting alcoholic beverages on any audio tape, audio disc, videotape, video arcade game, computer game, or film. Prohibits outdoor advertising of alcoholic beverages within 1000 feet of any school, playground, or other public facility where individuals under 21 are reasonably expected to convene. Restricts alcohol print advertising in publications with an under-21 readership of 15 percent or more than two million to text only in black and white print. Limits alcohol television broadcast advertising between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. to a picture of the beverage with factual, objective audio information. Mandates criminal fines and allows injunctions. Requires that alcohol manufacturers sponsoring events be identified in the corporate (not brand) name. Prohibits manufacturing or distributing non-beverage products with an identifiable brand of an alcoholic beverage manufacturer (but allows the corporate name). Title II: Higher Education and Alcohol Abuse Prevention - College Campus Alcohol Abuse Prevention and Education Act - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise drug and alcohol abuse prevention program certification requirements (which must be met in order for a higher education institution (institution) to receive any Federal financial assistance) to require such programs to limit alcoholic beverage advertisements in the institution's newspapers and other publications to price and product identification. Prohibits: (1) distribution of any promotional material that encourages the consumption of alcoholic beverages on campus; (2) distribution of free alcoholic beverages for promotional purposes on campus; and (3) sponsorship or public support of any on-campus athletic, musical, cultural, or social program, event, or competition by any alcoholic beverage company or by any group of such companies. Requires that identification, referral, or treatment of students and employees under such programs not jeopardize their matriculation status or employment. Requires specified items under such programs to be developed and adopted with student and employee participation. Directs the Secretary of Education to waive certain sanctions relating to such programs for up to one year in the case of any institution in the process of developing and implementing a required plan. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to institutions or consortia of them, and contracts with such institutions and other organizations, for programs of prevention and education (including treatment-referral) to reduce and eliminate the illegal use of drugs and alcohol and associated violence. Allows such contracts also to be used for a higher education center for alcohol and drug abuse prevention which will provide training, technical assistance, evaluation, dissemination, and associated services and assistance to the higher education community and institutions of higher education. Make a conforming repeal to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Directs the Secretary to make ten National Recognition Awards annually to institutions that have developed and implemented effective alcohol and drug abuse prevention and education programs. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Deductions for Alcohol Advertising or Promotion - Alcohol Promotion and Advertising Tax Fairness Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to disallow a deduction for the expense of advertising (via any means) or promoting any alcoholic beverage. Title IV: Promotion of Alcoholic Beverages - End Taxpayer Promotion of Alcohol Overseas Act - Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to prohibit market access program funds from being used to promote the sale or export of alcoholic beverages. Title V: Alcohol Advertising - Alcohol Advertising Accountability Act of 1996 - Mandates an annual report to the Congress on alcohol advertising, its profile, and its effects, along with recommendations for legislation. Title VI: Health Warnings - Sensible Advertising and Family Education Act - Declares it to be an unlawful or deceptive act under the Federal Trade Commission Act to advertise any alcoholic beverage through magazines, newspapers, brochures, promotional displays, radio, television (including cable, paid per view, or subscription), or other electronic means, unless the advertising includes one of specified health warnings. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain toll-free numbers referred to in some of the warnings. Title VII: Ingredient Labeling for Malt Beverages, Wine, and Distilled Spirits - Truth in Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require malt beverages, wine, and distilled spirits to bear labels: (1) disclosing alcohol content, the number of drinks (defining "drink" as .6 ounces of alcohol by volume), ingredients and calories per container and per drink, and the common name of each ingredient (including additives); and (2) providing a toll-free telephone number (operated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services) for help with a drinking problem.</summary>
