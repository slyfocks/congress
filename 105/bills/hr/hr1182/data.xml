  <summary>3/20/1997--Introduced.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Accountability and Safety Act of 1997 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise provisions concerning the withholding of the U.S. share of assistance for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) projects to apply such limitations to projects in: (1) Cuba; and (2) Burma, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Iran, or the Palestine Liberation Organization, unless the Secretary of State determines it would be contrary to the national security interests of the United States. Makes an exception to the withholding of funds with respect to IAEA programs or projects that provide for the discontinuation or dismantling of nuclear facilities or related materials. Directs the Secretary to instruct the U.S. representative to the IAEA to use the U.S. vote to: (1) oppose IAEA projects at the Juragua Nuclear Power Plant near Cienfuegos, Cuba (including any other IAEA project there that is, or could become, a threat to the security of the United States); (2) seek IAEA reforms to limit membership of its Board of Governors to representatives of member nations that are signatories to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and (3) seek reforms to provide for the availability of IAEA reports to member nations for the purpose of determining the feasibility of and accountability for IAEA projects.</summary>
