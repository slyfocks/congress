    "text": "Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Transfer Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the Carlsbad Irrigation District specified real property within the Carlsbad Project in New Mexico and all U.S. interests in the irrigation and drainage system of the Project and all related lands, including ditch rider houses, the maintenance shop and buildings, and the Pecos River Flume. Requires the conveyed lands to continue to be managed and used for the purposes for which the project was authorized. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Secretary should complete such conveyance within nine months after the enactment of this Act. Requires a report from the Secretary to the Congress if the conveyance is not completed in such time. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide a written identification of all mineral and grazing leases in effect on such lands; and (2) notify all such leaseholders of the conveyance made by this Act. Provides that the District shall assume all U.S. rights and obligations for all mineral and grazing leases, licenses, and permits existing on the conveyed lands and shall be entitled to any associated receipts. Requires receipts paid into the reclamation fund as credits to the Carlsbad Project to be made available to the District for Project purposes. Authorizes the Secretary to expend a specified amount annually from Bureau of Reclamation operation and maintenance funds to implement water conservation practices at the Project. Requires the District to provide matching funds. Indemnifies the United States from damages arising out of any act or omission related to the conveyed property (with an exception for negligence)."
