  <summary>7/11/1997--Introduced.
Screening Mammography Act of 1997 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require that a group health plan (and a health insurance issuer offering group coverage) that provides coverage for diagnostic mammography for any class of participants or beneficiaries also cover annual screening mammography for that class under terms that are not less favorable. Prohibits: (1) denying screening coverage on the basis that it is not medically necessary or not pursuant to a referral or recommendation; (2) denying eligibility, enrollment, or renewal solely to avoid this requirement; (3) providing monetary incentives to participants or beneficiaries to encourage them to accept less; or (4) penalizing or providing incentives to providers. Allows State laws providing at least these protections. (Sec. 3) Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply the requirements of the above paragraph to health coverage in the individual market. (Sec. 4) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit payment for a screening mammography performed more often than annually. (Sec. 5) Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to mandate coverage of annual screening mammographies.</summary>
