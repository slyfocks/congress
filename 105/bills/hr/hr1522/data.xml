  <summary>5/19/1998--Passed House amended.
Amends the National Historic Preservation Act to authorize (current law requires) the Secretary of the Interior to undertake a review of the nomination of a property for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic landmark when an objection to such inclusion has been made. Authorizes the Secretary to administer grants (current law requires the Secretary to administer a program of matching grants-in-aid) to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States. Requires a State or Indian tribe to be solely responsible for determining which professional employees are necessary to carry out its duties relating to the administration of an historic preservation program. Limits Federal properties under the jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol that are exempt from requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act to those properties depicted on a specified map to be kept on file in the office of the Secretary. Extends through FY 2004 funding for the Historic Preservation Fund. Requires Federal agencies: (1) prior to procuring buildings for carrying out agency responsibilities, to use historic properties available to the agency to the maximum extent feasible, especially in central business areas; and (2) when locating Federal facilities, to give first consideration to historic properties in historic districts, then to developed or undeveloped sites within such districts, and finally to historic properties outside of such districts. Requires any rehabilitation or construction undertaken pursuant to such Act to be architecturally compatible with the character of the surrounding historic district or properties. Extends through FY 2004 the budget authority for the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</summary>
