Civil Rights Commission Act of 1998 - Amends the Civil Rights Commission Act of 1983 to extend the termination date of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Authorizes appropriations to carry out that Act. Sets a four-year term of office for the Commission's staff director and requires the Commission to annually review the staff director's performance. Includes the Commission in the term "agency" for purposes of the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Government in the Sunshine Act, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Requires the Commission to prepare an annual financial statement and have the statement audited by an independent external auditor. Shortens Commission Members' terms of office to five years. Requires the Commission to implement the General Accounting Office's recommendations regarding revision of the Commission's Administrative Instructions and structural regulations and to establish a management information system. Requires the Commission to report regarding: (1) enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (2) religious freedom in public schools; (3) the crisis of young African-American males; (4) fair employment law enforcement; and (5) the civil rights implications of regulatory obstacles confronting minority entrepreneurs. Declares that the purpose of advisory committees constituted by the Commission is to conduct fact finding and develop findings or recommendations. Requires any report by an advisory committee to be fairly balanced in the viewpoints represented.</summary>
