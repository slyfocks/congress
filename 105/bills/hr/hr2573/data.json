    "text": "Election Reform in Campaigns Act - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to prohibit House candidates from accepting contributions in an election cycle from persons in excess of the total of contributions accepted from individuals who reside in the State involved. (Sec. 3) Modifies the term \"contribution or expenditure\" (as defined for the purposes of FECA and the Public Utility Holding Company Act) to include contributions and expenditures made to political committees by national banks, corporations, and labor organizations. Prohibits applying current FECA requirements regarding certain permissible political activities by national banks, corporations, and labor organizations to labor organizations unless specified conditions are met. Sets a limitation on communications made by labor organizations to their members and families. (Sec. 4) Eliminates thresholds for the reporting of identification information of certain persons. (Sec. 5) Equalizes the separate individual multicandidate political committees limits on contributions to candidates. (Sec. 6) Indexes the amount of the limitation on aggregate annual annual individual contributions. (Sec. 7) Revises requirements relating to the administrative duties of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to require the FEC to post FECA reports on the Internet within 48 hours of receipt by the FEC."
