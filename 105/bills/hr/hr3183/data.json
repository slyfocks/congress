Requires the individual appointed to be a resident of the State in which the action is pending. Permits any party to the action to petition the court for removal of the master: (1) without cause (but no party may file more than one petition) within ten days after receiving notice of the appointment; and (2) at any time for misfeasance or malfeasance in office, for noncompliance with the residency requirement, or if the master's duties are duplicative of those of an existing official of the political subdivision with respect to which the action was brought. Directs the court, within 21 days after such petition is filed, to hold a hearing for the purpose of ruling on such a petition."
