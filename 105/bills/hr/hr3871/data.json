Revises program requirements for food service management companies to: (1) allow private nonprofit organizations to contract with such companies; (2) make discretionary certain components of State registration and review; and (3) eliminate certain recordkeeping duties of the Secretary of Agriculture with respect to such companies that have been seriously deficient in program participation. Extends through FY 2003 the authorization of appropriations for the summer food service program."
