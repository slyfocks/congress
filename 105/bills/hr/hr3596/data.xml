  <summary>3/30/1998--Introduced.
Learning Differences Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, as many as five institutions of higher education, on a competitive basis, for demonstration projects to develop, test, and disseminate methods, techniques, and procedures for ensuring equal educational opportunity in postsecondary education for individuals with learning disabilities. Requires national geographic distribution of such awards, to the extent feasible, but authorizes giving priority to a historically Black college or university that meets specified eligibility requirements. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
