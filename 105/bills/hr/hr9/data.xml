  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Waives certain foreign assistance and trade and travel prohibitions against Cuba under specified Federal law with regard to certain transactions, including: (1) Cuban nationals who enter the United States on visas to play organized professional baseball; and (2) the return of their baseball earnings to Cuba. Prohibits the President from denying visas to such nationals based upon his or her authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict any entry of aliens or class of aliens that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Declares that this Act shall not be affected by the economic embargo requirements against Cuba under the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996.</summary>
