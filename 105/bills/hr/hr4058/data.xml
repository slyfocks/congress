  <summary>6/16/1998--Introduced.
Amends Federal aviation law to revise aviation insurance requirements with respect to disputed losses to authorize an insured person to bring a civil action in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (currently, only in U.S. district court) against the U.S. Government when: (1) (as currently) an insured loss is in dispute; or (2) the person is subrogated under a contract with the insured party to the insured party's rights against the U.S. Government; and (3) the person has paid to the insured party, with the Secretary of Transportation's approval, a covered amount for a physical damage loss. Extends the Secretary's authority to provide aviation insurance and reinsurance through FY 2003.</summary>
