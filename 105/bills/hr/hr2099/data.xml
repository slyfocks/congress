  <summary>6/26/1997--Introduced.
Requires, notwithstanding any other provision of law, that the Consumer Price Index for Government Use (CPI-G) established under this Act be used to determine the amount of any cost-of-living or similar adjustment under the Internal Revenue Code and any payment listed in this Act that is otherwise subject to an adjustment using a price index that includes prices of tobacco products or distilled spirits or both. Includes in that payment list: (1) Social Security Act benefits; (2) retirement benefits for former U.S. employees or former U.S. armed forces members; (3) payments on account of the death or disability of any current or former U.S. employee; and (4) tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. Requires that the CPI-G be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, but requires it to exclude tobacco product and distilled spirit prices.</summary>
