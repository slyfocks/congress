  <summary>4/30/1997--Introduced.
Prisoners Frivolous Lawsuit Prevention Act of 1997 - Amends rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to provide that by presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying (among other things and subject to specified limitations) that the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support, are made in a case involving a party other than a prisoner, and, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. Directs the court, upon determining in a case involving a party who is a prisoner that provisions regarding improper representations to the court have been violated, to impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties responsible for the violation. Specifies that a sanction imposed for a violation of this rule shall not be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated in a case involving a party who is a prisoner.</summary>
