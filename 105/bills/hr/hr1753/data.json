Redefines the term \"distressed area\" to include an Indian reservation with a population of high risk youth of sufficient size to warrant the establishment of a BGCA. Directs the Attorney General to accept and approve an application for such a grant submitted by BGCA if the application: (1) includes a long-term strategy to establish 1,000 additional clubs and a detailed summary of those areas in which new facilities will be established or existing facilities expanded to serve additional youths during the next fiscal year; (2) includes a plan to ensure that there are a total of not less than 2,500 BGCA facilities in operation before January 1, 2000; (3) certifies that there will be appropriate coordination with those communities where clubs will be located; and (4) explains the manner in which new facilities will operate without additional, direct Federal financial assistance. Earmarks specified funds to provide a grant to BGCA for administrative, travel, and other costs associated with a national role-model speaking tour program."
