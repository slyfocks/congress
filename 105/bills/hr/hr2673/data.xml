Sets penalties for private transfers and transfers by federally licensed firearms dealers and manufacturers. Prohibits and sets penalties for: (1) the manufacture of a handgun in the United States, in or affecting commerce, unless a locking device that meets specified minimum quality standards is attached to, or is an integral part of, the firearm; (2) the transfer by any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of a handgun that is not accompanied by a specified printed message regarding firearm safety and storage; and (3) leaving a loaded firearm, or an unloaded firearm and ammunition, with a minor unless the possession by the minor is supervised by an adult who is not prohibited from possessing a firearm.

Requires: (1) the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a study on the results of this Act and report to the Attorney General and the Secretary; and (2) the Secretary to issue final regulations which prescribe minimum quality standards for locking devices.
