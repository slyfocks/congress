    "date": "1997-04-24", 
    "text": "College Access and Affordability Act of 1997 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to extend and set forth the maximum Federal Pell Grant award for academic year 1998-1999 and each of the four succeeding academic years. Establishes a maximum Pell grant amount of $3,300 for academic year 1998-1999 which is lower than the maximum $4,500 for 1997-1998; and provides for incremental increases until $4,500 is reached as the maximum for academic year 2002-2003. (Sec. 2) Specifies sums that shall be available to the Secretary of Education annually to provide funds for such grants. Authorizes the Secretary, in case of insufficient funds to pay all such grants as specified, to reduce them by either a fixed or variable percentage reduction or by a fixed dollar reduction. (Sec. 3) Provides for forgiveness of student loans for those who do specified types of teaching service for certain periods. (Sec. 4) Makes any institution exempt from the cohort default rate trigger also exempt from administrative action by the Secretary based solely on such institution's cohort default rate under provisions appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations. (Sec. 5) Adjusts specified student aid need analysis formulas. Revises the income protection allowance (IPA) for dependent students and for independent students without dependents (other than a spouse). Permits updating IPA calculations to reflect inflation. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to recall to the Treasury from the reserve funds held by guaranty agencies specified minimum amounts in FY 1998 through 2002. Requires each guaranty agency to transfer all non-recalled reserve funds to a restricted account and invest them in U.S. Government securities specified by the Secretary. Prohibits a guaranty agency (except for FY 1998 operational expenses) from using any restricted account funds without the express permission of the Secretary. (Sec. 7) Provides borrowers under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program with certain extended and graduated repayment options currently available to Direct Loan program borrowers, including the option to change repayment plans. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the repayment plans offered to FFEL borrowers are comparable to Direct Loan repayment plans. (Sec. 8) Reduces the applicable interest rate on all subsidized and unsubsidized FFEL and Direct Loans during in-school, grace, and deferment periods to the same rate as the borrowing rate of the Department of Education, but retains current cap levels on such interest rates. (Sec. 9) Reduces the lenders' insurance rate from 98 to 95 percent.
