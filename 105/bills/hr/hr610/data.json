Sets forth ownership and operating fund reporting requirements. Prohibits a foreign national from participating in the decision-making process of any person's (such as a corporation, labor organization, or political committee) election-related activities. Establishes within the Federal Election Commission a clearinghouse of existing public information regarding the political activities of foreign principals and agents of foreign principals. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, to: (1) revise foreign agents' supplemental reporting requirements; and (2) provide civil penalties for specified reporting violations."
