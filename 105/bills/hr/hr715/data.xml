  <summary>2/12/1997--Introduced.
Accuracy in Campus Crime Reporting Act of 1997 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to revise campus security policy reporting and crime statistics disclosure requirements. Includes other campus officials (as well as campus security or law enforcement, or local law enforcement) among those officials that must report, for statistical disclosure purposes, if specified types of criminal offenses are reported to them. Specifies additions to the list of such offenses. Makes annual submission of campus crime statistics mandatory for all institutions participating in any student aid program under HEA title IV (participating institutions). (Currently such submissions are only required upon the request of the Secretary of Education). Directs the Secretary to report each set of such statistics, clearly identifying each institution and campus, not only to specified congressional committees but also to each participating institution and to the public via printed and electronic means. Requires each official charged with compiling such statistics to certify their accuracy. Repeals a disclaimer that nothing in certain provisions relating to institutional policy on prevention of sexual assaults and procedures after such an assault may be construed to confer a private right of action upon any person to enforce such provisions. Requires any participating institution which maintains a police or security department to keep a daily log of specified crime information open to public inspection. Requires any participating institution to develop and distribute a statement of its disciplinary practices and procedures with respect to crimes, including specified information and policies. Amends the General Education Provisions Act to exclude allegations of criminal activities from the education records subject to family access. Sets forth methods of enforcement of HEA campus security provisions. Directs the Secretary to terminate all assistance to an institution under an applicable program, or issue other specified orders the Secretary deems appropriate to achieve compliance, if any participating institution fails or refuses to comply with requirements for disclosure of campus security policy and campus crime statistics. Prohibits institutional retaliation against individuals for exercising rights or participating in proceedings under such campus security provisions. Requires, under student aid program agreements, that the campus security policies and crime statistics disclosed be comprehensive and accurate.</summary>
