  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund Act of 1997 - Amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new title XXI (Teaching Hospital and Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund), which establishes in the Treasury the Teaching Hospital and Graduate Medical Education Trust Fund for formula payments to teaching hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of operating approved medical residency training programs. Authorizes appropriations. Provides for certain adjustments in Medicare payments under SSA title XVIII, removing medical education and disproportionate share hospital payments from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost. Establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services a National Advisory Council on Postgraduate Medical Education to advise the Secretary on appropriate policies for making postgraduate medical education support payments in order to assure an adequate supply of physicians trained in various specialties, consistent with the health care needs of the United States.</summary>
