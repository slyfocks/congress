  <summary>3/20/1997--Introduced.
Brownfield Cleanup and Redevelopment Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to: (1) establish certification criteria for State programs for voluntary cleanup of eligible facilities; and (2) certify qualified States to carry out cleanup programs at eligible facilities in lieu of any Federal program that addresses the cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Defines "eligible facility," with exceptions, as a facility or property that is a low- or medium-priority environmental hazard for the State but whose environmental contamination is thought to be: (1) preventing the timely use, redevelopment, or reuse of the facility or property; and (2) limited in scope and readily assessable. Requires the Administrator to ensure that State programs continue to meet the terms of certification by meeting annually to discuss the status of the State program and encourage continuing dialogue and by assisting the State in remedying any deficiency. Sets procedures for withdrawal of certification where deficiencies are not resolved. Directs the Administrator to require a State program, to be certified, to provide: (1) that only eligible facilities may participate; (2) adequate opportunities for public participation in the development and implementation of cleanup plans; (3) technical assistance throughout each voluntary cleanup; (4) adequate resources for cleanup and administration of the program; (5) adequate oversight and enforcement authority to ensure that the voluntary cleanups comply with Federal and State laws; and (6) for State certification to the owner or prospective purchaser of an eligible facility that the cleanup is complete. Allows a State to modify any procedural permit applicable to a cleanup conducted under a State program in order to expedite the cleanup. Allows the Administrator, notwithstanding a certification granted under this Act, to: (1) take any action authorized under CERCLA release notification provisions; and (2) carry out investigations, monitoring, surveys, testing, or other information gathering under CERCLA response authorities with respect to facilities subject to a State voluntary response program, but only for purposes of determining qualification for listing on the National Priorities List.</summary>
