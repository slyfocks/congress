    "text": "Judicial District of the Virgin Islands Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a Federal judicial district in the Virgin Islands, composed of two divisions, one for Saint Croix and the other for Saint Thomas and Saint John. Provides two judges for such district. Repeals provisions of the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands regarding judicial divisions, trial by jury, and the U.S. attorney for the Virgin Islands. Vests judicial power of the Virgin Islands in trial or appellate courts established by local law. (Currently, such power is also vested in the District Court of the Virgin Islands.) Requires the local courts of the Virgin Islands to have jurisdiction over all causes of action in the Islands over which any court established by the Constitution and U.S. laws does not have exclusive jurisdiction. (Currently, the Virgin Islands legislature may vest such jurisdiction in such courts.) Replaces references to the District Court of the Virgin Islands in provisions regarding jurisdiction over income tax matters and appellate jurisdiction with references to the U.S. District Court for the District of the Virgin Islands. Removes provisions regarding judges of the District Court of the Virgin Islands. Authorizes the temporary assignment of additional judges to the U.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands. Requires all pleadings and proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Virgin Islands to be conducted in English. Permits pending complaints or proceedings to be pursued to final determination in such court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Supreme Court. Deems references to the District Court of the Virgin Islands in any law to be references to the United States District Court for the Virgin Islands."
