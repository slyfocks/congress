  <summary>5/7/1997--Introduced.
Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to direct the Director of the Office of Foreign Missions to develop records, and to report to the Congress, on each incident in which a diplomat has committed a serious criminal offense within the United States which was not subject to criminal prosecution. Directs the Director to take the necessary steps to: (1) educate local law enforcement officials on the extent of the immunity from criminal prosecution provided to diplomats and their families; and (2) encourage such officials to investigate and prosecute such individuals who commit a serious criminal offense to the extent consistent with their immunity. Prohibits any Department of State officer or employee from interfering with the investigation or prosecution by a State or local government of a diplomat, or a family member of a diplomat, or any other alien not immune from criminal prosecution.</summary>
