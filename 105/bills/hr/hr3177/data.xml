  <summary>2/11/1998--Introduced.
Safe Schools Internet Act of 1998 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit universal telecommunications services from being provided to any elementary or secondary school unless its administrator has certified to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it has selected and installed a system for computers with Internet access which filters or blocks matters deemed inappropriate for minors. Prohibits such service with respect to a library having Internet access unless it certifies that it employs such a filtering or blocking system on one or more of its computers. Requires a library to notify the FCC within ten days after changing or terminating such a system. Requires the determination of what shall be considered inappropriate for minors to be made by the appropriate school, school board, library, or other responsible authority, without Federal interference.</summary>
