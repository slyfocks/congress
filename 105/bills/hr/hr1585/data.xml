  <summary>7/22/1997--Passed House amended.
Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act - Requires the U.S. Postal Service to establish a special rate of postage for first-class mail that is equal to the regular rate plus a differential of not to exceed 25 percent to be offered as an alternative that patrons may use voluntarily to contribute to funding for breast cancer research. Requires the Service to pay 70 percent of the amounts attributable (additional revenues minus costs) to such differential to the National Institutes of Health and the remainder to the Department of Defense under arrangements as mutually agreed, provided payments are made at least twice a year. Requires the Postmaster General to include in each annual report to the Board of Governors information concerning the operation of this Act. Terminates the provisions of this Act at the end of the two-year period beginning on the date on which such postage stamps are first made available to the public. Requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress, no later than three months (but not earlier than six months) before the end of such period, on the operation of this Act.</summary>
