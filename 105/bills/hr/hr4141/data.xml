  <summary>6/25/1998--Introduced.
Provides for an additional map to depict lands added to the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, Georgia, pursuant to this Act. Allows, after July 1, 1999, the Secretary of the Interior to modify the boundaries of the Area to include other lands within 2,000 feet of each bank of the River by submitting a revised map or other boundary description to the Congress. Prohibits such revised boundaries from taking place if the Congress adopts a Joint Resolution disapproving the revision. Permits, before such date, a landowner whose land or portion thereof is within 2,000 feet of each bank of the River, to notify the Secretary that such land is not to be included within the revised boundaries of the Area. Requires the Secretary to modify the boundaries to exclude such land upon receipt of its legal description. Increases the total acreage limitation for the Area to 10,000 (currently, approximately 6,800). Repeals Federal provisions providing for exchange of Federal lands within the Area for non-Federal lands within its boundaries. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with other entities (currently, Georgia and its political subdivisions) to assure standardized acquisition, planning, design, construction, and operation of the Area. Decreases from $79.4 million to $25 million the cap on the authorization of appropriations for acquisition of land and interests in land for the Area. Authorizes the Secretary to accept the donation of funds and lands or interests in lands to carry out this Act. Requires the Secretary, within three years after enactment of this Act, to submit to specified congressional committees a revision of the general management plan for the Area. Prohibits the acquisition of lands and interests in lands under this Act without the owner's consent.</summary>
