Requires schools to give attention to professional development that incorporates technology used to improve teaching and learning. Requires professional development activities to include instruction in the use of technology. Adds technology to the list of core subject areas for the National Teacher Training Project grants program (Dwight D. Eisenhower Professional Development Program). Requires local plans for improving teaching and learning to include descriptions of how their core subject area programs will incorporate technologies which meet the educational needs of individuals who are from historically underrepresented groups, or are economically disadvantaged, or have limited English language abilities, or have disabilities. Requires authorized professional development activities to incorporate effective technology for meeting the educational needs of diverse groups of students. Includes technological innovation as a higher education activity to improve teacher education programs."
