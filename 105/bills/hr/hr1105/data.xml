  <summary>3/18/1997--Introduced.
Women's Pension Equity Act of 1997 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a model: (1) spousal consent form when an election is made to waive a qualified joint and survivor annuity or a qualified preretirement survivor annuity; and (2) qualified domestic relations order. Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to extend the payment of any portion of Tier II Railroad Retirement benefits to surviving former spouses pursuant to divorce agreements. Amends Federal law to provide for a survivor annuity to widows, widowers, and certain former spouses of Federal employees who die after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity, but before attaining the age for such annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System, on the same basis as is currently provided to certain survivors of former Members of Congress. Revises provisions concerning Federal retirement benefits subject to a court order.</summary>
