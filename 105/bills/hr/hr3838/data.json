    "text": "Requires the head of a defense agency, in the evaluation of sealed bids and competitive proposals for a defense contract for the procurement of property or services, to: (1) include as a significant evaluation factor the percentage of work under the contract that the bidder or offeror plans to perform in the United States; and (2) assign a high importance to such factor. Requires such agency head to include in such contracts a clause that the contract will be deemed to have been breached if the contractor performs less work in the United States than originally stated in the bid or proposal. Prohibits the renewal of contracts where the percentage of work completed outside the United States exceeds that stated in the bid or proposal. Allows a waiver of such requirements on a case-by-case basis."
