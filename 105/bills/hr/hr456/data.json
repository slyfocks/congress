Prohibits a railroad carrier from requiring or allowing a commuter rail train employee to operate a split shift unless it begins between 4 o'clock a.m. and 8 o'clock a.m. Prohibits a railroad carrier, and a railroad carrier employee, from discharging or in any way discriminating against an employee (whistleblower) that has furnished railroad accident or injury information to the railroad carrier, the Federal Railroad Administration, or other Federal or State agency. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act."
