  <summary>1/21/1997--Introduced.
Commuter Rail Safety Act of 1997 - Amends Federal transportation law to revise hours of duty limitations for train employees to prohibit them, among other things, from remaining or going on duty: (1) after having completed a tour of duty, unless having had at least eight consecutive hours of undisturbed rest; and (2) unless such employee has received at least eight hours notice before the time for reporting for duty, except in the event of an emergency, in which case the employee may not work for more than eight hours after reporting for duty. Prohibits a railroad carrier from requiring or allowing a commuter rail train employee to operate a split shift unless it begins between 4 o'clock a.m. and 8 o'clock a.m. Prohibits a railroad carrier, and a railroad carrier employee, from discharging or in any way discriminating against an employee (whistleblower) that has furnished railroad accident or injury information to the railroad carrier, the Federal Railroad Administration, or other Federal or State agency. Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act.</summary>
