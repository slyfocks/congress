Allows a limited tax credit to taxpayers holding such public school modernization bonds. Raises the national zone academy bond limitation from $400 million to $1.4 billion for 1999 and 2000, and eliminates the limitation after 2000. Prescribes requirements for national qualified school construction bonds, with a national limitation of $13.7 billion for 1999 and 2000, and no limit after 2000."
