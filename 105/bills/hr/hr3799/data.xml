  <summary>5/6/1998--Introduced.
Drug Free Teenage Drivers Act - Directs the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to establish a demonstration program in the States to provide voluntary drug testing for all teenager applicants (or other first time applicants) for a driver's license. Requires that: (1) information respecting an applicant's choice not to take a drug test and test results be made available to the applicant's automobile insurance company; and (2) if an applicant tests positive, a State shall not issue a license to the applicant and shall require the applicant to complete a State drug treatment program and to not test positive in a drug test before reapplying for a license. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish an incentive grant program to assist the States in improving their laws relating to controlled substances and driving. Requires a State, to receive a grant, to enact, actively enforce, and publicize a law which: (1) makes it illegal to drive in the State with any measurable amount of an illegal controlled substance in the driver's body; and (2) authorizes the suspension of the license of a driver who is convicted of any criminal offense related to drugs. Requires the Secretary to provide technical assistance to the States for: (1) training law enforcement officers in techniques to detect impaired drivers; (2) expanding drug information and training by involving prosecutors in community drug prevention programs; and (3) promoting uniform sanctions for drug offenses, referring drug offenders to assessment and treatment programs, and involving judges in community drug prevention programs.</summary>
