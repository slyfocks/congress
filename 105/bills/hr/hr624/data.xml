  <summary>2/6/1997--Introduced.
Armored Car Reciprocity Amendments of 1997 - Amends the Armored Car Industry Reciprocity Act of 1993 to revise requirements for State reciprocity of weapons licenses for armored car company crew members. Requires such a crew member to have met all requirements to act as an armored car crew member in the State in which such member is primarily employed by the company. Prescribes minimum State requirements for renewal of a weapons license, including continuing training in weapons safety and marksmanship from a qualified instructor for each weapon the crew member is licensed to carry. Limits weapons licenses to two-year periods, except in States which enacted a law before October 1, 1996, providing for a five-year weapons license.</summary>
