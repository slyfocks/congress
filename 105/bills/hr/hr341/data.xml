  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997 - Establishes limitations regarding genetic information disclosure and use. Prohibits disclosure about an individual unless specifically authorized by the individual, or the individual's representative, through a written authorization that includes certain elements. Specifies the circumstances in which disclosure is allowed. (Sec. 5) Prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of genetic tests. Provides for enforcement through the same powers, procedures, and remedies as are provided under specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Sec. 6) Prohibits health insurance discrimination on the basis of genetic tests. Requires, if an insurer requests that an insurance applicant (other than a health insurance applicant) take a genetic test, that: (1) the use of the results of such test be disclosed to the applicant; and (2) the insurer obtain the applicant's specific written authorization for such disclosure. Prohibits an insurer from using such a genetic test as an inducement for the purchase of insurance. (Sec. 7) Directs the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to congressional committees its recommendations on appropriate standards: (1) to provide increased protection for the collection, storage, and use of identifiable DNA samples and genetic information obtained from those samples; and (2) for the acquisition and retention of genetic information in all settings, including appropriate exceptions.</summary>
