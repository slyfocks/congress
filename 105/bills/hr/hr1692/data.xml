  <summary>5/21/1997--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for coverage under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act of extended care services for individuals with a condition classifiable within a select diagnosis-related group (DRG). (Waives the three-day prior hospitalization requirement for coverage of skilled nursing facility services for such DRGs.) Requires the Secretary to select at least five DRGs beginning in FY 1998, and additional qualified groups for subsequent fiscal years. Provides for recovery of excessive expenditures by: (1) reductions in payable amounts for post-hospital extended care services in the following fiscal year; and (2) rescission of the selection of any DRG.</summary>
