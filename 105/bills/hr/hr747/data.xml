Witness Relocation Notification Act of 1997 - Requires: (1) each State or local law enforcement agency that relocates a witness who has been arrested or convicted of a crime of violence, or is otherwise considered by the agency to be a threat to public safety, to provide notice to the chief law enforcement official in the jurisdiction to which the relocation has been made; and (2) the Attorney General to establish guidelines for such notice. Requires: (1) the Director of the National Institute of Justice to survey State and local witness protection and relocation programs to determine the extent, nature, and training needs of such programs and report the results to the Congress; and (2) the Attorney General, based on the survey results, to make available to State and local law enforcement agencies a training program to assist in developing and managing effective, safe witness protection and relocation programs. Makes any agency that fails to comply with the notification requirement ineligible to participate in the training program. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
