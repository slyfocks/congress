Appropriates to the Fund the initial payment under section 102 of this Act and 75 percent of annual assessments under section 102, fines or penalties under section 103, and amounts repaid or recovered under title III. Authorizes appropriations to the Fund as repayable advances. Makes specified percentages of Fund amounts available without further appropriation for carrying out provisions of this Act, for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and for reducing the Federal debt subject to limit. Excludes amounts for the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the debt from consideration for the Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and House Concurrent Resolution 67 of the 104th Congress. (Sec. 102) Requires each tobacco product manufacturer (including repackers, labelers, and relabelers) to make an initial payment to the Fund based on that manufacturer's stock market capitalization as compared to the average stock market capitalization of all manufacturers. Mandates subsequent annual payments by each manufacturer based on that manufacturer's gross domestic tobacco sales during the year. Provides for floor stock treatment. Makes the initial capitalization-based payment and any penalties under title III not tax deductible. Amends the Federal bankruptcy code regarding the priority of unsecured Federal claims for payments, assessments, or penalties to be paid into the Fund. Prohibits manufacturers from using any liability insurance to make payments into the Fund. Mandates regulations regarding placing a Healthy Kids Stamp on each tobacco product package for which an assessment has been paid. Exempts a manufacturer who has consent decrees with more than 25 States before 1998 from the initial payment and certain portions of annual payments. (Sec. 103) Establishes a tobacco manufacturer licensing program. Requires a manufacturer or importer to be licensed to manufacture, distribute, or import tobacco products and to be eligible for protections under subtitle A of title VII. Mandates, for assessment nonpayment, manufacturer and importer license ineligibility and license revocation or suspension. (Sec. 104) Imposes a minimum monetary penalty for noncompliance with section 102. Subtitle B: Payments - Chapter 1: To States - Requires that funds under section 101 be made available to: (1) reimburse each eligible State for State expenditures under title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act for the treatment of individuals with tobacco-related conditions or any other State expenses incurred in providing treatment for tobacco-related conditions; and (2) provide funds to local governments. Requires States, in order to receive the funds, to: (1) agree to resolve any State civil action against a tobacco manufacturer, distributor, or retailer; and (2) submit a plan regarding payments to local governments. Prohibits the Secretary from approving a State plan unless the Secretary makes an explicit written finding that local entities will receive an equitable portion. Chapter 2: Federal Health Programs - Establishes the National Institutes of Health Trust Fund for Health Research (Research Fund), transferring to it amounts made available under section 101. Sets forth the portions of Research Fund amounts to be used for specified purposes. Chapter 3: Investments for Children - Requires use of amounts under section 101: (1) working through the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, to improve child care, early childhood development, school-aged care, parent education and supportive services, health services, and services for children with disabilities; and (2) for grants to State and local educational agencies to train, recruit, and hire elementary school teachers, thus reducing average class size for certain grades. Requires States to ensure that: (1) teachers are qualified; and (2) when qualifications are temporarily waived, unqualified teachers are not disproportionately employed in high poverty schools. (Sec. 133) Amends Medicaid provisions regarding presumptive eligibility for children to include in the definition of "qualified entity" elementary or secondary schools, child care resource and referral agencies, agencies and contractors under title IV, part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of the Social Security Act, Medicaid agencies, certain public housing agencies and contractors, and agencies authorized to determine child eligibility for health assistance under title XXI (Children's Health Insurance) of the Social Security Act. Modifies requirements regarding certain Medicaid expenditures that are counted against individual State allotments. Makes eligible for Medicaid children lawfully present in the United States who would, but for specified provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (relating to a five-year means-tested public benefit waiting period), be eligible under other provisions. Allows a State to include such children in the term "targeted low-income child." Makes the above amendments of this section effective as if they had been included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Authorizes an increase in the Federal medical assistance percentage to reward a State for certain increases in the number of Medicaid-enrolled children. (Sec. 134) Mandates a demonstration project providing for payment under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act of routine patient care costs that are provided to an individual with cancer and enrolled in Medicare as part of the individual's participation in a clinical trial and that are not otherwise eligible for Medicare payment. Requires use of amounts available under section 101 to carry out this section. Title II: FDA Jurisdiction Over Tobacco Products - Deems specified regulations to have been promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) as amended by this title. (Sec. 203) Amends the FDCA to include nicotine in tobacco products in the definition of "drug" and tobacco product delivery components in the definition of "device." Authorizes regulation of any tobacco product as a drug, device, or both. Deems tobacco misbranded if it: (1) states or implies that it presents a reduced health risk unless the product will achieve the best public health result; or (2) violates the FDCA or its regulations. Makes noncompliance with specified provisions added to the FDCA by this Act a prohibited act under the FDCA. Makes provisions preempting State and local requirements inapplicable to tobacco product devices. (Sec. 204) Exempts tobacco products from device Class II special controls if the Secretary of Health and Human Services finds that special controls will achieve the best public health result. Declares that, for the purposes of listed provisions, the safety and effectiveness of a tobacco product device need not be found if the action to be taken under any such provision would achieve the best public health result. Authorizes a tobacco product recall if the best public health result would be achieved. (Sec. 205) Establishes the Scientific Advisory Committee to assist the Secretary, examine the effects of tobacco product nicotine yield level alteration, examine whether there is a nicotine threshold below which dependence is not produced, and review other safety, dependence, or health issues regarding tobacco products. Authorizes the Secretary to adopt a tobacco product performance standard regardless of whether the product has been classified under device classification provisions. Allows the standard to include: (1) reduction or elimination of nicotine; or (2) reduction or elimination of other constituents. Authorizes the Secretary to require that a manufacturer test, report, and disclose tobacco and tobacco smoke constituents, including in labeling and advertising. Requires manufacturers to annually submit: (1) an ingredient list for each brand it manufactures; and (2) a safety assessment for each new ingredient it desires to make a part of the product, with current ingredients receiving a safety assessment within five years after enactment of this Act. Requires that the safety assessment demonstrate that the ingredient will not present any risk to consumers or the public in the intended quantities. Mandates regulations to prohibit any ingredient if: (1) no safety assessment has been submitted as required; or (2) the Secretary finds that safety has not been demonstrated. Requires tobacco product packages to disclose: (1) all ingredients; and (2) the percentages of domestic and foreign tobacco. Authorizes the Secretary to require disclosure of an ingredient that relates to a trade secret if the Secretary determines that the disclosure will promote the public health. Mandates specified warnings and related symbols on cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages and advertising. Preempts related State or local requirements.
