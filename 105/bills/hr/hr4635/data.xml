  <summary>9/25/1998--Introduced.
Authorizes States or political subdivisions to require municipal solid waste generated within their jurisdictions to be managed at a designated facility. Permits authority to be exercised only if the designated facility is in compliance with all applicable Federal and State environmental laws and regulations. Prohibits recovery of damages, costs, or attorney's fees in any claim against a State or local government (including a solid waste management district) based on the exercise of flow control authority authorized by this Act. Defines "flow control authority" as the authority to control the movement of municipal solid waste or voluntarily relinquished recyclable material and to direct such waste or material to a waste management or recyclable material facility. Applies such prohibition to cases commenced before and after this Act's enactment date, except those with respect to which a final judgment no longer subject to judicial review has been rendered.</summary>
