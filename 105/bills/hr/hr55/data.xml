Long Island Sound Preservation and Protection Act - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit the dumping in Long Island Sound or Block Island Sound of dredged material from any Federal or non-Federal project that contains any of the constituents prohibited as other than trace contaminants (as defined by certain Federal ocean dumping criteria set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations), except where it is demonstrated to and certified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that such dumping will not cause significant undesirable effects, including the threat associated with bioaccumulation of such constituents in marine organisms. Requires any dumping of dredged material in Long Island Sound from a Federal project (or pursuant to Federal authorization) by a non-Federal applicant exceeding 25,000 cubic yards to comply with specified criteria under the Act relating the effects of dumping.</summary>
