Small Business Banking Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to authorize any depository institution to permit an owner to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instrument from any interest-bearing or dividend bearing account in order to make payments to third parties (currently such withdrawals are permissible only for specified deposits). Amends the Federal Reserve Act, the Home Owners' Loan Act, and the FDIA to repeal the proscription against the payment of interest on demand deposits. (Sec.3) Amends the Federal Reserve Act to mandate interest payments at least quarterly on balances maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank to satisfy the reserve requirements of a depository institution. Authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to prescribe regulations for such interest payments.</summary>
