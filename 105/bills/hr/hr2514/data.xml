Authorizes the President to present a gold medal, on behalf of the Congress, to the family of the late Raul Julia in recognition of his dedication to ending world hunger and his contributions to the Latino community and to the performing arts. States that no appropriations are authorized to implement this Act, but gifts and donations for the purpose may be accepted. Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund to the Raul Julia Ending Hunger Fund and to the National Hispanic Foundation of the Arts, any proceeds above costs from such gifts and donations as well as sales of duplicate bronze medals.</summary>
