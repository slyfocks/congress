Requires the Secretary of Commerce, in any case in which antidumping duties are imposed upon steel products of a foreign country, to assess such duties on entries made for the period that dumping occurred before the issuance of the order (as well as on entries made after the order), but in no case earlier than one year before an antidumping duty petition was filed or the Secretary initiated an antidumping duty investigation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should respond to complaints filed by U.S. trading partners regarding this prohibition on steel imports by: (1) addressing the failure of those countries' governments to make their companies abide by international trade agreements with respect to dumping; and (2) stating that their failure constitutes a legitimate national security concern to the United States."
