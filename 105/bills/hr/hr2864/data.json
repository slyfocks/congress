Requires States, under such agreements, to: (1) provide on-site consultation upon employer request; and (2) ensure that such on-site consultations provide for employee participation. Authorizes States to provide other education and training programs for employers and employees. Requires such program activities to be conducted independently of enforcement activities. Directs the Secretary to establish rules under which employers may be exempted from certain inspections if they: (1) request and undergo on-site consultative visits and correct identified hazards; (2) agree to request subsequent visits if there are major changes in working conditions or processes which introduce new hazards; and (3) implement procedures for regularly identifying and preventing hazards, and maintain appropriate involvement of and training for managers and non-management employees in achieving safe and healthful working conditions. Requires States to provide such worksite consultations at the employer's request, giving scheduling priority to small businesses in high hazard industries or with the most hazardous conditions at issue."
