  <summary>6/5/1998--Introduced.
Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit grants for public safety and community policing to be used to establish school-based partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and local school systems by using school resource officers who operate in and around elementary and secondary schools to combat school-related crime and disorder problems, gangs, and drug activities. Defines "school resource officer" to mean a career law enforcement officer, with sworn authority, deployed in community-oriented policing, assigned by the employing police department or agency to work in collaboration with schools and community-based organizations to: (1) address crime and disorder problems, gangs, and drug activities affecting or occurring in or around an elementary or secondary school; (2) develop or expand crime prevention efforts for students; (3) educate likely school-age victims in crime prevention and safety; (4) develop or expand community justice initiatives for students; (5) train students in conflict resolution, restorative justice, and crime awareness; (6) assist in the identification of physical changes in the environment that may reduce crime in or around the school; and (7) assist in developing school policy that addresses crime and recommend procedural changes.</summary>
