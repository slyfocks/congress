Establishes a Managed Care Consumer Advisory Commission to assist consumers in assessing services, understanding and exercising their rights and responsibilities, and making an informed and appropriate plan choice. (Sec. 3) Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require a group health plan (and a managed care plan offering group coverage) to comply with the above amendments to the Public Health Service Act. Declares that those requirements do not preempt State laws providing equivalent or stricter protections for individuals. (Sec. 4) Prohibits construing certain ERISA provisions (relating to preemption of State laws) to preclude any State cause of action for damages for personal injury or wrongful death against any person providing insurance or administrative services to an employee welfare benefit pan maintained to provide health benefits."
