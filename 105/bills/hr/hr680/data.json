    "text": "Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to add providers of assistance to families or individuals with annual incomes below the poverty line to the list of organizations eligible to receive surplus personal property allocated by the Administrator of the General Services Administration. Authorizes the Administrator, under such regulations as the Administrator may prescribe, to assign to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for disposal such surplus real property, including buildings, fixtures, and equipment situated thereon, as is recommended by the Secretary as being needed for providing housing or housing assistance for low-income individuals or families. Authorizes the Secretary, through such officers or employees of HUD as the Secretary may designate, to sell or lease such property for that purpose to any State, any political subdivision or instrumentality of a State, or any nonprofit organization that exists for the primary purpose of providing housing or housing assistance for low-income individuals or families, subject to the disapproval of the Administrator within 30 days after notice to the Administrator by the Secretary of a proposed transfer of property for the purpose of providing such housing or housing assistance. Requires the Administrator to disapprove a proposed transfer of property unless the Administrator determines that the property will be used for low-income housing opportunities through the construction, rehabilitation, or refurbishment of self-help housing, under terms requiring: (1) any individual or family receiving housing or housing assistance constructed, rehabilitated, or refurbished through the use of the property to contribute a significant amount of labor toward the construction, rehabilitation, or refurbishment; and (2) dwellings constructed, rehabilitated, or refurbished through the use of the property to be quality dwellings that comply with local building and safety codes and standards and to be available at prices below prevailing market prices. Directs the Administrator to ensure that nonprofit organizations that are sold or leased property develop and use guidelines to consider any disability of an individual for the purposes of fulfilling any self-help requirement. Directs the Secretary, in fixing the sale or lease value of property to be disposed of, to take into consideration and discount the value of any benefit that has accrued or may accrue to the United States from the use of such property by any such State, political subdivision, instrumentality, or nonprofit organization. Sets the amount of the discount at 75 percent of the market value of the property, except that the Secretary may discount by a greater percentage if the Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, determines that a higher percentage is justified."
