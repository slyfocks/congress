    "text": "Federal Surplus Property Reform Act of 1997 - Amends Federal law to repeal the authority of the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service to receive requests for the transfer to foreign countries or international organizations in foreign assistance or military sales programs of excess supplies of Department of Defense (DOD) construction and fire equipment. Authorizes the Administrator of General Services, instead, to receive such requests. Limits to nonlethal the type of excess supplies that may be transferred. Allows such transfer for humanitarian relief purposes. Requires the President to certify to the Congress the emergency necessity for any such transaction. Amends specified Federal law to repeal the general delegation to the Secretary of Defense of disposal authority over personal property. Repeals the mandate for DOD participation in infrastructure improvement demonstration programs conducted by Regional Equipment Centers in Newport Township and Cambria County, Pennsylvania. (Sec. 3) Repeals general authority to transfer surplus property to disadvantaged small businesses. (Sec. 4) Repeals the authority of the Secretary of Energy to transfer surplus equipment to an educational institution with which it has a partnership agreement. (Sec. 5) Amends the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 to repeal the authority of a Federal agency head or the director of a Federal laboratory to give excess research equipment to an educational institution or nonprofit organization. Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to delegate such transfer authority to the director of a Federal laboratory."
