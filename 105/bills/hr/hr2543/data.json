Amends SSA titles XVIII and XIX to require covered providers to provide for annual payment to the Secretary of appropriate amounts for the conduct of such audits. Makes appropriations to the Secretary from such payments for the sole purpose of conducting such audits. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on examining and accrediting agencies that audit and inspect covered providers."
