Amends the Weather Service Modernization Act to modify: (1) requirements regarding the restructuring of NWS field offices; and (2) the duties of the Modernization Transition Committee. Sets a termination date for the Committee. Encourages the NWS to form a working group with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding NWS operational use of FAA weather radar data. Requires that Department of Defense NEXRADs that provide primary detection coverage over a portion of their ranges function as fully committed, reliable elements (and be considered as integral parts) of the National Weather Radar Network. (Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) climate and air quality research; (2) atmospheric research; (3) modifications to the Boulder Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado; (4) satellite observing systems; and (5) environmental data and information services. Title II: Oceanography and Marine Research - Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) the Coastal Ocean Program; (2) data acquisition activities of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research; (3) ocean remote sensing; (4) marine prediction research; (5) Arctic research; (6) the National Undersea Research Program; and (7) ocean services. Authorizes NOAA to participate in the National Oceanic Partnership Program established by the National Oceanic Partnership Act. Title III: Program Support and Other Accounts - Authorizes appropriations for NOAA for: (1) executive direction and administrative activities; (2) Systems Acquisition Office activities; (3) central administrative support; and (4) aircraft services. Reduces the amount authorized to be appropriated under this Act by specified amounts to reflect the use of prior year balances. Title IV: Streamlining of Operations - Prohibits appropriating funds for seven specified programs, including National Weather Service Regional Climate Centers and the Goddard Science Center. Mandates a report to specified congressional committees certifying that all seven will be terminated by a specified date. (Sec. 402) Limits the total dollar amounts authorized to be appropriated by this or any other Act for NOAA for all activities associated with operations, research, and facilities or for capital assets acquisition. Title V: Miscellaneous - Makes it unlawful for any unauthorized person to remove, move, damage, or interfere with any National Data Buoy Center weather data buoy. Provides for civil monetary penalties and rewards. (Sec. 502) Makes the Secretary of Commerce, through the NWS, responsible for: (1) forecasts, serving as the sole official source of weather and flood warnings; (2) issuance of storm warnings; (3) collection, exchange, and distribution of meteorological, hydrological, climatic, and oceanographic data and information; and (4) preparation of hydrometeorological guidance and core forecast information. Prohibits the NWS from competing (or assisting other entities in competing) with the private sector when a service is or can be provided by commercial enterprise unless the private sector is unwilling or unable to provide the service. Removes existing provisions relating to the duties of the Secretary regarding weather forecasting. Mandates a report to specified congressional committees detailing all NWS activities not conforming to this paragraph and outlining a timetable for their termination. (Sec. 504) Mandates notice to specified congressional committees of any reprogramming of funds authorized by this Act and of any NOAA major reorganization. (Sec. 505) Declares the sense of the Congress regarding NOAA handling of the year 2000 computer systems problem. (Sec. 506) Prohibits an entity from spending funds appropriated under this Act unless the entity agrees to comply with provisions of Federal law commonly known as the Buy American Act. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that entities receiving financial assistance under this Act should spend the assistance to purchase only American-made equipment or products."
