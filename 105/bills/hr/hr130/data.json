Requires State implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards to contain adequate provisions prohibiting sources within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other area within the State with respect to any such air quality standard."
