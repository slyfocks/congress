  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to add to the current prohibition on the receipt by a former President of a monetary allowance the following two additional prohibitions: (1) no such allowance shall be paid for any month in which a former President has not attained retirement age, as defined by the Social Security Act; and (2) no such allowance shall be paid to a former President who is otherwise entitled to any other annuity or pension under any other Act of the Congress (excluding a survivor benefit and any benefit under Medicare), unless such former President waives the right to each such other annuity or pension. Repeals a provision directing the Administrator of General Services to furnish each former President suitable office space. Revises provisions concerning the authority of the Secret Service to protect a former President to, among other things, reduce the period of such protection from lifetime protection to protection for the one-year period immediately following the termination of a President's service as President, unless there is a threat to kill, kidnap, or do bodily harm to such former President.</summary>
