    "text": "China Sanctions and Human Rights Advancement Act - Prohibits the Secretary of State (except in the case of a presidential waiver in the U.S. national security interest) from issuing any visa to, and the Attorney General may not admit to the United States, certain high-ranking officials of the Chinese government who have been involved in limiting the free exercise of religion and other human rights in China. (Sec. 3) Mandates certain economic sanctions against China including: (1) votes and restrictions to deny multilateral assistance by international development banks; and (2) reduction in U.S. contributions to international development banks for multilateral assistance and to organizations providing family planning assistance in China. Directs the President to: (1) prohibit the importation of products (with specified exceptions) produced by the China Poly Group (also known as Polytechnologies Incorporated or BAOLI) or the China North Industries Group (Norinco); (2) deny or impose restrictions on the entry into the United States of foreign nationals employed by such entities; (3) prohibit the issuance of licenses for U.S. Munitions List exports to such nationals or entities; (4) prohibit the export of controlled goods or technology to them; (5) direct the Export-Import Bank of the United States not to approve the issuance of credit to them; (6) prohibit U.S. nationals from issuing guarantees for loans or investments, or extending credit, to them; and (7) prohibit U.S. agencies and U.S. nationals from entering into any contract with such nationals or entities for the procurement of goods or services. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should consult with its major allies and trading partners in order to encourage them to adopt similar sanctions against China. Requires a report to the Congress on such consultations. (Sec. 4) Directs the President to report annually to the Congress on China's practices with respect to the free exercise of religion and other human rights during the preceding year. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of State to publish in the Federal Register a list of corporations that were owned in whole or in part by the Chinese People's Liberation Army as of December 31 of the preceding year. (Sec. 6) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Attorney General to establish a program to provide training on religious persecution to U.S. immigration officers. (Sec. 7) Declares that FY 1998 funding levels for certain U.S. Information Agency programs and grants for student, cultural, and legislative exchange activities with China, for Radio Free Asia, and for China-related programs of the National Endowment for Democracy shall not be less than FY 1997 funding levels. (Sec. 8) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the transfers by China of chemical and missile weapons equipment and technology to Iran and Pakistan poses a threat to the national security interests of the United States; (2) the failure of the Clinton Administration to initiate a process to determine whether to impose sanctions for such transfers contributes to such threat by the proliferation of such equipment and technology; and (3) the President should immediately initiate such process to determine whether such sanctions should be imposed. Directs the President to report to the Congress on the process to determine whether to impose sanctions against China for such transfers."
