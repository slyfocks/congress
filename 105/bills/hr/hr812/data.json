    "text": "Patent Sovereignty Act of 1997 - Amends Federal patent law to declare all examination and search duties for the grant of U.S. letters patent to be sovereign functions which shall be performed within the United States by U.S. citizens who are Government employees. Requires (current law authorizes) the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to revise and maintain the classification by subject matter of all U.S. letters patent. Requires such patents, and all such other patents and printed publications, to be maintained in the examiners' search files under the U.S. Patent Classification System. Requires all patent examiners to spend at least five percent of their annual duty time in training to maintain and develop legal and technical skills useful for patent examination. Directs the Patent and Trademark Office (Office) to develop an incentive program to retain patent examiners of primary examiner grade or higher to train other patent examiners who have not achieved such grade. Prohibits the Office from being subject to any administratively or statutorily imposed limitations on positions or personnel. Allows patent fees to be retained by the Office to carry out its activities, including the training of patent examiners, in such allocations as approved by the Congress. Requires the Office to make public all Office solicitations for goods and services, as well as all such contracts entered into by the Office. Requires publication in the Federal Register of notice of a proposal to change U.S. patent law that will be made on behalf of the United States to a foreign country or international body."
