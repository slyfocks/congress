Allows the Commission, in unusual and compelling circumstances, to permit a person or entity to own, operate, or control, or to have a cognizable interest in, two VHF television stations within the same television market if the applicant demonstrates that it will not significantly harm competition or the preservation of a diversity of media voices in that market."
