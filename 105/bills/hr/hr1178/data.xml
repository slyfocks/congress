  <summary>3/20/1997--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to authorize the use of sampling to determine the total U.S. population by State with respect to the decennial census for purposes of the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, provided it is used in conjunction with a good faith effort using non-sampling techniques and is necessary in order to achieve a more accurate census. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, with respect to each decennial and mid-decade census, to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) how it is proposed that the actual enumeration be carried out; (2) what types of surveys or statistical methods are proposed to be used in connection with such enumeration; and (3) how such surveys or methods would help achieve a more accurate census. Requires collection: (1) as part of the decennial census of population or population and housing characteristics data that is used for purposes of determining benefits to State, county, or local units of government; and (2) contemporaneously with the collection of data for purposes of the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States. Authorizes collection of such data through sampling.</summary>
