    "text": "Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act of 1997 - Makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, package, or distribute cigarettes, spit tobacco products, or other tobacco products for sale unless: (1) the package bears one of specified warnings and discloses (for cigarettes, contains an insert disclosing) ingredients; and (2) the advertising bears one of the specified warnings. Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the warnings. Requires each manufacturer, packager, or importer of any tobacco product to report annually on ingredients. Directs the Secretary: (1) if the Secretary finds the information directly affects public health, to require inclusion of the information in labeling and inserts required by this Act; and (2) to establish a toll-free telephone number and an Internet site to make additional ingredient information available. Requires that the Secretary carry out the Secretary's duties under this Act through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Allows any nonprofit organization (a substantial part of the activities of which include promoting public health through reducing tobacco use) to bring a civil action for an injunction. Mandates a civil monetary penalty for violations. Declares that compliance with this Act, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, or the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 shall not relieve any person from liability to any other person at common law or under State statutory law."
