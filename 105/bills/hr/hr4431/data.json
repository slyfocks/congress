    "text": "HIV Partner Protection Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit a grant to a State under provisions relating to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care grants unless the State: (1) carries out a program of notification of sex or needle sharing partners of individuals with HIV disease that the partners may have been exposed; (2) requires HIV testing entities to confidentially report positive test results, including the individual's name, to the State; (3) does not inform partners of the infected individual's identity; (4) meets certain counseling, testing, and referral requirements; (5) there is no criminal or civil penalty or civil liability for an infected individual if the individual chooses not to identify their partners or for an individual who makes a good faith error in submitting reports or making disclosures; and (6) the failure of the State to notify partners is not a basis for civil liability of any health entity who reported to the State the identity of the infected individual. Prohibits such a grant unless a State prohibits insurers from taking any action against an individual solely on the basis that the individual has been tested for HIV disease. Authorizes grants to States to assist with the costs of carrying out the program. Authorizes appropriations."
