Directs the Director of the National Science Foundation to enter into an agreement with the National Research Council for a review of the implementation of this Act. Mandates a report to the Congress containing the results of that review, including the conclusions of the National Research Council on: (1) the impact that the implementation of this Act has had on research; and (2) recommendations for any appropriate changes to this Act. States that nothing in this Act shall restrict other areas of scientific research not specifically prohibited by this Act, including important and promising work that involves: (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells other than human embryo cells, or tissues; or (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals other than humans. Expresses the sense of the Congress that other countries should establish substantially equivalent prohibitions."
