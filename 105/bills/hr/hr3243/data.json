    "text": "Alternative Water Source Development Act of 1998 - Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program for making grants for the development and construction of alternative water source projects to State, interstate, and intrastate water resource development agencies and local government agencies that have authority to develop water resources for potable, commercial, industrial, or agricultural uses. Permits grants only for agencies in States experiencing critical water supply needs. Requires the Administrator to carry out such program to: (1) demonstrate methods of developing alternative water source technologies; and (2) protect groundwater from overpumping and to preserve minimum flows and levels of surface water bodies. Permits grants only to agencies that have: (1) engaged in a planning effort to assess the availability of water resources and the need to develop alternative sources and have produced a comprehensive water resource plan to meet expected water resource needs for a 20-year period; (2) demonstrated that currently available water resources will not be sufficient to provide for expected potable, commercial, industrial, and agricultural needs over the next 20 years; and (3) agreed to provide 50 percent of the cost of the project to be funded with the grant. Makes agencies of States eligible for assistance or receiving funds under the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 ineligible for grants under this Act. Requires the Administrator to report to the Congress on the program, together with an analysis of whether program purposes have been realized and recommendations for administrative and legislative actions. Authorizes appropriations."
