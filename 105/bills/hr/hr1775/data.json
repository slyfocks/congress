Specifies that the amounts authorized to be appropriated and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1998, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees and the President. Allows the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 1998 when the DCI determines that such action is necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions, subject to specified limitations. Requires notification of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees whenever such authority is exercised. Authorizes appropriations for the Community Management Account of the DCI for FY 1998. Authorizes full-time personnel for the Community Management Staff of the DCI as of September 30, 1998. Provides for the reimbursement of any U.S. officer or employee, or member of the armed forces, who is detailed to such Staff. Earmarks Account funds for the National Drug Intelligence Center. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1998 for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. Title III: General Provisions - Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees to be increased by such additional amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 304) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to authorize the detail of employees within the intelligence community to positions in the Intelligence Community Assignment Program, for a maximum of three years with an additional one-year extension in the public interest. Requires an annual report from the DCI to the intelligence committees. Terminates the detail program on September 30, 2002. (Sec. 305) Extends through January 6, 1999, the authority of the President to stay the application of certain sanctions against a foreign country, organization, or person upon a determination of an adverse effect of such sanction on the conduct of ongoing intelligence activities. (Sec. 306) Requires entities receiving funds pursuant to this Act to comply with the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that such entities should purchase only American-made equipment and products. Requires notice to such entities of such requirement. (Sec. 308) Makes ineligible for the receipt of any funds provided under this Act any person found to have intentionally affixed a fraudulent \"Made in America\" label to any product sold in or shipped into the United States. (Sec. 309) Requires the DCI and the FBI Director to jointly submit to the Congress an annual report on those intelligence activities of the People's Republic of China which affect U.S. interests.
