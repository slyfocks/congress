Section 8 Housing Improvement Act - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to authorize a public housing agency to limit the number of section 8 assisted rental families in its jurisdiction if the agency determines such restriction is necessary to preserve an area's property values, safety, or unique character. Requires each agency to establish and maintain a neighborhood review committee which shall: (1) be made up of between three and six agency-area residents, of whom at least three must not be receiving housing assistance other than mortgage assistance; and (2) obtain and review references and certain enforcement-related information respecting assisted families and landlords. Sets forth section 8 housing quality standards enforcement provisions.</summary>
