Requires each agency to establish and maintain a neighborhood review committee which shall: (1) be made up of between three and six agency-area residents, of whom at least three must not be receiving housing assistance other than mortgage assistance; and (2) obtain and review references and certain enforcement-related information respecting assisted families and landlords. Sets forth section 8 housing quality standards enforcement provisions."
