    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Amendments to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 Title II: Amendments to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 - Title I: Amendments to the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 - Amends the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to include entitlement authority and the food stamp program within the definition of \"budget authority.\" Excludes salary or basic pay funded through an appropriation from the definition of \"entitlement authority.\" (Sec. 105) Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (the Act) to require the concurrent resolution on the budget to set forth planning levels for at least the four (currently, two) ensuing fiscal years. Revises Senate pay-as-you-go authorities to permit revisions of committee allocations, aggregates, and other levels for legislation within a committee's jurisdiction if such legislation would not increase the deficit for the first year, and for the five fiscal years, covered by the budget resolution. (Sec. 106) Consolidates requirements currently set forth separately for the House of Representatives and the Senate with respect to committee allocations. Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on a budget resolution to include allocations of the appropriate levels, for each fiscal year and a total for all years, of new budget authority, outlays, and, in the Senate, Social Security outlays, among each House and Senate committee with jurisdiction over legislation providing or creating such amounts. Requires levels only for the first fiscal year in the case of the Appropriations Committee. Provides that no legislation involving a change in Internal Revenue Code provisions regarding tax on individuals shall be treated as affecting the amount of Social Security revenues or outlays unless such legislation changes the income tax treatment of Social Security benefits. Requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee, if a concurrent budget resolution is not adopted by April 15, to submit to the House an allocation consistent with the discretionary spending limits contained in the most recently agreed to budget resolution for the second fiscal year covered by such resolution. Revises provisions regarding points of order with respect to consideration of legislation that would cause allocations or suballocations of new budget authority or outlays in a budget resolution to be exceeded. (Sec. 107) Makes a prohibition on considering legislation until the concurrent budget resolution has been agreed to inapplicable to a House bill or resolution that provides advance discretionary new budget authority which first becomes available in a fiscal year following the fiscal year to which the concurrent budget resolution applies. (Sec. 110) Revises items of authority the amounts of which are to be changed for purposes of budget reconciliation to exclude credit authority and include direct spending (including entitlement authority). (Sec. 111) Applies a point of order against legislation that would cause revenues to be less than those set forth in the concurrent budget resolution for a fiscal year or the total of all fiscal years covered by the resolution. Makes it out of order in the Senate to consider any legislation that would cause a decrease in Social Security surpluses or an increase in Social Security deficits derived from the levels of Social Security revenues and outlays set forth for the first fiscal year, and for the period of five fiscal years, covered by the concurrent budget resolution. (Sec. 112) Prohibits points of order against legislation in the Senate while an amendment to such legislation which would remedy violations of the Act is pending. (Sec. 113) Provides for adjustments to discretionary spending limits, allocations, and budgetary aggregates to reflect new budget authority and additional outlays from: (1) appropriations measures for any of FY 1998 through 2002 reported by the Appropriations Committee that specify amounts for emergencies or continuing disability reviews; (2) specified emergency legislation reported by other committees; (3) appropriations measures for such fiscal years reported by the Appropriations Committee that include specified amounts for the U.S. quota of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Eleventh General Review of Quotas or increased amounts for the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to new arrangements to borrow under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act; (4) appropriations measures reported by the Appropriations Committee for FY 1998, 1999, or 2000 that include up to a specified amount for arrearages for international organizations, international peacekeeping, and multilateral development banks; or (5) any conference report on these measures. Repeals provisions that require levels of budget authority or outlays and revenues to be determined on the basis of Budget Committee estimates. (Sec. 114) Exempts legislation from points of order in the House if a self-executing rule for consideration of such legislation modifies provisions that violate the Act. (Sec. 115) Makes certain controls on bills providing new spending authority applicable to bills providing new credit authority. (Sec. 116) Repeals title VI (budget agreement enforcement provisions) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (some of which is incorporated into this Act). Title II: Amendments to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 - Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to extend discretionary spending limits through FY 2002. (Sec. 203) Repeals a provision that exempts the net costs of FY 1997 appropriations for certain loan guarantees to Israel for resettling immigrants from such limits. Revises provisions regarding a special outlay allowance in cases where outlays for a spending category exceed discretionary spending limits but new budget authority does not exceed its limit to require the adjustment in outlays to be the amount of the excess up to 0.5 percent of the adjusted limits on outlays for that fiscal year in FY 1997 or any fiscal year though 2002. Provides that, if an appropriations bill or joint resolution is enacted for any of FY 1998 through 2002 that includes an appropriation with respect to the following, the adjustment shall be the amount of budget authority in the measure that is the dollar equivalent in Special Drawing Rights of an increase in the: (1) U.S. quota of the IMF; or (2) maximum amount available to the Secretary of the Treasury under the Bretton Woods Agreements Act with respect to new arrangements to borrow. Provides that, if an appropriations bill or joint resolution is enacted for any of FY 1998 through 2000 that includes an appropriation for arrearages for international organizations or peacekeeping and multilateral banks, the adjustment shall be the amount of budget authority and outlays flowing in all fiscal years from such authority. Limits the total amount of such adjustments. Sets forth discretionary spending limits for: (1) the discretionary category for FY 1997 and FY 2000 through 2002; (2) the defense, nondefense, and violent crime reduction categories for FY 1998; and (3) the defense and nondefense categories for FY 1999. (Sec. 204) Repeals provisions regarding sequestration for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. (Sec. 205) States that the purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation enacted prior to FY 2002 affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration. Revises sequestration provisions to require a sequestration to offset deficit increases in a budget year caused by direct spending and receipts legislation and deficit increases in the prior fiscal year caused by such legislation which is not reflected in the final OMB sequestration report for that year. Includes CBO and OMB estimates (other than amounts for emergencies) of the budgetary effect of legislation that are not reflected in the final OMB sequestration report for the current year within the OMB's calculation of the deficit increase. Requires OMB and CBO estimates to include the amount of change in outlays or receipts for the current and budget year and for each outyear. (Sec. 206) Extends sequestration reporting requirements through FY 2002. (Sec. 207) Adds and removes specified items to and from the lists of items exempt from reductions under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. (Sec. 208) Removes the National Wool Act from the list of indices whose changes trigger automatic spending increases. Revises origination fee requirements for student loans made during a sequestration period. Includes annual adjustments to Federal pay schedules and locality-based pay in Federal pay subject to reductions. Exempts administrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration from reductions. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, as the sole means of achieving a reduction in outlays under the milk price support program, to provide for a reduction to be made in the price received by producers for all milk produced in the United States and marketed for commercial use. Makes budgetary resources sequestered in revolving, trust, and special fund accounts available in years subsequent to the year in which a sequestration occurs. (Sec. 209) Revises baseline provisions to provide that a program with estimated current year outlays greater than $50 million may be assumed to expire in the budget year or outyears if so provided by legislation establishing or modifying that program. (Current law states that such programs shall not be assumed to expire in such years.) Provides that such legislation shall not be subject to a point of order solely for including such a provision. Requires any program with estimated current year outlays greater than such amount which operates under any law which expires before the budget year or any outyear to be assumed to continue to operate as in effect before such law's expiration. Requires the inflator used to adjust budgetary resources (other than those relating to personnel) to be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross domestic product chain-type price index (currently, the national product fixed-weight price index) for a fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year. (Sec. 213) Requires the Director of OMB to: (1) reduce any balances of direct spending and receipts legislation for fiscal years prior to 2002 to zero; and (2) not make any estimates of changes in direct spending outlays and receipts for any fiscal year resulting from the enactment of this Act or the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997."
