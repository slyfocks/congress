  <summary>4/30/1997--Introduced.
Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide financial assistance to private organizations to conduct three-year women's business development programs (currently called demonstration projects) for the benefit of small businesses owned and controlled by women. Deletes provisions concerning possible non-Federal source cash contributions to such organizations for such programs received on or before FY 1993. Repeals a provision prohibiting the SBA from providing such assistance to any new project after October 1, 1997.</summary>
