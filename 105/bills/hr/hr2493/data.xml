TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Management of Grazing on Federal Lands Title II: Miscellaneous Forage Improvement Act of 1997 - Title I: Management of Grazing on Federal Lands - Sets forth the application of this title under specified laws to grazing management on Federal lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior (Bureau of Land Management lands), the Secretary of Agriculture (Forest Service lands), and certain other U.S. lands. (Sec. 102) Defines specified terms, including "sixteen contiguous Western States" (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming). (Sec. 103) States that monitoring of conditions on Federal lands within grazing allotments shall be: (1) performed by Federal, State, or local personnel, grazing permittees and lessees, or professional consultants; and (2) site specific, scientific, and conducted according to regional or State criteria. (Sec. 104) Prohibits grazing permit subleasing for livestock not owned or controlled by the permittee or lessee. (Sec. 105) Permits an allotment plan or grazing permit to include a written agreement with a qualified permittee or lessee for outcome-based standards. (Sec. 106) States that the fee for each animal unit month (as defined in this Act) in a grazing fee year shall equal the 12-year average of the total gross beef cattle production value (as determined by the Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service) for the 12 preceding years multiplied by the 12-year average six-month Treasury bill new issue rate, divided by 12. Establishes a separate fee for foreign-owned or -controlled grazing permits or leases. Exempts an animal from being counted that is less than six months old on the date it begins grazing and is the progeny of a fee-paid animal if it is removed from such grazing land before reaching 12 months old. Directs the Economic Research Service to continue to compile and report the gross value of beef cattle production as currently published. Title II: Miscellaneous - States that this Act shall become effective on the first day of the first grazing season after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 202) Directs the Secretaries to publish implementing regulations within 180 days after enactment of this Act.</summary>
