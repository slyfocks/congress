  <summary>3/18/1997--Passed House amended.
Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit, notwithstanding any statute, rule, or other provision of law, a United States district court from ordering any victim of an offense excluded from the trial of a defendant accused of that offense because such victim may, during the sentencing hearing: (1) make a statement or present any information in relation to the sentence; and (2) testify as to the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim's family or as to any other factor for which notice is required. Specifies that the fact that a victim attended or observed the trial shall not be construed to pose a danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury. Makes this Act applicable in cases pending on the date of this Act's enactment.</summary>
