National Energy Laboratories Reorganization Commission Act of 1997 - Establishes the National Energy Laboratories Reorganization Commission to reorganize the Department of Energy National Energy Laboratories and their programs through reconfiguration, corporatization, privatization, and consolidation, while preserving the traditional role the energy laboratories have contributed to the national defense. Requires the Commission to report its own recommendations to specified congressional committees, giving strong consideration to the recommendations of the Task Force on Alternative Futures for the Department of Energy National Laboratories (Galvin Commission). Directs the Secretary to Energy to reconfigure all energy laboratories and complete their corporatization and privatization according to Commission recommendations. Establishes the National Energy Laboratories Reorganization Account to fund such reconfiguration. Instructs the Secretary to transmit to such congressional committees: (1) a reconfiguration schedule as part of the budget request for each pertinent fiscal year; and (2) a description of the energy laboratories to which functions are to be transferred as a result of such reconfigurations. Prescribes procedural guidelines for congressional consideration of the Commission's report.</summary>
