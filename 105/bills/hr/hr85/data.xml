  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Bombing Prevention Act - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit the transport, shipment, or receipt of explosive materials in interstate or foreign commerce without a permit or the distribution of explosive materials in interstate or foreign commerce to anyone other than a licensee or permittee. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to notify the States of the regulations so that they may consider revising their explosives laws. (Sec. 4) Requires applicants for licenses and user permits to import, manufacture, or deal in explosive materials to provide fingerprints and a photograph. Sets fees of up to $300 for an applicant for a license and up to $100 for an applicant for a permit. (Currently, the fee is up to $200 for each license or permit.) (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to use the national instant criminal background check system established under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to investigate applicants for licenses or permits. (Sec. 6) Repeals exceptions from specified explosive materials requirements with respect to components of small arms ammunition and small quantities of black powder or smokeless powder. (Sec. 7) Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate amendments to the sentencing guidelines to appropriately enhance the penalties for violations of Federal explosive materials provisions so that such penalties are the same as those for comparable violations of Federal firearms laws. (Sec. 8) Subjects to civil forfeiture (with exceptions) any property involved in a violation of explosive materials provisions, or in a conspiracy to commit such a violation, and any other property traceable to such property. Directs the court to order a person convicted of a violation of Federal explosive materials provisions or of conspiring to commit such a violation to forfeit any property involved and any traceable property.</summary>
