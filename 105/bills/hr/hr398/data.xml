  <summary>1/9/1997--Introduced.
Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to exempt owners or operators of pesticide rinse water degradation systems from the requirement of obtaining a permit for the treatment or disposal of pesticide rinse water if the system: (1) uses evaporation and biological degradation to treat or dispose of such water; (2) contains an above-ground tank or double-walled tank that can be inspected for leaks; (3) includes a secondary containment system capable of collecting and containing any leaks from the tank; (4) does not discharge fluid; (5) is protected from rainfall; and (6) when it is dismantled or any matrix or media used in the tank is replaced, if the matrix or media contains any hazardous waste, the matrix or media is treated, stored, or disposed of in accordance with hazardous waste management requirements. Defines "pesticide rinse water degradation system" as a system for treating or disposing of water used to rinse pesticide application equipment. Applies this Act to systems in operation as of January 1, 1987.</summary>
