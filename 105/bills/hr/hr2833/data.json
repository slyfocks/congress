Authorizes the United States to make contributions to the Fund only if the President certifies to the Congress that, among other things, disbursements from the Fund will be distributed to individuals or entities whose practices are consistent with the principles of economic justice and will create employment opportunities in communities of Northern Ireland suffering the highest rates of unemployment. Sets forth the MacBride principles of economic justice."
