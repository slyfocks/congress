Real Estate Transaction Privacy Promotion Act - Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 to prohibit a creditor from requiring a borrower to furnish (through a copy of Internal Revenue Service Form 4506) open-ended access to such borrower's tax records as a condition of making a federally related mortgage loan, unless the form: (1) is fully completed before signing by the borrower; (2) specifically requests tax information for not more than the two tax periods most recently completed as of the date that the form is signed; and (3) is completed, signed, and dated not later than the date of settlement involving such loan. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to explain such proscription and attendant penalties in the special information booklet mandated by the Act.</summary>
