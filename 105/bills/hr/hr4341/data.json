Requires the Secretary to act through the Director of the National Park Service and consult with the State of Colorado and the tribes of the Cheyenne and Arapaho of Oklahoma, the Northern Cheyenne, and the Northern Arapaho (the Tribes). Requires the study to: (1) identify the location and extent of the massacre area and the suitability and feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System; and (2) include cost estimates for any necessary acquisition, development, operation and maintenance, and identification of alternatives for the management and protection of the area. Directs the Secretary to record and incorporate into the resource study oral histories of the Sand Creek Massacre that have been passed down to descendants of its survivors within the Tribes, to the extent practical. Authorizes appropriations."
