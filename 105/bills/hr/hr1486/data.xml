Title II: Consolidation of Certain International Affairs Agencies - Chapter 1: General Provisions - International Affairs Agency Consolidation Act of 1997 - Chapter 2: United States International Development Cooperation Agency - Abolishes the United States International Development Cooperation Agency, and transfers all functions of the Director of such agency to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). (Sec. 221) Provides for: (1) the continuation of USAID as a Federal agency; and (2) the Administrator of USAID to be under the direction of the Secretary of State. Title III: Foreign Assistance Reform - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise requirements for the annual report to the Congress on foreign assistance programs. Replaces responsibility for such report from the Chairman of the Development Coordination Committee to the President. (Sec. 301) Directs the President, as part of the annual requests for foreign assistance program authorizations and appropriations, to submit to the Congress annual congressional presentation documents that provide, among other things, the amount, the rationale, and the direct U.S. national interest for the allocation of assistance provided under this Act and the Arms Export Control Act to each foreign country or international organization. Requires the President, as part of such documents, to estimate the year in which each country will no longer receive bilateral development assistance. (Sec. 302) Urges the President for FY 1998 and 1999 to allocate foreign assistance funds to private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in a manner that reflects the increase in the funding of such entities since FY 1995. (Sec. 303) Replaces the Private Sector Revolving Fund with a program of assistance (including loans, guarantees, and training) to increase the availability of credit to micro- and small enterprises. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 304) Authorizes the Administrator of USAID to provide grant assistance for programs of credit and other assistance for microenterprises in developing countries. Directs the Administrator to establish a monitoring system establishing performance goals for such assistance. (Sec. 305) Authorizes the President to provide funds and support to private sector Enterprise Funds for countries eligible to receive development assistance on the same basis as such funds and support are provided to Enterprise Funds for Poland and Hungary under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989. (Sec. 306) Authorizes the President to use certain Development Credit Authority to promote: (1) micro- and small enterprise development; and (2) certain urban and environmental activities.
