    "text": "Anti-Money Laundering and Paycheck Accountability Act - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to: (1) ban the use of non-Federal funds by political parties for specified activities, unless the funds are subject to FECA (with exceptions); and (2) limit the amount a person may contribute to a political party for excepted party-building activities. Requires annual written authorization permitting the withholding of an individual's wages or salary to be used by any person receiving the withheld amounts for political activities. Prohibits a candidate for Federal office or a Federal officeholder from establishing, maintaining, financing, or controlling a leadership committee. Revises requirements for notification by the candidate's principal campaign committee of large contributions to require each political committee to report within 24 hours all contributions received by the committee within 20 days of an election. Directs the Federal Election Commission to make the information contained in the reports submitted available on the Internet and publicly available at Commission offices within 24 hours after the information is received by the Commission."
