Defines \"unsafe handgun\" as any semiautomatic pistol which does not have a magazine safety disconnect that prevents the pistol from being fired once the magazine or clip is removed from the weapon and any handgun: (1) which the Secretary of the Treasury determines, when new, fires in any of five successive trials in which the handgun is dropped onto a solid slab of concrete from a height of one meter from each of several specified positions; (2) without a child resistant trigger mechanism reasonably designed to prevent a child who has attained age five from operating the weapon when it is ready to fire; and (3) sold without a mechanism reasonably designed, under rules determined by the Secretary, to prevent the discharge of the weapon by unauthorized users. Exempts the manufacture or importation by a licensed manufacturer or importer for use by a department or agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof, or for purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the Secretary. (Sec. 102) Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to study and report to the Congress on how handgun safety can be improved so as to prevent unauthorized use or discharge of firearms by children who have not attained age 18. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999. Title II: The Children's Firearms Age Limit Act of 1998 - Prohibits the sale, delivery, or other transfer of a semiautomatic assault weapon to a person the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile. (Sec. 202) Increases the penalty for transferring a handgun or semiautomatic assault weapon to a juvenile for use in a crime of violence. Title III: The Children's Firearm Dealer's Responsibility Act of 1998 - Directs the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to revoke the license of a dealer who willfully sells a firearm to a minor. (Sec. 302) Prohibits a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer, 30 days after the Attorney General notifies licensees that the national instant criminal background check system is established, from transferring a firearm to any unlicensed person without verifying the identity of a purchaser known or reasonably believed to be under age 24 by examining two valid photograph identification documents. (Sec. 303) Directs the Secretary to issue final regulations that establish minimum firearm safety and security standards that shall apply to dealers who are issued a license, which shall include minimum standards for: (1) a place of business in which a dealer covered by the regulations conducts business or stores firearms; (2) windows, the front door, storage rooms, containers, alarms, and specified other items of a place of business; and (3) the storage and handling of the firearms contained in such place of business. Authorizes the Secretary to enter the place of business of a licensed dealer: (1) under specified conditions, where there is reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred, to examine records of the safety and security measures taken by the dealer to ensure compliance with such regulations; and (2) without such reasonable cause or warrant not more than once during any 12-month period to ensure compliance. Sets penalties for licensed dealers who knowingly fail to comply with any applicable regulation issued pursuant to this section. Title IV: The Children's Firearm Access Prevention Act of 1998 - Children's Firearm Access Prevention Act of 1998 - Prohibits and sets penalties for keeping a loaded firearm, or an unloaded firearm and ammunition for it, that has been shipped or transported in or otherwise substantially affects interstate or foreign commerce, on premises under the custody or control of a person who knows or reasonably should know that a juvenile is capable of gaining access to the firearm without the permission of a parent or legal guardian, if a juvenile obtains access to the firearm and thereby causes death or bodily injury or exhibits the firearm in a public place or in a school zone. Makes an exception if: (1) the juvenile obtains, or obtains and discharges, the firearm in a lawful act of self-defense or defense of others; (2) the person uses a secure gun storage or safety device for the firearm; (3) the person is a peace officer, member of the Armed Forces or National Guard, and the juvenile obtains the firearm during or incidental to the performance of official duties in that capacity; or (4) the person has no reasonable expectation that a juvenile is likely to be present on the premises on which the firearm is kept. Requires the Secretary to ensure that a copy of such prohibition and penalties appears on the form required to be obtained by a licensed dealer from a prospective firearm purchaser. Title V: The Children's Firearm Injury Surveillance Act of 1998 - Children's Firearm Injury Surveillance Act of 1998 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) make grants to State and local departments of health and law enforcement agencies for establishing and maintaining children's firearm-related injury surveillance systems; and (2) carry out this title through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who shall carry out this title through the Director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (Director). Requires the Director to: (1) ensure that such grants are used to establish systems for gathering information regarding fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries involving children who have not attained age 21; and (2) give priority to States and communities in which firearm- related injuries for children are a significant public health problem. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2003. Title VI: The Children's Firearm Education Act of 1998 - Children's Firearm Education Act of 1998 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education or State educational agencies (if the amount appropriated to carry out this title exceeds $50 million) to award grants to eligible local educational agencies for purposes of educating children about preventing gun violence. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) a formula for allocating appropriated funds to the States; (2) minimum allotments; (3) required assurances regarding the use of allocated funds; (4) priorities in awarding grants; (6) peer review of grant applications; (7) eligible grant recipients; (8) State and local applications, and reporting requirements; (9) authorized activities; and (10) requirements that funds received supplement, not supplant, funds that would otherwise be available from non-Federal sources and that persons hired by a local educational agency receiving a grant award not displace persons already employed. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1999 through 2001. (Sec. 603) Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) include on the Internet site of the Department of Education a description of programs that receive grants pursuant to this title; and (2) publicize the competitive grant program through its Internet site, publications, and public service announcements. (Sec. 605) Amends the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 to provide for timely counseling and: (1) evaluations of any student who possesses, or threatens to bring or use, a weapon on school grounds; and (2) advice to public school students, staff, and administrators after an incident of gun-related violence on school grounds. Title VII: The Children's Firearm Tracking Act of 1998 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) endeavor to expand the number of cities and counties directly participating in the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII) to 75 cities or counties by October 1, 2000, 150 by October 1, 2002, and 250 by October 1, 2003; (2) select cities and counties for participation in YCGII in consultation with Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials; (3) utilize the information provided by YCGII to facilitate the identification and prosecution of individuals illegally trafficking firearms to persons under age 24; (4) share information derived from YCGII with State and local law enforcement agencies through on-line computer access as soon as such capability is available; and (5) award grants to States, cities, and counties for purposes of assisting in the tracing of firearms and participation in YCGII. Authorizes such grants to be used to: (1) hire or assign additional personnel for the gathering, submission, and analysis of tracing data submitted to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms under YCGII; (2) hire additional law enforcement personnel to identify and arrest individuals illegally trafficking firearms; and (3) purchase additional equipment, including automatic data processing equipment and computer software and hardware, for the timely submission and analysis of tracing data."
