(Sec. 102) Modifies requirements regarding petitions to issue a regulation on health-related claims. (Sec. 103) Allows a health or nutrient content claim not authorized by the Secretary if: (1) a U.S. governmental scientific body with public health protection or research responsibility directly relating to human nutrition or the National Academy of Sciences has published an authoritative statement, currently in effect, about the relationship to which the health claim refers or that identifies the nutrient level to which the nutrient claim refers; (2) a person has notified the Secretary; (3) the claim and food are in compliance with certain requirements; and (4) the claim is stated in a way that it is an accurate representation of the authoritative statement and in a way that it enables the public to understand the information and its significance. (Sec. 105) Requires, if a nutrient claim is made and the food contains a nutrient at a level that increases to persons in the general population the risk of a disease or health-related condition that is diet-related, that the label contain, close to the claim, a statement referring to the nutrition information elsewhere on the label. (Sec. 107) Mandates a: (1) final determination on any pending petition that would permit red meat irradiation; and (2) report to specified congressional committees regarding the process followed in reviewing that petition. (Sec. 108) Prohibits: (1) implementation of any requirement banning, as an unapproved food additive, lead and cadmium based paints in the lip and rim area of glass and ceramic ware before one year after the requirement is published; and (2) banning such paints on glass and ceramic ware meeting specified criteria. (Sec. 109) Deems a food contact substance (a substance used as a component of materials used in manufacturing, packing, packaging, transporting, or holding food, but not intended to have any technical effect in the food) unsafe and the food adulterated unless: (1) there is (and the substance is in conformity with) a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the substance may be safely used; or (2) the manufacturer or supplier has notified the Secretary of the identity and intended use of the substance and the manufacturer's or supplier's determination that the substance is safe under a specified standard. (Sec. 110) Revises oleomargarine sale and labeling requirements. Repeals provisions relating to: (1) a congressional declaration of policy regarding oleomargarine sales; and (2) noncontravention of State oleomargarine laws. Title II: Effective Date - Makes this Act and its amendments effective on enactment."
