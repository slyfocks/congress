Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997 - Amends the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 to direct the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to establish a program to support communities in the development and implementation of comprehensive, long-term plans and programs to prevent and treat substance abuse among youth. Requires grants to be made to coalitions of representatives of youth, parents, businesses, the media, schools, youth organizations, law enforcement, religious or fraternal organizations, civic groups, health care professionals, State, local, or tribal governmental agencies, and other organizations. Requires the Director, in carrying out the Program, to: (1) make and track grants to grant recipients; (2) provide for technical assistance and training, data collection and dissemination of information on state-of-the-art practices that the Director determines to be effective in reducing substance abuse; and (3) provide for the general administration of the Program. Directs the Director to enter into contracts with national drug control agencies, including interagency agreements to delegate authority for the execution of grants and to carry out this Act.

Prescribes limitations concerning: (1) grant amounts; (2) coalition awards; and (3) rural coalition grants. Grants the Program Administrator general auditing and data collection authority. Requires the minimization of reporting requirements by grant recipients. Authorizes the Administrator, with respect to any grant recipient or other organization, to: (1) offer technical assistance and training and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements; and (2) facilitate the coordination of programs between a grant recipient and other organizations, and entities. Authorizes the Administrator to provide training to any representative designated by a grant recipient in: (1) coalition building; (2) task force development; (3) mediation and facilitation, direct service, assessment and evaluation; or (4) any other activity related to the purposes of the Program.
