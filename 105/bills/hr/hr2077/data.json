(Sec. 5) Establishes the Giant Sequoia National Forest Preserve as a unit of the National Forest System for the: (1) protection and maintenance of giant sequoia groves, their supporting ecosystems, and associated forests; and (2) preservation of the natural state and processes that have created and maintained such forests. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to appoint a Scientific Advisory Team for the Preserve.

Provides for interim Preserve management by the Secretary. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary, as part of the management plan, to designate and map the ancient forest reserves within the Preserve. (Sec. 10) Requires the management plan to include a comprehensive transportation plan that protects natural Preserve features while ensuring visitor safety and that includes a trail plan identifying which trails will allow motorized access. (Sec. 11) Allows all current campgrounds within the Preserve to remain in place, subject to evaluation by the Secretary. Directs the Secretary to provide new camping opportunities. (Sec. 12) Authorizes the continued use of Preserve areas for hunting and fishing, firewood collection, and grazing, but prohibits new patents from being issued under the mining or geothermal laws. (Sec. 16) Directs the Secretary to establish a Community Assistance Task Force to oversee the provision of assistance to communities and workers in political subdivisions whose boundaries include Federal lands in the Preserve or contain facilities that milled timber from lands in the Preserve during any portion of the five-year period ending on the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 17) Prohibits the Secretary, in preparing the Preserve budget proposal for each fiscal year, from targeting any of the budget to any commodity production in the Preserve. (Sec. 18) Authorizes appropriations."
