  <summary>10/31/1997--Introduced.
Community Flight Safety Act of 1997 - Prohibits the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from closing any flight service station that: (1) is located in the contiguous United States and within 50 miles from the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, or one of the Great Lakes; and (2) is located in an area that the Administrator determines has weather conditions requiring aircraft to operate under instrument flight rules on an average of 180 days or more per year. Directs the Administrator to reopen any flight service station that was closed after September 1, 1997, and that met the requirements under this Act. Amends Federal aviation law to earmark specified funds under the essential air service program to reopen and operate such stations.</summary>
