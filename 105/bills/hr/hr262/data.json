Allows an assignment of a Federal or State employee for work at Redwood National Park, arranged by the Secretary, or an extension of such assignment to be for any period of time determined by the Secretary and the State to be mutually beneficial. Modifies a reporting requirement to direct the Secretary to submit an annual written report to the Congress by January 31 of each year which describes the contracts and cooperative agreements entered into in the previous year."
