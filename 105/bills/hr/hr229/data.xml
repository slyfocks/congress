  <summary>1/7/1997--Introduced.
Credit Opportunity Amendments Act of 1997 - Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to repeal the requirement that the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency take an institution's record of meeting it's entire community's credit needs into its evaluation of such institution's deposit facility application. Requires each financial institution to prepare a public description of its lending and related programs designed to enhance the availability of community credit, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Fair Housing Act to prohibit: (1) creditor discrimination on the basis of the racial or ethnic characteristics of the applicant's surrounding neighborhood; (2) the Attorney General from initiating a civil enforcement action pursuant to the Consumer Credit Protection Act except upon referral; and (3) the use of statistical data indicating a disparate impact on various classes of applicants of a creditor's credit decisions as evidence of violations of such Act(s) unless accompanied by additional evidence demonstrating actual discrimination and intent to discriminate.</summary>
