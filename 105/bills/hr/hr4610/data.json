Allows any private or public entity to submit a claim for such damages. Directs the Secretary to reimburse a claimant within 90 days unless the Secretary finds that the damages were not caused by such regulations. Provides for the appeal of a rejected claim to the State court in which the claimant is domiciled. Grants a claimant the right to a civil trial by jury in the event the amount in dispute, litigation costs included, is $20,000 or greater."
