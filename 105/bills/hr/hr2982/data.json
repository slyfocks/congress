Directs the Administrator of General Services to: (1) establish and enforce child care health, safety and facility standards; and (2) require child care center compliance with accreditation standards issued by a nationally recognized accreditation organization approved by the Administrator. Prescribes enforcement procedures. Instructs the Architect of the Capitol and the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to promulgate regulations for child care centers in legislative and judicial facilities which are no less stringent than those issued by the Administrator. Confers upon the Architect and the Director child care center duties and authorities comparable to those of the Administrator. Provides for technical assistance, studies, and reviews in order to assist child care center operator compliance with this Act. Instructs the Administrator to establish an interagency council to facilitate cooperation and coordinate policy regarding the provision of child care in the Federal Government. Authorizes appropriations."
