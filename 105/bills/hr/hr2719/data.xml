  <summary>10/23/1997--Introduced.
Child Care Public-Private Partnership Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a business-incentive grant program to provide child care through public-private partnerships. Provides program grants to cover not more than one-third of the costs for: (1) businesses or consortia (two or more businesses acting jointly, which may also include a nonprofit private organization) to start up, or provide additional, employee child care services; and (2) nonprofit business organizations to provide technical information and assistance to enable businesses to provide employee child care services. Sets forth eligibility and application requirements, including: (1) provision of such services equitably and affordably to low- and moderate-income employees; and (2) compliance with State and local licensing requirements. Gives priority in grant selection to business and consortia applicants, especially businesses with fewer than 100 full-time employees. Requires equitable geographic distribution. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
