    "date": "1997-01-07", 
    "text": "New Jersey Marine and Estuarine Ecosystem Protection Act of 1997 - Prohibits the transport of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters at the New York Bight Dredged Material Disposal Site (Mud Dump Site), other than for remediation pursuant to this Act, on and after September 1, 1997. Prohibits, after the date of this Act's enactment, the transport of: (1) dredged material for such purpose, other than Category I or II dredged material; and (2) Category II dredged material for such purpose unless the affected States or ports were requested to provide alternate disposal sites and failed to provide a reasonable alternative site and the dumping at the Mud Dump Site will not increase the elevation of the ocean bottom beyond a certain point. Requires a remediation and restoration plan, designation of the Mud Dump Site and areas that have been used for disposal of contaminated material as the Historic Area Remediation Site, and modification of environmental assessment activities. Prohibits the transport of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in ocean waters in the New York Bight Apex outside the Historic Area Remediation Site, or in waters of the New York-New Jersey Harbor, on and after September 1, 1997. Prohibits designation of any new site for ocean dumping of dredged material within the Apex and issuance of any permit for transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in the Apex, except in accordance with this Act. Prescribes violation penalties. Directs the Secretary of the Army to establish, operate, and maintain a confined dredged material disposal facility or facilities within the Port of New York and New Jersey (Port). Prohibits the Secretary from constructing sediment containment islands in the Port if such construction would result in the loss of shellfish or other fisheries habitat. Requires that, if the Secretary determines that upland disposal of dredged material is necessary in that port, the disposal site be designated within close proximity of the actual dredging site. Authorizes appropriations."
