    "text": "Older Americans Amendments of 1998 - Revises the Older Americans Act of 1965 in toto. (Sec. 3) Retains the Administration on Aging in the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Assistant Secretary for Aging. Changes from mandatory to optional: (1) the Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Programs (renamed the Office on Native Americans); and (2) the Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. Directs the Assistant Secretary to designate individuals with pertinent expertise who shall be responsible for administration of: (1) grants for Native American programs on aging; (2) Federal activities relating to State long-term care ombudsman programs; and (3) nutrition services. Revises the duties of the Assistant Secretary. Repeals the specific mandate for the Assistant Secretary to engage in certain activities with respect to policy alternatives for long-term care. Eliminates the National Center on Elder Abuse, the National Aging Information Center, and the Federal Council on the Aging. Authorizes appropriations. Revises and consolidates programs of grants to Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians for the delivery costs of supportive and nutrition services. Prescribes the distribution of funds among the appropriate organizations. Retains the Secretary of the Interior's authority, acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to make surplus educational facilities available for multipurpose senior centers. Authorizes appropriations. Revises the programs of grants for State and community programs on aging.

Authorizes appropriations for State long-term care ombudsman programs and programs for the prevention and remediation of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Older American Community Service Employment Act of 1998 - Replaces the current authority of the Secretary of Labor to establish an older American community service employment program with a mandate to make competitive grants to States and public and nonprofit private organizations to provide unemployed low-income older individuals, with otherwise poor employment prospects, employment opportunities in providing community services. Revises grant and employment project requirements. Provides for allotments and reservation of funds for such grants. Requires the Secretary of Labor to establish objective performance standards for projects. Authorizes appropriations."
