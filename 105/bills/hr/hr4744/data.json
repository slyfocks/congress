Mandates that any surplus chimpanzee that is not owned by the Federal Government be accepted into the system if the owner transfers title to the chimpanzee to the Federal Government. Provides for standards for permanent retirement of surplus chimpanzees into the system. Requires such standards to authorize the Secretary to authorize imposition of a fee (except in certain circumstances) for accepting a non-Federal chimpanzee into the system. Outlines provisions for the awarding of contracts for operation of the system. Provides for funding."
