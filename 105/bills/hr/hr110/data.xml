Campaign Truth and Fairness Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 with respect to Federal elections to limit the services or payments not included in the definition of "contribution" to only the value of voluntary services on behalf of a candidate or political committee (thus restricting "soft money" contributions). Increases individual contribution limits to a candidate and his or her political committee, and decreases similar multicandidate political committee limits, to $2,500. Limits personal contributions by a candidate for the House of Representatives to $100,000 per campaign cycle.</summary>
