Prohibits the use of funds made available to the Department of State, the United States Information Agency, and the United States Agency for International Development to provide travel expenses for certain Chinese officials participating in international conferences, exchanges, programs, and activities. Requires each agency to certify to appropriate congressional committees that it did not pay such expenses. Makes such officials ineligible to receive visas for admission into the United States. Permits the President to waive such requirement if he determines it vital to the national interest and provides a written justification to the appropriate congressional committees."
