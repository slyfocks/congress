Provides that when the IG grants such approval, he or she retains continuing authority to join the case or investigation, or after consultation with the unit, to replace it as the primary agency assigned to the case or investigation. Provides that overpayments collected by a State Medicaid fraud control unit shall be credited exclusively to, and be available for expenditure under, the Federal health care program that was subject to the activity that was the basis for the collection."
