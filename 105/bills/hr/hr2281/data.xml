TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: WIPO Treaties Implementation Title II: Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Title III: Computer Maintenance or Repair Copyright Exemption Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions Title V: Protection of Certain Original Designs Digital Millennium Copyright Act - Title I: WIPO Treaties Implementation - WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act of 1998 - Amends Federal copyright law to grant copyright protection to: (1) sound recordings that were first fixed in a treaty party (a country or intergovernmental organization other than the United States that is a party to specified international copyright and other agreements); and (2) pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works incorporated in a building or other structure or an architectural work embodied in a building located in the United States or a treaty party. Treats works published in the United States or a treaty party within 30 days after publication in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party as first published in the United States or a treaty party for purposes of conferring protection. Provides that no works other than sound recordings shall be eligible for protection solely by virtue of U.S. adherence to the Geneva Phonograms Convention or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Performances and Phonograms Treaty. Revises the definition of "eligible country," for purposes of provisions regarding copyright in restored works, to include nations other than the United States that: (1) become World Trade Organization member countries after the date of enactment of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; (2) are or become nations adhering to the Berne Convention; (3) adhere to the WIPO Copyright or Performances and Phonograms Treaties; or (4) become subject to a certain presidential proclamation of copyright restoration after such enactment date. Includes sound recordings in the definition of "restored work" if the source country for the work is an eligible country solely by its adherence to the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. (Sec. 103) Prohibits: (1) circumvention of technological measures that control access to protected works; or (2) manufacturing or trafficking in technology designed to circumvent measures that control access to, or protect rights of copyright owners in, such works. Makes the prohibition effective at the end of the two-year period beginning on the enactment of this Act. Exempts persons who are users of a copyrighted work which is in a particular class if such persons are, or are likely to be in the succeeding three-year period, adversely affected by virtue of such prohibition in their ability to make noninfringing uses of that particular class of works. Requires, during the two-year period and during each succeeding three-year period, the Librarian of Congress, upon the recommendation of the Register of Copyrights, to make the determination in a rulemaking proceeding on the record of whether the individuals who are users of copyrighted work are adversely affected in their ability to make noninfringing uses of a particular class of copyrighted works. Requires the Librarian to publish any class of copyrighted works for which the Librarian determines, pursuant to the rulemaking procedure, that noninfringing uses by persons who are users of copyrighted work are, or are likely to be, adversely affected and that the prohibition is inapplicable to such users with respect to such class of works for the ensuring three-year period. Prohibits an exception from the applicability of the prohibition or any determination made in such rule making from being used as a defense in any action to enforce any provision of this title. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall enlarge or diminish any rights of free speech or the press for activities using consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing products. Provides exemptions to such prohibition for: (1) nonprofit libraries, archives, or educational institutions which gain access to a commercially exploited copyrighted work solely to make a good faith determination of whether to acquire such work, subject to certain conditions; (2) lawfully authorized investigative, protective, information security, or intelligence activities of the United States, a State, or political subdivision of a State; and (3) purposes of achieving interoperability of computer programs. Defines "information security" as activities carried out in order to identify and address the vulnerabilities of a government computer, computer system, or computer network. Specifies: (1) conditions under which a person is allowed to circumvent technological measures as applied to a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a published work in the course of an act of good faith encryption research and the use of technological means for such encryption research activities; and (2) factors to be considered in determining whether the person qualifies for such exemption. Defines "encryption research" as activities necessary to identify and analyze flaws and vulnerabilities of encryption technologies applied to copyrighted works, if these activities are conducted to advance the state of knowledge in the field of encryption technology or to assist in the development of encryption products. Requires the Register of Copyrights and the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce to jointly report to the Congress, along with legislative recommendations, if any, on the effect this Act has had on: (1) encryption research and the development of encryption technology; (2) the adequacy and effectiveness of technological measures designed to protect copyrighted works; and (3) protection of copyright owners against the unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted works. Permits the court, in applying this Act to a component or part, to consider the necessity for its intended and actual incorporation in a technology, product, service, or device which: (1) does not itself violate the provisions of this title; and (2) has the sole purpose to prevent the access of minors to material on the Internet. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) protection of personally identifying information; (2) inapplicability to certain technological measures; (3) permissible acts of security testing and factors in determining an exemption for such testing; and (4) use of technological means for security testing.
