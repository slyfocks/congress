  <summary>6/12/1997--Introduced.
Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from continuing or beginning to conduct an enforcement action against a de minimis party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund) that: (1) did not cause the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance; and (2) had no knowledge of the release or threat of release until after it occurred. Requires certain time limitations on the filing of actions for natural resource damages, cost recovery, or contributions to be tolled with respect to such enforcement actions for the period during which the moratorium under this Act is in effect.</summary>
