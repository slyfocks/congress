  <summary>06/12/1997--Introduced.
Frequent Flyer Act of 1997 - Amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to require that travel awards accrued by reason of official travel by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate or the House of Representatives (current law applies to only the Senate) be used only for official travel or travel by a Member of Congress or his or her family member between the Washington, D.C. area and the Member's State. Allows a Member of Congress to transfer such travel awards to a nonprofit tax-exempt organization. Expresses the sense of the Congress that commercial airlines should provide that travel awards are transferable in a manner consistent with this Act.</summary>
