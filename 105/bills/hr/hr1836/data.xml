  <summary>9/30/1998--Passed Senate amended.
Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 - Amends Federal law concerning Government organization and employees to revise provisions regarding the debarment of any health care provider found to have engaged in fraudulent practices, including requiring (currently, permitting) debarment for certain fraudulent practices. (Sec. 3) Makes amendments relating to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) which: (1) modify the definition of a carrier; (2) specify that the Government-wide service plan may be underwritten by participating affiliates licensed in each State; and (3) revise preemption provisions. (Sec. 4) Extends FEHBP coverage to certain employees of the: (1) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and (2) Federal Reserve Board. (Sec. 5) Requires the Office of Personnel Management to encourage carriers that enter into contractual arrangements made with any person to obtain discounts from providers for health care services or supplies to seek assurance that the conditions for such discounts are fully disclosed to the providers who grant them. (Sec. 6) Amends Federal law to set forth provisions for: (1) the readmission of certain plans that have discontinued their participation in FEHBP; and (2) the treatment of the contingency reserves of such discontinued plans. (Sec. 7) Increases the maximum annual comparability allowance payable under a service agreement to a Government physician who has served as such a physician for more than 24 months. Allows for the modification of existing service agreements based on the increase with respect to any period of service remaining in such agreements. (Sec. 8) Permits a health benefits plan to provide direct access or direct payment or reimbursement to specified licensed health care providers.</summary>
