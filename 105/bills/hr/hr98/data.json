    "text": "Consumer Internet Privacy Protection Act of 1997 - Prohibits an interactive computer service from disclosing to a third party any personally identifiable information provided by a subscriber without the subscriber's informed written consent. Permits the subscriber to revoke such consent at any time and requires the service to cease disclosing such information. Prohibits such service or its employee from knowingly disclosing to a third party any personally identifiable information provided by a subscriber that such service has knowingly falsified. Requires, at a subscriber's request, such service to: (1) provide such individual with his or her personally identifiable information maintained by the service; (2) permit the subscriber to verify and to correct such information; and (3) provide to the subscriber the identity of the third party recipients of such information. Prohibits the service from charging a fee to the subscriber for making such information available. Grants the Federal Trade Commission the authority to: (1) investigate whether a service has been or is engaged in any act or practice prohibited by this Act; and (2) if so, issue a cease and desist order as if such service were in violation of specified provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Allows a subscriber aggrieved by a violation of this Act to obtain appropriate relief in a civil action."
