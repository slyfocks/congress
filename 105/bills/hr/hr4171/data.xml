  <summary>6/25/1998--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Transportation to study and report to the Congress on options for improving the safety of persons at roadside emergency scenes, including motor vehicle accident scenes. Expresses the sense of the Congress that States should enforce laws to improve the safety of persons present at such places, thus making it unnecessary for the Congress to enact Federal legislation to withhold Federal highway funds until such State laws are enacted and enforced.</summary>
