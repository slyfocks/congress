Amends Federal law relating to health care services for veterans to include the services under this Act in the definition of \"medical services.\" Regulates provision of the preventive services on an outpatient basis.

Amends Federal law relating to medical care for dependents of members of the uniformed services to add coverage of the preventive services. Mandates: (1) grants to counties for a project to demonstrate the effectiveness of providing those services to improve and reduce health costs; (2) dissemination of information on the benefits of practicing preventive care; (3) grants to employers to establish and conduct on-site workshops on health care promotion for employees; and (4) a program of on-site workshops on health care promotion for Federal employees."
