Part B: General Provisions - Set forth provisions concerning, among other things: (1) fee amounts and availability; (2) assessment, publication, and reduction or waiver of fees; and (3) with respect to such fees, the FDA agency plan and reporting requirements. Title II: Medicare Administrative Fees - Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to impose, to the extent provided in appropriations Acts, fees for initial Medicare+Choice contracts and annual fees for renewal of such contracts and monitoring of the ongoing operations of Medicare+Choice organizations. (Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to establish fee amounts annually, which shall not exceed reasonably estimated costs. Allows the Secretary to provide for reduction or waiver of such fees in exceptional circumstances in the public interest. Requires such fees to be credited to the Health Care Financing Administration Program Management Account. (Sec. 202) Amends SSA title XVIII part D (Miscellaneous Provisions) to repeal the prohibition against the imposition of fees for conducting certification surveys. Requires imposition of such fees, except upon entities subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1998. Prohibits an entity from including such a fee as an allowable item on a cost report under SSA title XVIII or XIX (Medicaid). (Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary to establish a procedure for initial and periodic renewal of registration of individuals and entities that furnish items or services for which Medicare payment may be made and that are not otherwise subject to Medicare provisions for such procedures. Requires the Secretary, to the extent provided in appropriations Acts, to impose: (1) fees for initial agreements with service providers, and initial registrations of other entities and individuals that furnish items or services for which Medicare payment may be made; and (2) annual fees to cover the costs of renewals of agreements and registrations of such individuals and entities. Sets forth fee- related assessment limitations, crediting requirements, and cost- reporting restrictions similar to those for the other fees required by this title. (Sec. 204) Outlines requirements for new mandatory fees for review, audit, and cost settlement activities under the Medicare Integrity Program, to be credited to the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. (Sec. 205) Subjects certain claims to a $1 processing fee, including claims which duplicate another claim submitted by the same individual or entity, and claims which are not submitted electronically. Allows the waiver of fees in the latter case where compelling circumstances exist. Sets forth guidelines for the collection, crediting, and availability of such fees similar to the guidelines for initial Medicare+Choice contract and renewal fees. Title III: Miscellaneous User Fees - Amends the Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to collect fees to cover costs of providing services under specified agricultural laws. (Sec. 302) Requires the Secretary of Commerce to collect fees for the provision of navigation assistance and fisheries management and enforcement services. Limits a fisheries management fee to one percent of the ex-vessel value of harvested fish with respect to which the fee is collected. (Sec. 304) Amends Federal law to increase patent fees (including maintenance fees), except fees for the filing of provisional applications for original patents.
