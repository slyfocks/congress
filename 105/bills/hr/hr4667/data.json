Treats violations as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. (Sec. 102) Requires that the regulations provide incentives for self-regulation, including deeming compliance if a person applies guidelines issued by computer industry representatives and approved by the Federal Trade Commission. Title II: Examinations of Internet Privacy Protections for Adults - Directs the Commission to report to the Congress and make related rule changes regarding: (1) whether consumers are able and, if not, how consumers may be enabled, to know that information is being collected about them through their use of telecommunications systems and to exercise control over the collection, use, reuse, disclosure, or sale of the information; (2) the impact of interconnected communications technologies on consumer privacy rights and remedies."
