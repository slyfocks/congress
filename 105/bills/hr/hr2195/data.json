Directs the Commissioner of Customs to report to the Congress on products made with forced labor that are destined for the U.S. market. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should: (1) determine whether any country with which the United States has a memorandum of understanding on reciprocal trade involving goods made with forced labor is frustrating implementation of such memorandum; and (2) immediately commence negotiations, in the event of an affirmative determination, to replace the current memorandum with one providing for effective procedures for the monitoring of forced labor, including improved procedures to request investigations of suspected prison labor facilities by international monitors."
