Applies such block grant options to all funds appropriated for the Department of Education for FY 2000 or any succeeding fiscal year to carry out programs or activities under: (1) the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (other than titles I and X); (2) the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (other than titles VIII, IX, and XIV); (3) the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994; and (4) the Carl D.
