(Sec. 3) Directs the Commission to require each political committee filing a report to include with the report a filing fee when the amount of contributions, expenditures, or disbursements covered by the report exceeds a threshold established by the Commission. Revises the standard for referral of certain violations to the Attorney General. Requires the Commission to conduct random audits of the reports of political committees. (Sec. 4) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for reduced broadcast media rates for candidates. (Sec. 5) Amends FECA to set forth restrictions on the use of non-Federal funds. (Sec. 6) Revises requirements for the composition of the Commission and terms of Commissioners and replaces them with new requirements, including one that Commissioners serve no more than a single term."
