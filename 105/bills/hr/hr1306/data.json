    "text": "Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to declare that: (1) the laws of a host State (including laws on community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, and establishment of intrastate branches) shall apply to any out-of-State bank branch in that State to the same extent as such laws apply to a branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank; and (2) an insured State bank that establishes a branch in a host State may conduct any activity permissible under the laws of its home State if such activity is permissible for a bank chartered by the host State, or for a branch in the host State of an out-of-State national bank. States that, to the extent host State law does not apply to an out-of-State bank branch, the home State law shall apply. Precludes construction of this Act as affecting the applicability of: (1) any State law of any home State under certain statutory guidelines governing FDIA approval of authorized interstate merger transactions; or (2) Federal law to State banks and State bank branches in either the home State or the host State. Amends the Revised Statutes to require the Comptroller of the Currency to review the actions it has taken during the preceding year regarding the applicability of State law to national banks, and include review results in its annual report. Requires the first review to encompass all such actions taken on or before January 1, 1992. Declares that this Act does not alter the right of States to opt out of certain interest rate requirements of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980."
