Revises requirements, with respect to Indian children, regarding: (1) the voluntary termination of parental rights; and (2) the withdrawal of a consent to such voluntary termination or to adoption. Requires a party seeking the voluntary placement of an Indian child or the voluntary termination of parental rights to provide written notice to the Indian child's tribe. Sets forth the requirements for such a written notice. Permits an Indian tribe to intervene only if a child's tribe has filed a written objection, but permits the child's Indian tribe to intervene in any case in which the Indian tribe did not receive a written notice. Provides criminal sanctions for fraudulent representation with respect to any proceeding involving an Indian child."
