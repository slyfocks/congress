Requires the Secretary to review reported information to determine trends relating to drugs and to report to the compiler of the official compendia for consideration of revisions of packaging and labeling requirements or other standards for drugs for dissemination to health professionals. Imposes fines for reporting to or requesting information from the data bank unlawfully. Prescribes penalties for failing to make required reports. Amends the Social Security Act to exclude any individual or entity for noncompliance with this Act."
