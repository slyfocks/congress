Safe Medications Act of 1997 - Requires any health care facility in which an error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a drug results in an individual's death, to report such error and resulting death to a data bank to be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Requires the Secretary to review reported information to determine trends relating to drugs and to report to the compiler of the official compendia for consideration of revisions of packaging and labeling requirements or other standards for drugs for dissemination to health professionals. Imposes fines for reporting to or requesting information from the data bank unlawfully. Prescribes penalties for failing to make required reports. Amends the Social Security Act to exclude any individual or entity for noncompliance with this Act.</summary>
