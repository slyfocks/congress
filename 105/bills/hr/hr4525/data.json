Requires the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) upon application by the city of Portland, Oregon, to enter into negotiations with the city for the transfer of National Forest System land underlying the city's Bull Run water supply facilities to the city in exchange for city- owned land lying within the boundaries of any unit of the National Forest System in Oregon or Washington; and (2) to expedite the negotiations and complete such land exchange not later than September 30, 2001."
