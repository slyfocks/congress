States that such visa shall expire when the child reaches the age of 18, unless at the request of the parent a regular visa with fee is issued. Amends the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 to revise the border crossing restriction implementation schedule. Requires tourist and business visitor visas to continue to be processed at least until October 1, 2003, in the Mexican border cities of Nogales, Nuevo Laredo, Ciudad Acuna, Piedras Negras, Agua Prieta, and Reynosa."
