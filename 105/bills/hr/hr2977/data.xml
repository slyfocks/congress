Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 - Amends the Federal Advisory Committee Act to redefine the term "advisory committee" to exclude any committee that is created by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration. Makes such amendment retroactive to October 6, 1972. Prohibits Federal agency use of any advice or recommendation provided by the National Academy of Sciences or the National Academy of Public Administration that was developed by use of a committee created by that academy under an agreement with an agency except under specified conditions. Sets forth public disclosure requirements for such academies. Requires the Administrator of General Services to report to the Congress on the implementation of and compliance with the amendments made by this Act.</summary>
