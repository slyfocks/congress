  <summary>4/24/1997--Introduced.
Clean Water Enforcement and Compliance Improvement Act of 1997 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require any person subject to the requirements of the Act (currently, owners or operators of point sources) to maintain records, make reports, and allow access to information to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to carrying out such Act. Directs States to post signs containing information concerning water quality and environmental and health effects at each major point of public access to a body of navigable water that does not meet an applicable water quality standard or that is subject to a fishing ban or consumption restriction due to fish or shellfish contamination. Requires permits issued for discharges to navigable waters (except those issued to municipalities for discharges composed entirely of stormwater) to ensure compliance with public information requirements concerning the discharge and location of discharges of pollutants by the permittee. Provides for the issuance of compliance orders and the imposition of civil, criminal, or administrative penalties for violations of requirements of pretreatment programs. Repeals a provision that treats a single operational upset that leads to simultaneous violations of more than one pollution parameter as a single violation. Raises the ceiling on the amount of administrative penalties allowed to be assessed for violations. Removes provisions that permit State enforcement actions to serve as a bar to Federal enforcement actions. Directs the EPA Administrator to: (1) conduct inspections of facilities operated by significant noncompliers at which violations occurred; and (2) report annually to the Congress and to State Governors on persons classified as significant noncompliers. Requires State pollutant discharge permit programs to include specified inspection, monitoring, and reporting requirements. Prohibits the issuance of permits to significant noncompliers until conditions giving rise to violations have been corrected. Authorizes the Administrator to renew expired State discharge permits under certain conditions. Authorizes citizen suits for past violations of effluent standards or limitations if there is evidence that the alleged violations have been repeated. Amends employee protection provisions of the Act, including a prohibition against any employer or other person harassing, prosecuting, holding liable, or discriminating against any employee or other person for: (1) assisting in achieving compliance with the Act; (2) refusing to violate or assist in the violation of the Act; and (3) commencing a proceeding, testifying at a proceeding, or assisting or participating in such a proceeding or in any other action to carry out the purposes of the Act. Establishes the Clean Water Trust Fund. Requires the Administrator to use Fund moneys to carry out inspections and enforcement activities. Makes specified provisions of this Act applicable to cases pending on this Act's enactment date.</summary>
