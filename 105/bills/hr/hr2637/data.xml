  <summary>10/8/1997--Introduced.
United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to place into circulation $1 coins depicting the Statue of Liberty upon depletion of the Government's supply of $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony. Amends Federal law to mandate that the dollar coin shall: (1) be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, with tactile and visual features making it readily discernible; (2) be minted and fabricated in the United States; and (3) have similar metallic anticounterfeiting properties as U.S. clad coinage in circulation on the date of enactment of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to continue to mint and issue $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony if the supply of such coins is depleted before production of the coins depicting the Statue of Liberty has begun.</summary>
