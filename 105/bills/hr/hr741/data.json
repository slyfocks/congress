Prohibits persons from taking migratory birds by the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where they know or should have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that bait was present. (Sec. 4) Requires all fines and penalties assessed and recovered under this Act to be deposited into the migratory bird conservation fund. (Sec. 5) Amends penalty provisions of such Act to provide that in lieu of seizing any personal property used in violating such Act (except for restricted machine guns and shotguns), the Secretary shall permit the owner or operator of such property to post bond or other surety pending the disposition of any proceeding under the Act."
