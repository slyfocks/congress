Includes within such guidelines: (1) SEC consideration of investor protection, and the promotion of efficiency, competition, and capital formation; (2) SEC consultation with Federal banking agencies; (3) a public file of the record engendered by a proposed accounting principle; and (4) the availability of judicial review."
