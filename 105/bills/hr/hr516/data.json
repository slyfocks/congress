    "date": "1997-02-04", 
    "text": "Youth Smoking Prevention Act of 1997 - Declares that the Secretary of Health and Human Services does not have any authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, or the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 to regulate the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, and advertising and promotion of tobacco and other tobacco products containing nicotine. Establishes the Federal authority to regulate the sale, distribution, and advertising and promotion of tobacco and tobacco products containing nicotine as a condition to the receipt by a State of the Federal preventive health and health services block grant. Amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit or reduce the amount of block grants for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse based on whether a State has a law prohibiting: (1) sale of tobacco or tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18; (2) purchase of those materials by such individuals; (3) use of false identification for the purchase of those materials; (4) sale of individual cigarettes and packages of fewer than 20 cigarettes; (5) operation of a vending machine dispensing such materials unless specified requirements are met; (6) use of unsupervised self-service displays; (7) distribution of free samples to such individuals; and (8) distribution through the mail to such individuals. Sets forth general requirements regarding the sale of such materials and related notice by the owner to the employees of a retail establishment. Prohibits engaging in the retail sale of cigarettes without a license issued by the State. Sets forth State responsibilities. Regulates billboard advertising. Prohibits the placement of a tobacco manufacturer's brand name or logo on any item marketed specifically to minors, including toys and video games. Allows use of amounts available under such block grants to enforce the laws described in this Act."
