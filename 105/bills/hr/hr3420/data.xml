Department of Justice Vacancies Clarification Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that: (1) nothing in current provisions governing the Attorney General authorizes the appointment or designation of a person to perform the functions of an office in the Department of Justice (DOJ), appointment to which requires the advice and consent of the Senate, while that office is vacant; (2) if the power of a person appointed or designated under specified provisions to perform functions while an office is vacant lapses, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit shall appoint a person to continue performing those functions until the vacancy is filled; and (3) the Court shall not appoint to such office a person who has been nominated by the President but not confirmed by the Senate or who was previously appointed or designated for that vacancy and whose power to perform such functions has lapsed.</summary>
