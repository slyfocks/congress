Declares that the requirements of specified PHSA provisions do not apply to information provided under this paragraph. (Sec. 110) Declares that, if the Secretary determines that data from one clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence (obtained before or after the investigation) are sufficient to establish effectiveness, the Secretary may consider that data and evidence to constitute substantial evidence. Amends the PHSA to mandate development of guidance on the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials. (Sec. 111) Amends the FDCA to regulate new drug manufacturing changes, including requiring manufacturer validation of the effects of the change and setting forth separate requirements for major and non-major changes.
