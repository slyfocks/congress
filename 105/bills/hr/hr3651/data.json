Replaces the current reasonable cost limit under the system (105 percent of the median of per visit costs of freestanding home health agencies) with: (1) 110 percent of the mean of such costs (during FY 1998); and (2) 107 percent of such mean (for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1998). Repeals the two-year freeze on payment increases for such services. Revises the formula for the per beneficiary annual limitation. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish, according to a specified formula, a per beneficiary efficiency standard for services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997. Repeals the default reduction of interim limits."
