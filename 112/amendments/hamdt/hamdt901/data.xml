  <description>Amendment sought to clarify that nothing in the bill precludes the EPA Administrator from enforcing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 and sought to delete section 3, which would allow the EPA to regulate "nuisance dust" in areas where states and localities do not do so if it substantially hurts public health and if the benefits of applying standards would outweigh the costs.</description>
