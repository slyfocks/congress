  <description>Amendment requires the EPA to take agriculture jobs and the economic impact on the agriculture industry into account before they issue any new regulations relating to agriculture. If a proposed regulation was found to cause the loss of more than 100 agriculturally related jobs or a decrease in more than $1,000,000 in agriculturally related economic activity then EPA would have to give notice to the State's Congressional Delegation, Governor, and Legislature and also hold a public hearing in the impacted State.</description>
