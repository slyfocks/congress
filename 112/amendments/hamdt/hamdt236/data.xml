  <description>Amendment sought to allow the Bob Hope and Van Nuys Airports in southern California to adopt curfews from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. in order to alleviate air traffic noise for residents of the San Fernando Valley.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 29 printed in House Report 112-46 to allow Bob Hope and Van Nuys Airports in southern California to adopt curfews from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., alleviating air traffic noise for residents of the San Fernando Valley. It simplifies the process for these airports to implement a curfew by allowing airports that already had at least a partial curfew in effect before the 1990 Airport Noise and Capacity Act (PL 101-58) to implement mandatory nighttime curfews.</purpose>
