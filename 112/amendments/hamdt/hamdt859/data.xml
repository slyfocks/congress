  <description>An amendment numbered 5 printed in House Report 112-267 to strike section 303 of the bill which places unneeded and harmful restrictions on the future contracting and construction of the United States Coast Guard National Security Cutter. The National Security Cutter is a much needed and extremely cost effective ship for the Coast Guard and is actively proving its value through highly successful counter drug and other missions while replacing a aging coast guard fleet.</description>
