  <description>Amendment exempts Hawaii's large and medium hub airports from collecting PFCs from interisland travelers and ensures that Hawaii's airports would still be subject to the same 75% reduction as any other airport charging a PFC but would take into account the percentage of passengers traveling interisland.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 4 printed in House Report 112-46 to exempt Hawaii's large and medium hub airports from collecting PFCs from interisland travelers due to the unique everyday travel circumstances the island state presents. Would also change the formula under which Hawaii's annual federal apportionments are reduced when the State's large and medium hub airports collect passenger facility charges from overseas travelers.</purpose>
