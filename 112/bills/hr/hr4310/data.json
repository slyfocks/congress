Title II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2013 for DOD for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), in amounts specified in the funding table. Subtitle B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - (Sec. 211) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to ensure that the next-generation long-range strike bomber is: (1) capable of carrying strategic nuclear weapons upon achieving initial operating capability, and (2) certified to use such weapons within two years after achieving such capability. (Sec. 212) Requires the Secretary of the Navy to: (1) conduct additional technology development risk reduction activities using the unmanned combat air system, and (2) preserve a competitive acquisition environment for the Unmanned Carrier-launched Surveillance and Strike system program.

Prohibits: (1) the Secretary of the Navy from reducing to one the number of prime contractors for the technology development phase of such program prior to the program achieving the critical design review milestone, and (2) such program from achieving such milestone until on or after October 1, 2016. (Sec. 214) Prohibits any FY2013 Air Force RDT&E funds from being obligated or expended to initiate a new start acquisition program to provide the Air Force with a manned ground or dismount moving target indicator capability until 90 days after the Secretary of the Air Force reports to the defense and appropriations committees on the plan for such capabilities. Authorizes such Secretary to waive the funding prohibition after notifying such committees that the waiver is required to meet an urgent operational need or other emergency requirement directly related to combat operations. (Sec. 215) Prohibits any FY2013 Army RDT&E funds from being obligated or expended for Milestone A activities with respect to the MQ-18 medium-range multipurpose vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial aircraft system until: (1) the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council certifies to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees as to the system's capabilities; and (2) at least 30 days have elapsed following such certification. (Sec. 216) Authorizes the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (Under Secretary) to use specified FY2013 joint capability technology demonstration funds to carry out a program to develop and flight-demonstrate vertical lift platform technologies that address capability gaps described in DOD's Future Vertical Lift Strategic Plan. Outlines program goals and objectives. Subtitle C: Missile Defense Programs - (Sec. 221) Directs the Secretary to: (1) procure two AN/TPY-2 radars, and (2) report to the defense and appropriations committees on the feasibility of developing one such radar on a rotational table to allow it to quickly change directions.

Directs the Administrator to ensure that the federal subcontracting reporting system to which such reports are submitted is modified to notify the Administrator, the appropriate contracting officer, and the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization if an entity fails to submit a required report. Makes such failure a breach of contract for which appropriate action may be taken.

Part VI: Contract Bundling - (Sec. 1671) Consolidates SBA provisions relating to contract bundling (the consolidation of two or more procurement requirements into a solicitation for a single prime contract that is unlikely, because of its size or complexity, to be suitable for award to a small business).

Requires the Administrator, in the case of a previously bundled contract that is to be recompeted as a bundled contract, to determine, among other things, the amount of savings and benefits achieved under the bundling. Requires a procurement center representative who believes that a procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely to recommend to the Activity alternative procurement methods to increase small business contracting opportunities. Requires the head of an agency, before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a bundling of contract requirements, to conduct market research to determine whether bundling is necessary and justified. Prohibits an agency head from carrying out an acquisition strategy that includes bundled contracts valued in excess of certain thresholds unless the senior procurement executive for such agency certifies to the agency head that steps will be taken to include small businesses in the acquisition strategy prior to its implementation. Allows a small business, in the case of a bundled contract, to submit an offer that provides for the use of a team of subcontractors for contract performance.
