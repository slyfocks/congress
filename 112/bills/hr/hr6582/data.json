    "text": "American Energy Manufacturing Technical Corrections Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to exempt a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer component manufactured on or after January 1, 2009, from the requirement that it contain wall, ceiling, and door insulation of at least R-25 for coolers and R-32 for freezers, if the manufacturer has demonstrated to the Secretary of Energy (DOE) that such component reduces energy consumption at least as much as if such requirement were to apply. Requires the Secretary to publish a rule that establishes a uniform efficiency descriptor and accompanying test methods for covered water heaters (water heaters, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired water storage tanks). Declares that the purpose of such rule is to replace with a uniform efficiency descriptor: (1) the energy factor descriptor for water heaters established under such Act; and (2) the thermal efficiency and standby loss descriptors for storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired water storage tanks established under such rule. Requires the efficiency standard for covered water heaters to be denominated according to the efficiency descriptor established by such rule. Requires the Secretary to develop a mathematical conversion factor for converting the measurement of efficiency for such heaters from the test procedures in effect on this Act's enactment to the new energy descriptor established under this Act. Considers a covered water heater to be in compliance with such rule and with any revised labeling requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to implement such rule if the covered water heater: (1) was manufactured prior to the effective date of the rule, and (2) complied with the efficiency standards and labeling requirements in effect prior to the rule. Establishes energy efficiency standards for: (1) daily energy consumption of service over the counter, self-contained, medium temperature commercial refrigerators; and (2) through-the-wall central air conditioners, through-the-wall central air conditioning heat pumps, and small duct, high velocity systems. Requires the Secretary to: (1) provide notice on whether energy efficiency standards for specified commercial heating and cooling equipment will be amended every six years, (2) evaluate each class of such equipment, (3) provide notice of a decision to grant or deny a petition to amend energy conservation standards, and (4) publish a rule that contains new or amended energy conservation standards every three years."
