  <description>Amendment originally sought to transfer $135 million within the ballistic missile defense account with $65 million being provided for production of 24 additional PAC-3 missiles, and $70 million being provided for manufacturing and development of the Arrow missile; and would have provided for specified reductions in certain accounts. \   As amended by the Hunter substitute amendment (A007), the above was replaced with language that allocates additional funding of $65 million for 24 additional PAC-3 missiles and additional funding of $70 million for the Israeli Arrow Ballistic Missile System program with reductions in funding to come from amounts available to the Missile Defense Agency.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 5 printed in part A of House Report 107-450 to add funding for two programs needed to meet here-and-now threats and $65 million for PAC-3 and $70 million for the Israeli Arrow system to be offset by cutting three BMD programs.</purpose>
