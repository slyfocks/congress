  <description>Amendment increases contribution limits for House candidates in response to personal expenditures by wealthy opponents.</description>
  <purpose>Amendment numbered 10 printed in the Congressions Record February 12, 2002 to triple hard money contribution limits and allow additional coordinated expenditures for House candidates facing wealthy self-financed opponents. The adjusted limits would be triggered when the wealthy opponent has spent more than $350,000 of personal wealth, taking into account as offsets both the personal wealth spent by the non-wealthy candidate and the accumulated campaign funds of both candidates.</purpose>
