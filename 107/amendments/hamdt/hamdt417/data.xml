  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute prohibits officeholders and candidates from soliciting soft money in connection with federal elections and prevents national and state parties from spending soft money on federal election activities; allows capped soft money contributions to state and local parties to be used for limited, non-federal voter registration and get-out-the-vote activity; and prohibits the use of corporate and union treasury funds for broadcast communications that mention a federal candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election.</description>
