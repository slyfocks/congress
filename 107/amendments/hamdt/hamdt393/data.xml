  <description>An amendment to require the federal government to make up the difference in pay for federal employees called into active duty in the Reserves or National Guard since Sept. 11. The amendment also allows those persons with lengthy deployments to keep their and their families' federal health insurance benefits, rather than have to enter the military health care system.</description>
