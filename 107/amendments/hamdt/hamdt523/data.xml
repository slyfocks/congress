  <description>Amendment sought to remove the 2-percent cap on the number of pilots who may be deputized as Federal flight deck officers and requires the Transportation Security Administration to train 20 percent of all pilots who volunteer for the program within 6 months of enactment and train 80 percent by the end of the 2-year pilot program.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 8 printed in the Congressional Record to strike language in the bill providing that the maximum number of pilots that may be deputized as Federal flight deck officers may not exceed 2 percent of the total number of pilots that are employed by air carriers engaged in air transportation or intrastate transportation on the date of enactment of the bill and to insert new requirements stating that not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of the bill, 20 percent of all pilots who volunteer to participate in the program within 30 days of such date of enactment shall be trained and deputized as Federal flight deck officers. The amendment also specifies that within a 2-year period of the pilot program, 80 percent of all pilots who volunteer to participate in the program must be trained and deputized as Federal flight deck officers.</purpose>
