  "purpose": "An amendment to provide $2.2 trillion in tax relief between 2002 and 2011 and an additional $93 billion in tax relief for the current fiscal year; to set defense spending at $350 billion in FY 2002; to spend $6.7 billion less in FY 2002 on discretionary programs than proposed by the Committee and $150 billion less over 10 years for discretionary programs. The amendment also locks away 100% of the Social Security and Medicare surpluses; requires that any prescription drug benefit be a part of an overall Medicare reform package that does not weaken the long-term solvency of the system by increased baseline spending; provides specific protection for Social Security reform legislation; ensures that the impact of a proposed tax measure on the economy and federal revenues is taken into account and ensures that \"triggers\" are not added to any tax measure.",
