Consumer Technology Bill of Rights - Expresses the sense of Congress that, with respect to all electronic media in U.S. commerce, consumers who legally acquire copyrighted and non-copyrighted works should be free to use these works in non-commercial ways. Lists the following rights of consumers in legally acquired copyrighted and non-copyrighted works: (1) the right to record legally acquired video or audio for later viewing or listening (popularly referred to as "time-shifting"); (2) the right to use legally acquired content in different places (popularly referred to as "space-shifting"); (3) the right to archive or make backup copies of legally acquired content for use in the event that the original copies are destroyed; (4) the right to use legally acquired content on the electronic platform or device of the consumer's choice; (5) the right to translate legally acquired content into comparable formats; and (6) the right to use technology in order to achieve such enumerated rights.</summary>
