Lists the following rights of consumers in legally acquired copyrighted and non-copyrighted works: (1) the right to record legally acquired video or audio for later viewing or listening (popularly referred to as \"time-shifting\"); (2) the right to use legally acquired content in different places (popularly referred to as \"space-shifting\"); (3) the right to archive or make backup copies of legally acquired content for use in the event that the original copies are destroyed; (4) the right to use legally acquired content on the electronic platform or device of the consumer's choice; (5) the right to translate legally acquired content into comparable formats; and (6) the right to use technology in order to achieve such enumerated rights."
