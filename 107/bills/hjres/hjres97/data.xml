  <summary>6/11/2002--Introduced.
Calls upon the President of the United States and the Government of Russia to fulfill their commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to work with the other nuclear powers toward eliminating nuclear weapons in stages that are subjected to careful inspection and verification.Calls for the United States to: (1) renounce the first use of nuclear weapons and permanently end the development, testing, and production of nuclear weapons; (2) seek an agreement with Russia that provides for the mutual and verified destruction of nuclear weapons that are withdrawn under signed treaties and that increases resources to secure and implement the destruction of nuclear warheads and material; (3) strengthen non-proliferation efforts by ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, by refraining from providing nuclear reactor technologies that can be exploited for nuclear weapons purposes to North Korea and urging Russia to refrain from providing such technologies to Iran, by supporting United Nations inspections of suspected nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear weapons materials in Iraq, and by participating in locating and reducing fissile material worldwide and negotiating a ban on its production; (4) enter into an agreement with the other nuclear powers to take nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert, thereby reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized use and preparing for the ultimate elimination of the warheads; and (5) initiate talks on further reductions of nuclear weapons.</summary>
