  <summary>12/20/2001--Passed House amended.
Declares that: (1) the United States and the United Nations (UN) Security Council should insist on a complete program of inspection and monitoring to prevent the development of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; (2) Iraq should allow UN weapons inspectors access to areas, facilities, equipment, records, and means of transportation as required by UN Security Resolutions 707 and 1284; (3) the United States should ensure that the UN does not accept any inspection and monitoring regime that fails to guarantee such access; (4) Iraq, as a result of its refusal to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 687 and subsequent relevant resolutions, remains in breach of its international obligations; and (5) Iraq's refusal to allow UN weapons inspectors access to covered facilities and documents presents a mounting threat to the United States, its friends and allies, and international peace and security.</summary>
