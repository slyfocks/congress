Requires, before such authority may be exercised: (1) the President to make available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination that the United States has attempted to seek, and the Security Council has adopted after September 12, 2002, a resolution authorizing such action to enforce Resolution 687 or that the threat to the United States or allied nations posed by those programs is so grave that the use of force is necessary, notwithstanding the Security Council's failure to approve the resolution; and (2) Congress to approve the President's determination in a joint resolution.Requires the President to keep Congress fully and currently informed on matters relevant to this Act.Declares that this Act is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization for use of the armed forces, consistent with requirements of the War Powers Resolution."
