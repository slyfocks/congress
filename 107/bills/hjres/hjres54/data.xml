  <summary>6/21/2001--Introduced.
Students' Rights Resolution of 2001 - Declares that Congress recognizes: (1) the right, as established by the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court, of all Americans to freely exercise their religion; (2) the constitutional right of students in public schools to participate in a daily period of time to be used for silent prayer, meditation, or reflection and to recite the Pledge of Allegiance; and (3) the right of religious groups to have equal access to school facilities without discrimination on account of religious character or speech.Expresses the sense of Congress that public schools should act to protect these constitutional rights by establishing a period of time for silent prayer, meditation, or reflection, establishing a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and accommodating religious groups by granting equal access rather than discriminating on account of their religious character or speech.</summary>
