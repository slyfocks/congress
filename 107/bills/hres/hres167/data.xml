  <summary>6/14/2001--Introduced.
Recognizes: (1) the need to encourage active involvement of fathers in the rearing and development of their children; and (2) that while millions of fathers serve as wonderful caring parents for their children, there are children on Father's Day who will have no one to celebrate with. Urges fathers to: (1) participate in their children's lives, both financially and emotionally; (2) understand the level of responsibility required when fathering a child; and (3) fulfill that responsibility. Encourages fathers to devote time, energy, and resources to their children.Declares that the House of Representatives is committed to assisting absent fathers to become more responsible and engaged in their children's lives.Calls upon fathers around the country to use the day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's lives, to spend Father's Day with them, and to express their love and support for them.</summary>
