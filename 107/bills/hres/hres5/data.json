Renames the Committee on Commerce the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Creates a Committee on Financial Services (with oversight over many of the areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Banking and Financial Services Committee).Requires the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to review and study: (1) on a continuing basis laws, programs, and activities of the intelligence community; and (2) on an exclusive basis the sources and methods of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the National Foreign Intelligence Program.Directs the Committee on House Administration to provide policy direction for the Inspector General and oversight of the Clerk, Sergeant-at-Arms, Chief Administrative Officer, and Inspector General.Increases the maximum number of: (1) members of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 16 to 18; and (2) such members from one party from nine to ten.Amends rule XI to authorize each committee (other than the Appropriations, Budget, and Ways and Means committees) to fix the number of its members to constitute a quorum for taking any action other than one for which the presence of a majority of the committee is otherwise required (currently, any action other than the reporting of a measure or recommendation).Amends rule XIII to require reports on measures approved by committees to include a statement of general performance goals and objectives for which the measure authorizes funding (currently, a summary of oversight findings and recommendations by the Committee on Government Reform).Requires reports of the Appropriations Committee on a general appropriations bill to include a list of appropriations contained in the bill for expenditures not currently authorized by law for the period concerned, along with a statement of the last year for which such expenditures were authorized, the level of expenditures authorized for that year, the actual level of expenditures for that year, and the level of appropriations in the bill for such expenditures.Amends rule XXI to provide a point of order against consideration of legislation that provides for the designation or redesignation of a public work in honor of an individual then serving as a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator.Amends rule XXII to prohibit instructions to conferees in a motion to instruct or a motion to recommit to conference from including argument.Repeals rule XXIII (statutory limit on the public debt).Amends rule XXIII (formerly rule XXIV) to prohibit: (1) a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner from retaining a spouse in a paid position; and (2) a House employee from accepting compensation for work for a committee on which his or her spouse serves as a member.
