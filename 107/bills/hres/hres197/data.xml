Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to keep and bear arms, and that any United Nations (UN) conference, resolution, or treaty infringing on this right would be a conflict with article six of, and the second amendment to, the U.S. Constitution. Urges the President to reject any decree, proclamation, treaty, or other document adopted by the UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons which would infringe on the right of U.S. citizens under the second amendment to the Constitution.</summary>
