  <summary>7/26/2002--Introduced.
Expresses serious concern regarding the decision by the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the editors of `Science Express' to publish a blueprint that could conceivably enable terrorists to inexpensively create human pathogens for release on the people of the United States.Calls upon the scientific community, including publishers and editors of scientific publications, to establish ethical standards and exercise restraint to ensure that information that may be used by terrorists is not made widely available Encourages the executive branch to examine all policies relevant to the classification or publication of federally funded research to ensure that information that could be useful in the development of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons is not made accessible to terrorists or countries of proliferation concern.</summary>
