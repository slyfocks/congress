Encourages each father to devote time, energy, and resources to his children, recognizing that children need not only material support, but even more importantly, a secure and nurturing family environment.Commends the millions of fathers who serve as wonderful, caring parents for their children, while also recognizing that there are children who will have no one with whom to celebrate on Father's Day.Calls on fathers across the Nation to use Father's Day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's lives, to spend Father's Day with their children, and to express their love and support for their children."
