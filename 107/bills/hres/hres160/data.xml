  <summary>6/25/2001--Passed House amended.
Declares that the House of Representations condemns and deplores: (1) the continued detention of Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan, Wu Jianmin, Tan Guangguang, Teng Chunyan, and other scholars detained on false charges by the Government of the People's Republic of China and calls for their immediate and unconditional release; (2) the lack of due process afforded to these detainees and the probable coercion of confessions from some of them; and (3) the ongoing and systematic pattern of human rights violations by the Chinese Government.Urges the Chinese Government to consider: (1) the implications to the broader U.S.-Chinese relationship of detaining and coercing confessions from U.S. citizens and permanent residents on unsubstantiated spying charges or suspicions; and (2) releasing Liu Yaping on medical parole, as provided for under Chinese law.Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the President should: (1) make the release of the scholars a top priority of U.S. foreign policy with the Chinese Government; (2) make every effort to assist the scholars and their families while discussions of their release continue; (3) make it clear that the detention of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and the infliction of human rights violations upon U.S. citizens and residents are not in the interests of the Chinese Government; and (4) send a special, high ranking representative to reiterate the deep concern of the United States regarding the continued imprisonment of the scholars and to discuss their legal status and immediate humanitarian needs.</summary>
