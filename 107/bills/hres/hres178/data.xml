      <text>POINT OF ORDER - Mr. Moran (VA) raised a point of order against consideration of H. Res. 178 on the grounds that it violated section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act in that it provided for an unfunded mandate. The House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate on the point of order. At the conclusion of debate on the point of order, the Speaker announced that the question would be put on the motion to consider the resolution.</text>
