  <summary>1/3/2001--Introduced.
Declares that the House of Representatives opposes: (1) the imposition of criminal liability on any Internet service provider based on content supplied or controlled by, or because of links controlled by, a third party; (2) efforts by foreign governments to hold Internet service providers based in the United States criminally liable under foreign laws for content that is protected by the First Amendment, processed by servers located in the United States, and not targeted toward the citizens of the foreign country; and (3) the expansion of liability for Internet service providers under international treaties which might expose such providers based in the United States to criminal liability for third-party content.</summary>
