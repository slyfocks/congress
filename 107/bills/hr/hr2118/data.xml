Directs the Committee to advise the Secretary and the Assistant Secretary of HHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner regarding how to: (1) provide public input on the public's needs regarding tick-borne disorders (lyme and other infectious diseases) so that government agencies can coordinate and more effectively plan and execute their activities; and (2) develop informed responses to constituency groups regarding the efforts and progress of the HHS and SAA.Authorizes appropriations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to: (1) focus on developing better diagnostic tools and tests, expanding educational efforts, and re-educating clinicians, medical license boards, and health care insurers about the inappropriate uses of the Lyme disease case surveillance definition in patient diagnosis and treatment; and (2) collaborate with the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and other appropriate agencies for further research on tick-borne disorders, including study of preventive methods to decrease exposure to them.Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health to coordinate activities and research regarding tick-borne diseases across Institutes to encourage collaborative research.</summary>
