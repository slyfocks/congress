    "text": "21st Century Media Responsibility Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to state that it is the policy of Congress to provide for the establishment, use, and enforcement of a consistent and comprehensive system for labeling violent content in audio and visual media products, including the appropriateness of such products for minors.Authorizes manufacturers and producers of interactive video game, video program, motion picture, and sound recording products to submit to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a joint proposal for a system for labeling violent content. Outlines labeling system requirements, including that: (1) such product shall specify a minimum age for purchase and viewing; and (2) the label should appear conspicuously on the product. Directs the FTC to establish its own labeling system if a proposal is not submitted.Prohibits a person from: (1) manufacturing or producing such a product unless it bears a label meeting requirements of this Act; or (2) selling such product to an individual under the minimum age specified under the labeling system.Provides civil penalties for violations.Renames the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as the Federal Cigarette and Media Violence Labeling and Advertising Act."
