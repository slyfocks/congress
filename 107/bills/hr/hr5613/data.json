Defines \"demonstration facility\" as a facility serving at-risk youth or performing outreach to school-age youth.Requires the selected areas to include various areas, including one that has a shortage of mental health professionals and one located in an Indian reservation.Prohibits grants from going to applicants that do not agree to report certain information to the Secretaries, including on: (1) demographics of the youth in the project; (2) the outcomes of the screening; (3) referrals based on outcomes; (4) treatment based on referrals; (5) suicide, including suicide attempts and rates, to the extent practicable. Prohibits the Secretaries from discriminating against an applicant due to the applicant's inability to collect information on suicide.Directs the Secretaries to convene an advisory panel to advise each of the Secretaries regarding the use or improvement of the screening methods to detect mental illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth."
