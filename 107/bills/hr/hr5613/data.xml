Prohibits the Secretaries from discriminating against an applicant due to the applicant's inability to collect information on suicide.Directs the Secretaries to convene an advisory panel to advise each of the Secretaries regarding the use or improvement of the screening methods to detect mental illness and suicidal tendencies in school-age youth.</summary>
