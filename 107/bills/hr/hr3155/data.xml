Depleted Uranium Munitions Suspension and Study Act of 2001 - Directs the Secretary of Defense and other Federal entities to suspend the use and approval for foreign sale or export of depleted uranium munitions until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies to specified congressional committees that studies indicate such munitions will not jeopardize the health of U.S. or NATO military personnel or civilian populations if used in future conflicts.Limits subsequent use, foreign sale, or export to stocks certifiably free of plutonium and other transuranic matter.Directs the Comptroller General to investigate the contamination of stocks of depleted uranium munitions with transuranic elements.Requires the Directors of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to jointly and comprehensively study the health effects of exposure to such weapons on veterans and their children, as well as a public health assessment of persons with an epidemiological link to military installations or production facilities where such munitions have been used or produced. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a comprehensive study of possible environmental contamination at these installations or facilities. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) furnish to the Administrator with a list of sites; and (2) develop a plan for their mitigation and cleanup (consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969).</summary>
