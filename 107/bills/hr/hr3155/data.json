Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to conduct a comprehensive study of possible environmental contamination at these installations or facilities. Requires the Secretary of Defense to: (1) furnish to the Administrator with a list of sites; and (2) develop a plan for their mitigation and cleanup (consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969)."
