(Current law requires specific authorization and appropriation for the use of those moneys.)Instructs the Secretary to report to Congress regarding: (1) the results and conclusions of the geotechnical studies; and (2) total cost estimates regarding the Secretary's preferred alternative to address such environmental restoration and compliance needs, as well as waste management, at the Reserve.Authorizes the Secretary, following submission of the report, to access such moneys without further appropriation if the cost estimate does not exceed the total moneys covered into the Treasury under this Act and remaining available for obligation. Provides that, if the cost estimate exceeds available moneys, the Secretary may only access such moneys as subsequently authorized by Congress."
