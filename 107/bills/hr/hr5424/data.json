    "text": "Identity Theft Victims Assistance Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal criminal code to require a business entity that possesses information relating to an alleged identity theft or that has done business with a person that has made unauthorized use of identification of a victim to provide, upon written request, a copy of all application and business transaction information related to such alleged theft to the victim, any law enforcement agency or officer specified by the victim, and any law enforcement agency investigating the identity theft and authorized by the victim to receive such information. Requires verification of the identity of the victim and proof of claim prior to release of the information. Protects businesses from liability for good-faith releases of information for identification and prosecution of identity theft or to assist a victim.Authorizes civil enforcement actions by State attorneys general regarding identity theft and allows intervention by the U.S. Attorney General.Amends the: (1) Fair Credit Reporting Act to direct a consumer reporting agency to block the reporting of any information identified by the consumer in such consumer's file resulting from identity theft, subject to specified requirements; and (2) Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 to include within report contents specified descriptions regarding identity theft."
