    "text": "Working From Poverty to Promise Act of 2002 - Amends title IV part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require State plans to include poverty reduction plans. Requires States to: (1) identify and remedy barriers to employment for TANF recipients; and (2) develop and revise self-sufficiency plans.Repeals the limitation on the number of persons per family who may be treated as engaged in work by reason of participation in educational activities. Specifies as allowable work activities certain limited participation in vocational or educational training (including postsecondary education), work-study, and related internships.Requires State plans to certify that the State will assess its regional economies and share the results with its political subdivisions.Requires States to assess their economies to identify and report to the Secretary on higher-entry level wage opportunities in industries experiencing labor shortages. Requires the Secretary to make bonus grants to States as rewards for providing exceptional economic opportunity and accountability.Revises the meaning of \"assistance\" (with respect to the five-year limit on TANF) for families with income from employment to exclude any benefit or service for any month if the family includes an adult or minor child head of household who has received at least a certain State-determined amount of income. Revises the hardship exception to the five-year limit on TANF to require a State to define hardship to include mental illness and disability that is not sufficient to make the sufferer eligible for benefits under SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income). Permits the State to authorize additional Secretary-approved hardship exceptions.Requires State plans to provide for case management planning and services for hardship clients with multiple barriers to employment.Authorizes fiscal adjustments for inflation and continuation of waivers."
