Requires redistribution to other hospitals of 75 percent of the difference between such applicable resident limit and the reference resident level, if a hospital's resident level is less than such limit. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the otherwise applicable resident limit for any other hospital that has applied to the Secretary for such increase.
