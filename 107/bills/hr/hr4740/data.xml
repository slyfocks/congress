  <summary>5/15/2002--Introduced.
Chronic Wasting Disease Research and Response Act of 2002 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United States Geological Survey, to establish and coordinate a national research program to assess chronic wasting disease (the transmissible animal disease that afflicts deer and elk).Includes among program elements requirements that the Secretary: (1) provide States with technical and financial assistance and timely information to prevent disease expansion; (2) design a national program for disease monitoring and surveillance; (3) conduct research to determine how the disease is transmitted; (4) develop new non-lethal detection and diagnostic methods to identify the disease in free-ranging cervid populations; (5) develop safe methods of disposal of infected carcasses; (6) instruct Federal land managers to determine the presence of the disease, the likelihood of transmission to adjacent non-Federal lands, and management options for infestations; and (7) develop a public outreach and education strategy for the hunting community and the public.</summary>
