    "text": "Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a priority listing among utilities for the transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from them to a specified permanent repository.Mandates that the highest priority be assigned to utilities that derive the highest percentage of energy produced or sold from renewable energy resources, including solar, wind, ocean, or geothermal energy, biomass, landfill gas, a generation offset (reduced electricity usage metered at a site where a customer consumes energy from a renewable energy technology), or incremental hydropower.Instructs the Secretary to: (1) establish the listing not later than one year before the projected date of the first transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel to the permanent repository; and (2) coordinate the transportation of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from sources other than utilities for which priorities are established under this Act with transportation from such utilities, with the goal of minimizing the number of shipments by combining them whenever possible."
