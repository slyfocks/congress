Allows such States to use the grant to provide supplemental housing benefits and to pay the costs of minor rehabilitation of housing owned or rented by individuals eligible for TANF assistance, consistent with a definition of minor housing rehabilitation adopted by the State.(Sec. 106) Defines "assistance" to mean payment, by cash, voucher, or other means, to or for an individual or family for the purpose of meeting a subsistence need of the individual or family (including food, clothing, shelter, and related items, but not including costs of transportation, child care, or supplemental housing benefits), with certain exceptions.(Sec. 107) Extends the maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement for five years, through FY 2008, and allows a State to count as a qualifying MOE expenditure amounts of child support arrearages distributed to former TANF families.(Sec. 108) Amends SSA title XI to increase the total annual cap on Federal funding for public assistance programs for the territories, and to reauthorize through FY 2007 matching grants connected with territory public assistance programs.(Sec. 109) Amends SSA title IV part A to eliminate an interest-bearing loan fund for State TANF programs.(Sec. 110) Restores permanently a State's authority to transfer up to ten percent of any annual grant made to it under TANF to carry out State programs pursuant to title XX (Block Grant to States for Social Services) (SSBG), beginning in FY 2003.

Requires an IRP for each adult and minor child head of household. Requires the State agency to: (1) monitor the participation of each adult recipient in the activities specified in the IRP; (2) regularly review family progress toward self-sufficiency; and, upon such review, (3) revise the plan and activities required under the plan as the State deems appropriate in consultation with the family. Requires such a review before imposing a sanction.

Limits the number of families treated as being engaged in work for any month to ten percent of the average monthly number of families to which assistance is provided under the State TANF program during the fiscal year or the immediately preceding fiscal year (but not both, as the State may elect).Allows a State to exempt from work requirements the full-time caregiver of a family member who is disabled and to exclude this family in calculating the State's work participation rate, if: (1) there are no other adults in the family who are able-bodied; (2) the State or locality administering the State TANF program determines that the demands of caregiving do not allow the recipient to obtain or retain employment of at least 30 hours per week; and (3) the need to provide caregiving is specified in the recipient's IRP.Title III: Family Promotion and Support - (Sec. 301) Amends SSA title IV part A to repeal illegitimacy reduction bonus funding, replacing it with a new Healthy Marriage Promotion Grant program to support demonstration projects to promote stronger families, with an emphasis on the promotion of healthy marriages.
