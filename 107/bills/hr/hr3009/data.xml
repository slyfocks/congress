  <summary>7/26/2002--Conference report filed in House.
Trade Act of 2002 - Division A: Trade Adjustment Assistance - Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002 - Title I: Trade Adjustment Assistance Program - Subtitle A: Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers - (Sec. 111) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to reauthorize the trade adjustment assistance (TAA) program through FY 2007 for workers and firms adversely affected by import competition. (All workers referred to in this summary are adversely affected workers, unless otherwise indicated.) Reauthorizes the TAA program for farmers adversely affected by import competition through FY 2007. Provides for continuation of assistance beyond FY 2007 for certain eligible workers and farmers.(Sec. 112) Revises requirements with respect to the filing of a petition for eligibility certification of a group of workers for TAA. Authorizes the petition to be filed simultaneously with the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) and with the Governor of the State in which such worker's firm is located by employers of such workers, one-stop operators or one-stop partners, including State employment security agencies, or the State dislocated worker unit established on behalf of such workers. Requires the Governor, upon receipt of a petition, to: (1) ensure that rapid response assistance, and appropriate core and intensive services authorized under other Federal laws, are made available to the workers; and (2) assist the Secretary in the review of the petition and providing other assistance as the Secretary may request.Reduces from 60 to 40 days the review period within which the Secretary must respond to petitions for certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance.(Sec. 113) Revises requirements with respect to eligibility certification of a group of workers for TAA. Requires the Secretary to certify a group of workers as eligible to apply for such assistance if a significant number or proportion of workers in a firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and that: (1) the sales or production, or both, of the firm have decreased absolutely, imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm have increased, and the increase in such imports contributed to the workers' separation or threat of separation and to the decline in the sales or production of the firm; or (2) there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm (or subdivision) to a foreign country of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm and the country to which the firm has shifted production is party to a free trade agreement with the United States or is a beneficiary country under the Andean Trade Preference Act, African Growth and Opportunity Act, or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, or there has been or is likely to be an increase in imports of articles that are likely or directly competitive with articles produced by the firm.Provides for the TAA-eligibility certification of adversely affected secondary workers employed at a supplier or downstream producer to a firm that employed a group of workers certified TAA-eligible. Defines "downstream producer" as a firm that performs additional, value-added production processes to articles produced by another firm which are the basis for the eligibility certification for a group of workers employed by such other firm because of an increase in imports from, or a shift in production to, Canada or Mexico.(Sec. 114) Revises enrollment in training requirements with respect to qualification for trade readjustment allowances, setting an enrollment deadline of 16 weeks after separation.(Sec. 115) Authorizes the Secretary to waive the training enrollment requirement for all TAA-eligible workers if training is not feasible or appropriate because, among other reasons, the worker: (1) will be recalled by the firm from which the separation occurred; (2) possesses marketable skills for suitable employment; (3) is within two years of meeting requirements for retirement benefits; or (4) is unable to participate in training for health reasons.(Sec. 116) Extends for an additional 26 weeks (130 weeks in total) the permissible maximum period for payment of TAA to workers who require a program of remedial education to complete their job training.Declares that for purposes of TAA eligibility a worker shall be treated as participating in training during any week which is a part of a break in training that does not exceed 30 days (currently, 14 days) if the worker was participating in an approved training program before the beginning of such break in training and the program provides for the break.(Sec. 117) Increases to $220 million the annual total amount of worker training payments.(Sec. 118) Sets forth training programs that are approved for such workers, including employer-based training that provides on-the-job training and customized training. Authorizes the Secretary to pay the costs of on-the-job training of a worker only if, among other things, the employer is provided reimbursement of not more than 50 percent of the wage rate of the participant, for the cost of providing the training, and additional supervision related to such training.(Sec. 119) Requires the Secretary to make every reasonable effort to secure for workers certain employment services provided through one-stop delivery systems under the Workforce Investment Act.(Sec. 120) Allows funds obligated for certain activities to be expended by a State in the succeeding two fiscal years.(Sec. 121) Increases to $1,250 per worker the maximum amount of job search and relocation allowances.(Sec. 123) Repeals the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) transitional adjustment assistance program to provide for a single, unified TAA program.(Sec. 124) Directs the Secretary to establish an alternative TAA program for older workers. Provides up to $10,000 per worker over two years of certain wage benefits to workers age 50 or older who do not earn more than $50,000 a year in wages from reemployment.(Sec. 125) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary, working independently and in conjunction with the States, should provide workers with more specific information about benefits, training, and other employment services, as well as application procedures, under the TAA program.Subtitle B: TAA For Firms - (Sec. 131) Reauthorizes through FY 2007 the TAA program for firms adversely affected by import competition.Subtitle C: TAA For Farmers - (Sec. 141) Authorizes a group of agricultural commodity producers (farmers and ranchers) to petition the Secretary of Agriculture for a certification of TAA application eligibility.
