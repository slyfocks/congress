Anti-Hoax Terrorism Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for engaging in conduct with intent to convey false or misleading information that may reasonably be believed and that concerns an activity which would violate prohibitions regarding biological weapons, chemical weapons, nuclear materials, or weapons of mass destruction.Makes any persons who engage in such conduct jointly and severally liable to any party incurring expenses incident to any emergency or investigative response to that conduct. Directs the court to order a defendant who has been convicted of such an offense to reimburse any party incurring such expenses. Specifies that an order of reimbursement shall, for the purposes of enforcement, be treated as a civil judgment.</summary>
