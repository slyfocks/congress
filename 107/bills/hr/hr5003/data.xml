Removes the annual cap on such amount.Requires: (1) limits on the amount of premium pay which may be earned by officers and members during emergencies to be applied by the Board on an annual and not pay period basis; and (2) the Board to provide that if an officer or member completes three years of employment he or she shall receive eight hours of annual leave per pay period.Provides, with limitations, that: (1) neither the Federal Civil Service Retirement System nor the Federal Employees Retirement System shall apply to any reemployed annuitant performing service as an officer or member; and (2) such annuitant shall be exempted from the Systems by this Act shall not become subject to them.Requires the Board to establish a tuition reimbursement program to assist officers and members in higher education costs relating to law-enforcement.
