  <summary>6/21/2002--Introduced.
Extends through FY 2013 a provision that guarantees an annual increase in the basic pay of military personnel by at least the percentage increase for Federal employees determined on the basis of the increase in the Employment Cost Index, plus one half percent. Requires, for FY 2014 and beyond, an annual increase by the same percentage as the increase for Federal employees, without regard to: (1) the one half percent reduction currently required for such Federal employees; and (2) whether Federal rates of pay are actually increased during that fiscal year.</summary>
