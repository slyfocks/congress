Live Performing Arts Labor Relations Amendments - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to exempt, from a prohibition against employer or labor organization boycotts, any leaders, contractors, purchasers of live entertainment or live music, promoters, producers, or persons similarly engaged or involved in an integrated production or performance of any kind in the live entertainment industry.Allows employers who hire, or contract for the services of, persons engaged in the live performing arts to make agreements covering such persons with labor organizations of which performing artists are members (provided that certain unfair labor practices are not involved), even if the majority status of such labor organization has been previously established or such agreement requires membership in such labor organization as a condition of employment.Revises definitions of: (1) employer, to include purchasers of live musical performance services regardless of whether the performer is an independent contractor, employer, or employee of another employer; and (2) employee, to include independent contractors (other than employers) engaged to perform live musical services.</summary>
