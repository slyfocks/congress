Canceling Loans to Allow School Systems to Attract Classroom Teachers Act - (Sec. 2) Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) to provide for additional amounts of student loan forgiveness for certain elementary and secondary school teachers. Directs the Secretary of Education, in making such additional repayments, to give priority to teachers of: (1) special education for children with disabilities, if they are certified as having knowledge and skills in their content areas and are employed by local educational agencies that have failed to make progress toward meeting certain objectives; or (2) mathematics or science.(Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Education to discharge or cancel the Federal student loan indebtedness, under HEA, of spouses, surviving joint debtors, and parents of public servants and other individuals who died (or die) or who became (or become) permanently and totally disabled from injuries suffered in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to notify local educational agencies eligible for the Small Rural Achievement Program, under the Elementary and Secondary Education of 1965, of this Act's making available additional amounts of student loan forgiveness to teachers in their rural schools, and to encourage such agencies to notify their teachers of such benefits.</summary>
