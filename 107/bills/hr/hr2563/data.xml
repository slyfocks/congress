Bipartisan Patient Protection Act - Title I: Improving Managed Care - Subtitle A: Utilization Review; Claims; and Internal and External Appeals - Requires a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer (plan and issuer) providing health insurance coverage, to conduct utilization review activities in connection with the provision of benefits under such plan or coverage only in accordance with an approved utilization review program. Defines "utilization review" and "utilization review activities" to mean procedures used to monitor or evaluate the use or coverage, clinical necessity, appropriateness, efficacy, or efficiency of health care services, procedures or settings, and includes prospective review, concurrent review, second opinions, case management, discharge planning, or retrospective review. Requires a utilization review program to, among other things, be: (1) administered by qualified health care professionals; and (2) conducted consistent with written policies and procedures that govern all aspects of the program.(Sec. 102) Sets forth procedures concerning initial claims and notice for benefits, including setting forth a timeline for making benefit determinations and expedited determinations any time there is a serious threat to an individual's health or life.(Sec. 103) Provides an appeals procedure and appeals timeline.(Sec. 104) Requires a plan and issuer offering health insurance coverage, to provide beneficiaries, and enrollees (or authorized representatives), upon request, with access to an independent external review for any denial of a claim for benefits. Sets forth penalties for noncompliance. Sets forth standards for reviewers.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish the Health Care Consumer Assistance Fund to be used to award grants to eligible States to carry out consumer assistance activities designed to provide information, assistance, and referrals to consumers of health insurance products. Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle B: Access to Care - Requires a plan and issuer providing coverage to provide for coverage of services only if the services are furnished through health care professionals and providers who are members of a network of health care professionals and providers who have entered into a contract with the plan or issuer to provide such services to offer (at the time of enrollment and during an annual open season) the option of health insurance coverage or health benefits which provide for coverage of such services which are not furnished through health care professionals and providers who are members of such a network unless there is also offered non-network coverage through another plan or issuer in the group market.(Sec. 112) Requires a plan or issuer providing for the designation of a participating primary care provider to permit each participant, beneficiary, and enrollee to designate any participating primary care provider or specialist who is available to accept such individual.(Sec. 113) Requires a plan or issuer offering emergency health services to cover emergency health services without prior authorization and by either a participating or nonparticipating health care provider.(Sec. 114) Requires the timely provision of access to specialists.(Sec. 115) Requires direct patient access for obstetrical and gynecological services.(Sec. 116) Requires a plan or issuer providing for the designation of a participating primary care provider for a child to permit the designation of pediatrician as a child's primary care provider.(Sec. 117) Sets forth provisions concerning continuation of care when a provider is terminated.(Sec. 118) Requires a plan or issuer, to the extent that there is coverage for benefits with respect to prescription drugs and such coverage is limited to drugs included in a formulary to: (1) ensure the participation of physicians and pharmacists in developing and reviewing such formulary; (2) provide for disclosure of the formulary to providers; and (3) in accordance with the applicable quality assurance and utilization review standards of the plan or issuer, provide for exceptions from the formulary limitation when a non-formulary alternative is medically necessary and appropriate and, in the case of such an exception, apply the same cost-sharing requirements that would have applied in the case of a drug covered under the formulary.Prohibits a group health plan (or health insurance offered in connection with such a plan) covering drugs or medical devices from denying of coverage of a drug or device on the basis that the use is investigational, if the use: (1) in the case of a prescription drug, is included in the labeling authorized by the application in effect for the drug pursuant to specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Public Health Service Act, without regard to any postmarketing requirements that may apply under either such Act; or (2) in the case of a medical device, is included in the labeling authorized by a regulation or approved application under specified provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, without regard to any postmarketing requirements that may apply under such Act.
