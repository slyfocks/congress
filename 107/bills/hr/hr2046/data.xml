  <summary>5/26/2001--Introduced.
Coastal Shipping Competition Act - Amends Federal shipping law to define "coastwise trade" to mean the transportation by water of merchandise or passengers, or the towing of a vessel between points, or dredging operations (except on navigable waters included in the inland waterways trade unless they occur on mixed waters) in the United States, on the Great Lakes, on the subjacent waters of the Outer Continental Shelf, and in the noncontiguous trade.Revises certain eligibility requirements for the documentation of a vessel to engage in U.S. coastwise trade to make certain vessels that are not titled in a State eligible for documentation.Authorizes a foreign qualified vessel, or a vessel of foreign registry that engages irregularly in U.S. coastwise trade, to be issued a U.S. coastwise certificate if the governments involved extend reciprocal privileges to U.S. vessels to engage in their coastwise trades.Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) certificate of documentation for inland waterways endorsement of vessels in U.S. coastwise trade; (2) transportation of merchandise in inland waterways trades; (3) penalties for transportation of passengers in vessels nondocumented with an inland waterways endorsement; (4) the towing of vessels (other than one in distress), and salvaging and dredging operations performed, by foreign registered vessels (in which the foreign country extends such reciprocal privileges to U.S. vessels) and vessels documented with an inland waterways endorsement; (5) penalties for the placing of a documented vessel, or operation of such vessel, under foreign registry; (6) district court jurisdiction over nonresident defendant employers that make use of U.S. ports with respect to personal injury and death actions by seamen; (7) application of international labor laws and environmental and certain other standards to all vessels operating in U.S. coastwise trade pursuant to international agreements; and (8) certain noncitizens irregularly engaging in U.S. coastwise trade.</summary>
