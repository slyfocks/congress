Requires consumers to be informed that registration does not mean that: (1) the product is endorsed or approved by the Government; (2) the Secretary has conducted any investigation to confirm that the product meets the definition of \"American made\" in this Act; or (3) the product contains 100 percent U.S. content.Directs the Secretary to propose regulations to: (1) establish a voluntary product registration procedure; (2) establish and collect a fee to cover registration costs; (3) establish the pilot program; and (4) assess manufacturer interest in the program.Sets forth registration fee amount, crediting, and collection provisions.Imposes civil monetary and Federal procurement penalties for knowingly registering a product that is not American made."
