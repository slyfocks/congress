Made in America Information Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, upon a determination that there is sufficient manufacturer interest and that manufacturers will provide fees so the program will operate without Federal Government cost, to establish a three-year toll-free telephone number pilot program solely to help inform consumers whether a product with a retail value of at least $250 is made in America.Requires the Secretary to contract for the establishment and operation of such pilot program.
