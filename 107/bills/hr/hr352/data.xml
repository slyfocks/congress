  <summary>1/31/2001--Introduced.
Voluntary Environmental Self-Evaluation Act - Makes information contained in any voluntary environmental self-evaluation and any related testimony inadmissible evidence (and not subject to discovery) in Federal or State administrative or judicial proceedings under any Federal environmental law. Makes such privilege inapplicable to information: (1) required to be developed, maintained, or reported pursuant to such laws; or (2) with respect to a regulated entity's intentional or willful violation of such a law.Provides immunity from prosecution for voluntary disclosures of information relating to violations of an environmental law as a result of a voluntary environmental self-evaluation if certain conditions are met, including that the disclosure is made promptly and efforts to achieve compliance are initiated. Precludes immunity if the violation concerned is part of a pattern of significant violations.</summary>
