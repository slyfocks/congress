  <summary>8/2/2001--Introduced.
Arsenic-Lumber Child Protection Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate lumber treated with inorganic arsenicals or chromated copper arsenicals (CCA lumber) under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), notwithstanding exemptions from FIFRA regulation of pesticides used in the treatment of wood products. Requires that such regulation deem CCA lumber as misbranded unless its labeling discloses that: (1) it has been treated with arsenic; and (2) manufacture or commercial distribution of a product constructed with such lumber is a violation of Federal law if the product is playground equipment or any item intended for use primarily by children.Requires a study concerning the health effects of using consumer products whose usual use involves direct contact with CCA lumber.</summary>
