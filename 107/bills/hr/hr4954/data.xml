  <summary>6/28/2002--Passed House amended.
Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2002 - Title I: Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to add a new part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) under which each individual who is entitled to benefits under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) or enrolled under Medicare part B (Supplemental Medical Insurance) is entitled to obtain qualified prescription drug coverage by electing to enroll: (1) in a plan that provides qualified prescription drug coverage under the Medicare+Choice program under SSA title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice) (M+C); or (2) in a prescription drug plan (PDP) under part D if the individual is not enrolled in a M+C plan providing qualified prescription drug coverage.Outlines standard coverage benefit packages for FY 2005. Includes for the standard package an annual deductible of $250, and requires insurers under such package to cover 80 percent of enrollees drug costs from $251 to $1,000, then 50 percent of such costs between $1,001 and the initial coverage limit of $2,000. Requires enrollees to cover all costs between $2,001 and $3,700, and Medicare to cover the entire cost once the beneficiary has reached the $3,700 catastrophic limit. Prescribes a formula for adjustment of the deductible and thresholds for years after 2005.Establishes a competitive bidding process for negotiating the terms and conditions of PDP sponsors.Provides for full premium subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing for individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. Contains subsidy payments for qualifying entities to promote the participation of PDP sponsors.Creates in the Treasury the Medicare Prescription Drug Trust Fund for use in the new part D program.(Sec. 104) Prohibits, effective January 1, 2005, the issuance of new Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies with prescription drug coverage unless the policy replaces another policy with drug coverage. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to policies meeting new standards outlined in this Act. Guarantees issuance of a substitute Medigap policy for persons, enrolling in a PDP under part D, who at the time of such enrollment were enrolled in and terminated enrollment in a Medigap policy H, I, or J. Provides such guaranteed enrollment for any of the policy benefit packages A through G. Prohibits discrimination in the pricing of such policy because of health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, or medical condition and the imposition of an exclusion of benefits based on a pre-existing condition under such policy.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), or the Medicare Benefits Administrator, to: (1) establish for Medicare beneficiaries programs to endorse prescription drug discount card programs that meet specified requirements; (2) make available to Medicare beneficiaries information regarding such endorsed programs; and (3) provide for an appropriate transition and discontinuation of such program at the time prescription drug benefits first become available under part D.Provides low-income Medicare beneficiaries with immediate assistance in the purchase of covered outpatient prescription drugs during the period before the program under part D becomes effective.Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the PDP program under part D.Title II: Medicare+Choice Revitalization and Medicare+Choice Competition Program - Subtitle A: Medicare+Choice Revitalization - Amends SSA title XVIII part C to make changes to the M+C payment amounts for 2003 and 2004, revising calculation of the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC), the blend payment, and Medicare+Choice payment rates, including in such payment rates the costs of Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs military facility services to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries.Directs: (1) the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to conduct a study for a report to Congress on the method used for determining the AAPCC; and (2) the Secretary to submit to Congress a report on the impact of additional financing on the availability of M+C plans in different areas and its impact on lowering premiums and increasing benefits under such plans.(Sec. 202) Extends permanently the M+C reporting deadline changes temporarily changed by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and makes the annual, coordinated election period temporarily changed by such Act permanent.(Sec. 203) Makes Federal standards supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to M+C plans offered by M+C organizations.(Sec. 204) Allows specialized M+C plans for special needs beneficiaries to be any type of coordinated care plan.(Sec. 205) Makes permanent the current demonstration for coverage under M+C medical savings account (MSA) plans and eliminates the associated enrollment cap.(Sec. 206) Allows a reasonable cost contract to be extended or renewed beyond December 31, 2004, if there were no coordinated care M+C plans in its service area.Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 to extend the waivers permitting operation of the social health maintenance organization (SHMO) demonstration program through December 31, 2004. Provides that nothing prevents a SHMO from offering an M+C plan.Subtitle B: Medicare+Choice Competition Program - Outlines a: (1) Medicare+Choice competition program allowing for the submission of bid amounts by Medicare+Choice organizations for the provision of all items and services; and (2) competitive-demonstration program under which Medicare+Choice areas are designated as competitive-demonstration areas.Title III: Rural Health Care Improvements - Amends SSA title XVIII to provide that starting for discharges on or after October 1, 2002, hospitals (other than urban hospitals with a 100 or more beds or certain public hospitals) will receive payments based on a blend of their current disproportionate share (DSH) adjustment and the current DSH adjustment for large urban hospitals. Limits such new DSH adjustment at 10 percent for any hospital that is not classified as a rural referral center.(Sec. 303) Provides that for discharges occurring: (1) during FY 2003, the average standardized amount for hospitals located other than in a large urban area shall be increased by half the difference between the average standardized amount for hospitals located in large urban areas for such fiscal year and such amount determined for other hospitals for such fiscal year; and (2) during FY 2004 and afterwards, the Secretary shall compute one standardized amount for all hospitals increased by the applicable percentage increase, and use this amount to pay all hospitals.(Sec. 304) Directs the Secretary, after revising the market basket cost weights to reflect the most current data available, to establish a frequency for revising such weights in such market basket to reflect the most current data available more frequently than once every five years.(Sec. 305) Revises the critical access hospital (CAH) program: (1) reinstating payments made on a periodic interim payment basis for inpatient services starting with payments made on or after January 1, 2003; (2) prohibiting the Secretary from requiring as a condition for applying the special physician payment adjustment with respect to a CAH, that each physician providing professional services in the hospital must assign billing rights with respect to such services, except that such condition shall not apply to those physicians who have not assigned such billing rights; (3) directing the Secretary to specify standards for determining whether a CAH has sufficiently strong seasonal variations in patient admissions to justify a five-bed increase in the number of inpatient acute beds it can maintain and still retain its classification as a CAH; and (4) extending the authorization of appropriations for the Medicare rural hospital flexibility program through FY 2007.Prohibits the Secretary from recouping (or otherwise seeking to recover) overpayments made for outpatient critical access hospital services under Medicare part B for services furnished in cost reporting periods that began before October 1, 2002, insofar as such overpayments are attributable to payment being based on 80 percent of reasonable costs (instead of 100 percent of reasonable costs minus 20 percent of charges).(Sec. 306) Amends the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BPIA) to extend through December 31, 2004, the ten percent additional payment for home health care furnished to beneficiaries residing in rural areas.(Sec. 309) Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study for a report to Congress on differences in payment amounts under the physician fee schedule for physicians' services in different geographic areas.(Sec. 310) Amends SSA title XI to provide that any remuneration in the form of a contract, lease, grant, loan, or other agreement between a public or non-profit private health center and any individual or entity providing goods or services to the health center is not a violation of the anti-kickback statute if such agreement contributes to the ability of the health center to maintain or increase the availability or quality of services provided to a medically underserved population served by the health center.(Sec. 311) Provides for a temporary adjustment for FY 2003 through 2005 for non-teaching hospitals in certain rural and urban areas where operating costs exceed operating payments.Title IV: Provisions Relating to Part A - Subtitle A: Inpatient Hospital Services - Amends SSA title XVIII to: (1) set the hospital update factor at the market basket percentage increase minus .25 percentage points for all hospitals, except sole community hospitals which receive an update factor of the full market basket; (2) increase the level of adjustment for indirect costs of medical education in FY 2003 and FY 2004; (3) make changes to the mechanism to recognize the costs of new medical services or technologies, requiring, among other changes, for the Secretary to provide for the addition of new diagnosis and procedure codes in April 1 of each year that would not be required to affect Medicare's payment or diagnosis related group classification until the following fiscal year; and (4) provide for adjustment of the Federal rate for discharges from hospitals in Puerto Rico to a blended amount based on a 50-50 split between Federal and local amounts through October 1, 2003, with, from FY 2004 through 2007, an increasing amount of the payment rate based on Federal national rates, a decreasing amount on Puerto Rico local rates.(Sec. 409) Directs the Comptroller General to conduct a study for a report to Congress on the improvements that can be made in the measurement of regional differences in hospital wages reflected in the hospital wage index.Subtitle B: Skilled Nursing Facility Services - Amends BIPA and SSA title XVIII to modify payment for covered skilled nursing facility (SNF) services: (1) directing the Secretary to increase by 12, 11, and 8 percent the nursing component of the case-mix adjusted Federal prospective payment rate specified in Tables 3 and 4 of the final rule published in the Federal Register by the Health Care Financing Administration on July 31, 2000, and as subsequently updated, effective for services furnished during FY 2003 through 2005;
