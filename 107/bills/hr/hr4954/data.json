Includes for the standard package an annual deductible of $250, and requires insurers under such package to cover 80 percent of enrollees drug costs from $251 to $1,000, then 50 percent of such costs between $1,001 and the initial coverage limit of $2,000. Requires enrollees to cover all costs between $2,001 and $3,700, and Medicare to cover the entire cost once the beneficiary has reached the $3,700 catastrophic limit. Prescribes a formula for adjustment of the deductible and thresholds for years after 2005.Establishes a competitive bidding process for negotiating the terms and conditions of PDP sponsors.Provides for full premium subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing for individuals with incomes below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level.
