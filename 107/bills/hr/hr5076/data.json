(The current authorization ends after FY 2002).Revises part C eligibility conditions to include those in families where there is diagnosed serious maternal depression, confirmed parental substance abuse, or documented family violence (including child abuse). Requires all abused or neglected children under age three to be referred to the State's child find system for evaluation and, if appropriate, receipt of early intervention services.Includes parent-child and family therapy among part C services.Includes early intervention personnel training and professional development among State and national activities. Directs the Secretary to make grants for such pre- and in-service training and development.Requires the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council under IDEA to study and report on mechanisms for providing service coordination from birth through age five for infants, toddlers, and children served under part C and preschool grant provisions."
