Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance for conducting such programs.Requires funds collected under such a program to be available to reimburse the agency for program expenses and to pay contractors for recovery services under the program. Requires remaining recovered amounts: (1) to be credited to the appropriations from which such payments were made that remain available for obligation; or (2) if no such appropriation remains available, to be disposed of by the affected agency head for carrying out a management improvement program (25 percent) with the remainder to be deposited in the Treasury."
