    "text": "Requires the Director of the National Science Foundation to award grants to consortia of institutions of higher education or nonprofit organizations with experience in plant biotechnology research (or both) to establish regional plant genome and gene expression research centers. Authorizes the Director to establish matching fund requirements. Includes among authorized center activities: (1) basic plant genomics research and genomics applications; (2) basic research that will contribute to the development or use of innovative plant-derived products; (3) basic research on alternative uses for plants and plant materials; and (4) basic research and dissemination of information on the ecological and other consequences of genetically engineered plants.Requires the Director to: (1) award grants to such institutions, organizations, or consortia to establish research partnerships for supporting the development of plant biotechnology targeted to the needs of the developing world; and (2) encourage inclusion of historically black colleges or universities, hispanic-serving institutions, or tribal colleges or universities in consortia that enter into such partnerships. Requires institutions, organizations, or consortia, to be eligible to receive a grant, to enter into a partnership with at least one research institution in at least one developing nation. Permits such a partnership to include for-profit companies involved in plant biotechnology. Includes among authorized activities: (1) basic genomic research on crops grown in the developing world; (2) basic research in plant biotechnology that will advance and expedite the development of improved cultivars; (3) basic research that could lead to the development of technologies to produce pharmaceutical compounds such as vaccines and medications in plants that can be grown in the developing world; and (4) research on the impact of plant biotechnology on the social, political, economic, and environmental conditions in developing countries.Authorizes appropriations."
