Veterans Tobacco-Related Illness Benefits Restoration Act of 2001 - Repeals a Federal provision which prohibits a veteran's disability or death from being considered to have resulted from a personal injury suffered or a disease contracted in the line of duty on the basis that it resulted from the use of tobacco products during the veteran's military, naval, or air service. Provides that such repeal shall apply to any claim for compensation received by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs before or after enactment of this Act.Prohibits the Director of the Office of Management and Budget from making any estimate of changes in direct spending outlays under provisions of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) for any fiscal year resulting from the enactment of this Act.</summary>
