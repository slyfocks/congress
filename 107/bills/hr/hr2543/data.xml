  <summary>7/18/2001--Introduced.
Amends Federal Postal law to require the U.S. Postal Service to adhere to an equitable tender policy in selecting carriers of non-priority bypass mail to any point served by more than one carrier in Alaska. Changes the requirement that such a carrier operate at least three scheduled flights each week to any point to a requirement of at least one, two, or three scheduled flights.Allows the Service to offer equitable tender of non-priority bypass mail at mainline service rates to a bush carrier providing service within Alaska from a hub point to a bush point if the bush point is also being served by a mainline carrier.Requires the Service to select only existing mainline carriers to provide non-priority bypass mail service to hub points in Alaska, except in certain circumstances. Permits the Service to select a carrier other than an existing mainline carrier if: (1) the Service determines that service to the hub point is deficient and provides written notice of such determination to existing mainline carriers to the hub point; and (2) after the 30-day period following issuance of such notice, the Service determines that deficiencies in service to the hub point have not been cured.</summary>
