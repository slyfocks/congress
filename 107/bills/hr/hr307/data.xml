  <summary>1/30/2001--Introduced.
Federal Protective Service Reform Act - Amends Federal law to redesignate special policemen of the General Services Administration (GSA) as police officers, and empower them to: (1) carry firearms; (2) petition Federal courts for and execute arrest and search warrants; (3) make arrests without a warrant; and (4) conduct investigations.Increases the maximum penalty for violations of any rules or regulations with respect to Federal property.Directs the Administrator to establish the Federal Protective Service (FPS) as a separate operating service of GSA, headed by a Commissioner.Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to survey the pay and benefits of all Federal police forces to determine whether any disparities exist that are not commensurate with differences in duties or working conditions.Mandates at least 730 full-time police officers in the FPS one year after the enactment of this Act, with no reduction unless specifically authorized by law.Directs the FPS Commissioner to: (1) prescribe minimum standards of employment suitability in the contracting of security personnel for Federal property; and (2) analyze each security personnel supply contract to determine if the use of personnel directly employed by the United States would be more cost effective.Federal Facility Safety Enhancement Act - Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to direct the GSA Administrator to notify: (1) Federal employees and, before enrollment of any child in a childcare facility located in a public building under GSA control, the child's parents or guardians of the identity of the building's current tenants and the designation of the building's level of security; and (2) the child's parents or guardians if any new Federal tenant is scheduled to take occupancy in such building.Requires the Administrator, after being informed of a serious threat that could affect the safety and security of Federal employees, the public, and children enrolled in such a childcare facility, to give notice of the threat to the contact person for each tenant and to the parents or guardians of each child in the facility.</summary>
