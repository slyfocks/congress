Small Business and Farm Energy Emergency Relief Act of 2001 - Amends the Small Business Act to authorize the Small Business Administration (SBA) to make disaster loans to assist small businesses that have suffered or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury as the result of a sharp and significant increase in the price of heating fuel or electricity. Prohibits any such loan from being made if the total amount outstanding and committed to the borrower would exceed $1.5 million, unless the applicant is a major source of employment in its surrounding area. Requires, for such assistance: (1) a declaration of a disaster by the President or the SBA Administrator; or (2) a certification from the Governor of the State that its small businesses have suffered such economic injury and are in need of assistance which is not otherwise available.Amends the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make loans to farm operations that qualify as a small business and have or are likely to suffer substantial economic injury from a sharp and significant increase in energy costs or input costs from energy sources occurring after June 1, 2000, in connection with an energy emergency declared by the President or the Secretary.</summary>
