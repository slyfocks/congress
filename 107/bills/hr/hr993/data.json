Exempts from such provisions offenses: (1) committed other than for profit; or (2) involving the smuggling, transporting, or harboring only of the defendant's spouse, child, or both.Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to: (1) exempt from specified alien smuggling or harboring criminal penalties persons rendering life threatening emergency assistance to an alien in the United States; and (2) subject specified alien smuggling and harboring crimes under the Act committed by an armed person to enhanced penalties.Directs the Commission to revise Federal sentencing guidelines to provide that plea bargaining and other prosecutorial policies, and district policy differences, are not a ground for sentence imposition outside applicable guidelines.Authorizes appropriations for alien smuggling-related undercover and enforcement activities."
