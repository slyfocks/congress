  <summary>4/11/2002--Introduced.
Medicare Access Equity Act of 2002 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, with respect to geographic adjustment factors in the determination of payments for physicians' services, to revise the formula for the physician fee schedule wage index. Terminates the requirement that the index reflect 1/4 of the difference between the relative value of physicians' work effort in each of the different fee schedule areas and the national average of such work effort. Makes the index equal to 1 for relative value of physicians' work effort in all fee schedule areas, without regard to specified limitations otherwise applicable.</summary>
