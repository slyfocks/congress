  <summary>3/20/2002--Introduced.
Amends Federal defense contract law and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit a contractor from being awarded a defense or Federal contract unless the Federal contracting officer determines that such contractor has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics, including compliance with all applicable laws. Outlines information to be considered by a contracting officer in making such determination, with an emphasis on any violations that have been adjudicated during the prior three-year period, as well as certain convictions of and civil judgments rendered against such contractor.</summary>
