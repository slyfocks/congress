  <summary>5/2/2002--Introduced.
Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2002 - Mandates satisfaction of judgements against a terrorist party from the frozen assets of terrorists, terrorist organizations, and State sponsors of terrorism. Authorizes the President to waive this requirement before the enforcement of any judicial order directing attachment in aid of execution against property subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, upon a determination on an asset-by-asset basis that waiver is necessary in the national security interest.Amends the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to set forth a special rule for cases against Iran with respect to distribution of foreign military sales funds inadequate to satisfy the amount of compensatory awards against Iran.</summary>
