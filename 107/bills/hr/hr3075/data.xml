  <summary>10/10/2001--Introduced.
Imported Food Safety Act of 2001 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the prior approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for commercial distribution of food imported into the United States. Cites factors for mandatory consideration by the Secretary when determining whether to grant such approval.Requires the Secretary to: (1) deny approval of foreign food for import if the foreign system for food inspection does not provide at least the same level of protection as domestic laws, or if the foreign country does not permit the Secretary to conduct food inspections within its borders; and (2) give high priority to increasing significantly the number of inspections, including port-of-entry testing for pesticide and microbial contamination.Sets forth criminal penalties for noncompliance. Deems certain foods to be misbranded if the country-of-origin labeling is not provided at the time they are offered for retail sale.Instructs the Secretary to prioritize research on port-of-entry food safety testing techniques whose results are available within 60 minutes after test administration.Directs the Secretary to impose user fees on imported food in order to defray increased expenses needed to implement this Act.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
