Permits only U.S. documented vessels to be used in the following operations involving Federal submarine cables: (1) laying a cable between two U.S. landings; (2) making a shore landing of a cable in the United States; (3) laying or burying a cable on or under lands beneath U.S. navigable waters; and (4) servicing or maintaining a cable between two landings in the United States or on or under lands beneath U.S. navigable waters. Authorizes the President to waive these requirements if no eligible vessel is available or if the waiver is critical to the national security of the United States. Directs the President to notify Congress of any waiver and the reasons for it.</summary>
