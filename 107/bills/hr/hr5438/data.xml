Valuation of Intangible Assets Act of 2002 - Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to: (1) evaluate for Congress the general usefulness of financial statements prepared under generally accepted accounting principles in providing accurate information to investors about intangible assets and operating performance measures; (2) consider the impact that shortcomings in generally accepted accounting principles have on securities market volatility, capital allocation, and the ability of investors to make sound judgments about valuation; (3) consider methods to better identify, value, and account for purchased and internally generated intangible assets; (4) examine the general questions surrounding the role of intangible assets in financial reporting in the economy; and (5) examine how enhanced disclosure can be accomplished without exposing industries or companies to increased litigation.</summary>
