Delineates certain elements the Secretary shall consider, including whether the area: (1) has resources that represent distinctive aspects of American heritage; (2) provides outstanding recreational and educational opportunities; (3) includes local and State governments and a variety of non-profit organizations, residents, and business interests that support such designation and have developed a conceptual financial plan; and (4) has a potential management entity to work with locals to support development consistent with continued local and State economic activity. Authorizes appropriations contingent on the area being designated as a heritage area, and limits the Federal assistance match to 50 percent of the total cost of any assistance or grant provided."
