Modifies a provision regarding the commissioning of private vessels for seizure of piratical vessels to authorize the President to instruct the leader of any suitable entity operating under the authority of any letters of marque and reprisal granted by Congress, whether on the high seas, in the skies, or on land, to subdue, seize, and take persons and property, using force as necessary to defend the lives, liberties, and property of U.S. citizens.
