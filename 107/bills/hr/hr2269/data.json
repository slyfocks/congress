Requires fiduciary advisers to keep for six years records necessary to determine whether the conditions of the exemption have been met.Requires such a fiduciary adviser to disclose: (1) fees or other compensation it receives relating to the provision of investment advice or a resulting sale or acquisition of securities or other property, including from third parties; (2) any interest it has and its affiliates have in any security or other property recommended, purchased or sold; (3) any limitation placed on its ability to provide advice; (4) the advisory services offered; (5) that it is acting as a fiduciary of the plan in connection with the provision of such advice; and (6) any information required to be disclosed under applicable securities laws. Requires such disclosure to be: (1) written to be understandable by the average plan participant; and (2) maintained in currently accurate form.Allows any such investment advice provided to participants or beneficiaries to be implemented only at their direction. Requires the terms of the transaction to be at least as favorable to the plan as an arm's length transaction would be. Requires to be reasonable any compensation received by the fiduciary adviser and its affiliates in connection with any transaction.Requires such a fiduciary adviser to provide the plan sponsor a written acknowledgment that it is acting as a fiduciary of the plan. Exempts from the duty to monitor the specific investment advice given by the fiduciary adviser a plan sponsor or other fiduciary that arranges for a fiduciary adviser to provide investment advice to participants and beneficiaries, if certain conditions are met under this Act. Declares that the plan sponsor or other fiduciary retains the duty of prudent selection and periodic review of the fiduciary adviser. Allows plan assets to be used to pay for the expenses of providing investment advice to participants and beneficiaries."
