    "text": "Transparency and Fairness Trade Act of 2001 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to extend the meaning of \"interested party\" for purposes of the filing of a petition alleging imported merchandise has been provided a subsidy with respect to its manufacture, or imported merchandise is being sold in the United States at less than fair value, and that such importation has materially injured (or threatened injury to) a domestic industry, or the establishment of a U.S. industry is materially retarded by reason of such importation. Includes as interested parties any industrial users of imported merchandise subject to a countervailing duty or antidumping duty investigation, or of a domestic like product (or an association a majority of whose members are industrial users of subject merchandise or domestic like product). Requires the administering authority not to issue a countervailing duty order or antidumping duty order to a particular product for a specified quantity or for more than a year if such authority determines from a relief application that a lack of domestic availability exists with respect to a particular product which is within the class or kind of merchandise that is the subject of an investigation, an order, or a suspension agreement. Sets forth requirements regarding application of \"lack of domestic availability\" exception to countervailing duty and antidumping duty orders and findings.Specifies interested parties (including industrial users) who are parties to an investigation that are entitled to access, through authorized representatives, to confidential business information under protective order."
