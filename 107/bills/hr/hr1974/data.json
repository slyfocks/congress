    "text": "Western States Energy Consumer Protection Act of 2001 - Instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue orders which make applicable to all interstate public utility electric energy sales in the western energy market a specified State of California market monitoring and mitigation plan that is based upon competitive bids to replicate competitive pricing.Authorizes termination of such plan if the Secretary of Energy determines that it results in decreased supply or increased demand for electric energy within the territory encompassed by the Western States Coordinating Council.Directs FERC to require a vendor of bundled natural gas transported into the State of California to disclose that portion of the sale price attributable to: (1) the price paid by the seller for such gas; and (2) the price paid for transportation of the gas.Precludes FERC and the Secretary from requiring sales of electric energy or natural gas in any State in the western region without a reasonable assurance of payment.Authorizes a State public utility commission in the western energy market to prohibit electric energy sales outside the service area of the pertinent public utility if that would impair the ability of such utility to meet in-State demand.Amends the Federal Power Act to prescribe guidelines to accelerate the effective date of FERC-ordered wholesale rate refunds."
