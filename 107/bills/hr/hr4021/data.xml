  <summary>3/20/2002--Introduced.
Small Business Health Insurance Relief Act of 2002 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make incentive payments to States that provide uninsured employees health insurance coverage as part of an approved waiver application under the Social Security Act (where States are permitted to use Medicaid program or State children's health insurance program (SCHIP) funds for experimental projects).Requires that such health insurance coverage be provided: (1) without regard to health status, preexisting condition, or location of residency within a State; (2) through employer-sponsored health insurance or by buying into Medicaid or SCHIP; (3) at a specified level of actuarial equivalence; and (4) for a nominal amount of an employee's income.Limits eligibility to lawful U.S. residents (and their spouses and dependents) who are otherwise not entitled to benefits under the Medicaid or SCHIP and are employed by a small business that does not offer affordable (or any) health insurance.</summary>
