Includes the spouse of the abducted child within such prohibition.Directs the Secretary of State to: (1) identify inadmissible aliens supporting child abductors and relatives of abductors; and (2) provide notice, upon request, to custodial parents and guardians if such an alien has been authorized to enter the United States.</summary>
