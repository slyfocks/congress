  <summary>5/24/2001--Introduced.
Hospital Medicare Payment Parity Act of 2001 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, where hospitals in one urban area are treated for geographical reclassification purposes as being located in another urban area, to calculate and apply the wage index for that one urban area as if the hospitals so treated had not been excluded from the calculation of such wage index (thus precluding it from being reduced by such treatment).</summary>
