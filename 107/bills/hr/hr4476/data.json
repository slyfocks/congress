Defines \"designated dental health professional shortage area\" to mean an area, population group, or facility that is designated by the Secretary as a dental health professional shortage area or designated by a State as having a dental health manpower shortage. Sets forth certain grant requirements.Directs the Secretary to develop and implement a plan for increasing the participation of dentists and dental hygienists in the National Health Service Corps' scholarship and loan repayment programs. Revises scholarship and loan repayment program requirements to allow periods of obligated service (period of time that a recipient must serve in a health professional shortage area in order to receive a scholarship or loan) to be served and fulfilled on a part-time basis if certain conditions are met.Sets forth requirements with respect to the dental health professional shortage area designation process."
