  <summary>7/17/2001--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants for the establishment of regional plant genome and gene expression research and development centers to: (1) develop capabilities in basic plant genome research; (2) extend basic plant genomics research through plant breeding programs and accelerate its application to development and testing of new varieties of enhanced food crops and crops that can be used as alternative energy sources; (3) develop alternative uses of agricultural crops; and (4) serve as centers for scientific and safety information on plant genomics.</summary>
