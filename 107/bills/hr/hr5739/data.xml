  <summary>11/14/2002--Introduced.
Food Choking Prevention Act of 2002 - Directs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in collaboration with the Consumer Product Safety Commission to establish an Office of Choking Hazard Evaluation to require warning labels on food products primarily consumed by children that pose a demonstrably high choking risk to them.Grants the Office mandatory recall authority over food products determined to pose a significant and unacceptable choking hazard to the general public.Mandates establishment of a Choking Hazard Evaluation Task Force whose staff shall be designated jointly by such agencies to establish criteria for determining whether a food product poses a significant and unacceptable choking hazard, using age-differentiated criteria for choking hazards.Directs the FDA to: (1) establish a national database of unusual food choking incidents; and (2) provide for an adequate reporting system throughout its field offices, which members of the health care profession and the general public can readily access to report new incidents.</summary>
