Revises eligibility requirements with respect to such grants.Limits the Federal share of cost of construction of a nonapproach control tower to no more $1.1 million.(Sec. 4) Authorizes the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to enter into a lease agreement or contract agreement with a private entity to provide for construction and operation of a nonapproach control tower. Sets forth certain agreement terms and conditions.(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the feasibility, costs, and benefits of allowing an airport sponsor to use up to ten percent of airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning funds apportioned to it to pay the non-Federal share of the cost of operation of an air traffic control tower."
