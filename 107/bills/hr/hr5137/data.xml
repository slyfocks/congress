  <summary>7/16/2002--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of the Army, for purposes of shoreline protection and restoration, to dispose of dredged material from the construction, operation, or maintenance of a navigation project using a disposal method other than the least-cost disposal option if the Secretary determines that the additional cost of using the disposal method is justified by the benefits, including storm damage reduction, environmental, and recreation benefits. Requires disposal of dredged material to be initiated only upon the request of non-Federal interests and only after they have entered into a cooperative agreement to provide 35 percent of the costs associated with the disposal.</summary>
