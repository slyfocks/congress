Requires a physician who performs such an abortion to certify to the designated State agency the medical indications supporting the physician's judgement.Requires each State to enact legislation to assure that its licensing body may take appropriate disciplinary action against a physician who violates this Act, including authority to refuse to admit to examination or to issue a license or license renewal to a violator of this Act.</summary>
