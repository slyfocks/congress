  <summary>2/27/2001--Introduced.
Humanitarian Exports Leading to Peace Act of 2001 - Declares that certain sanctions prohibiting trade with Iraq under the Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990 or any other provision of law shall not apply with respect to the export of any food or other agricultural products (including fertilizer), medicines, medical supplies, medical instruments, or medical equipment, or with respect to travel incident to the sale or delivery of such items.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to exercise the authorities of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (as in effect pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act) to carry out this Act; except that the Secretary may not require a license for the export of humanitarian assistance, but shall require persons to notify the Secretary when exporting such assistance.Amends the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 to repeal a specified section prohibiting the export to Iraq of agricultural commodities (including the financing of their sale), medicine, or medical devices, and travel (effectively allowing the export of such commodities and travel to such country).Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. Government should take all necessary steps to end the suffering of innocent populations, primarily children and the elderly, by allowing the free flow of humanitarian aid to Iraq without threat of prosecution. Urges the U.S. Government to use its position as a permanent member of the United Nations (UN) Security Council to lift the economic sanctions on Iraq so as to allow such exports and travel there, and to recommend a ban on transfers of weapons to such country by countries that are members of the UN.</summary>
