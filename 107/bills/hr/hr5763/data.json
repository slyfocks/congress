Permits the Tax Court to apply the doctrine of equitable recoupment to the same extent as in other Federal courts. Limits the right to appeal a levy determination to the Tax Court (currently, a U.S. district court may have jurisdiction).Provides a 15-day delay in due date for electronically filed individual income tax returns.Revises confidentiality requirements concerning: (1) the disclosure upon oral request of either spouse of collection activities with respect to a joint return; (2) compliance by contractors; (3) standards for requests for and consents to disclosure; and (3) notice to taxpayer of an administrative determination that a return was unlawfully inspected; and (4) expanded disclosure in emergency circumstances.Makes additional miscellaneous amendments including: (1) requiring an evaluation of alternative, technological means of communicating with taxpayers; (2) authorizing regulations for the conduct of enrolled agents; (3) charging fees to the IRS by the Financial Management Service; and (4) procedures concerning Treasury auctions.Revises penalty and interest provisions concerning the treatment of penalties for failure by an individual to pay estimated income tax (converted to interest charge). Excludes interest on overpayments of tax from gross income. Abates interest on all erroneous refunds. Waives certain penalties for first-time unintentional minor errors. Revises and increases the penalty for filing a frivolous tax return."
