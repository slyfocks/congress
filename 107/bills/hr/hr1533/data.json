Requires: (1) the defendant to be tested within 24 hours after the later of the date the information or indictment is presented or the time of the victim's request; (2) the test results to be confidential, with exceptions; and (3) the results to be made available as soon as practicable to the victim and to the defendant (or legal guardian, if the defendant is a minor). Requires: (1) the defendant to undergo any appropriate follow-up tests; (2) those test results to be made immediately available to the victim; and (3) if test results indicate that the defendant has HIV, such fact may be considered in the judicial proceedings conducted for the crime.Authorizes: (1) a State to restrict the victim's disclosure of the defendant's test results to third parties as a condition of making such results available to the victim; (2) funds reduced for noncompliance to be redistributed to complying States; and (3) grants for programs to test defendants for HIV disease."
