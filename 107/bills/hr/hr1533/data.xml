  <summary>4/4/2001--Introduced.
Victims of Rape Health Protection Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to reduce by ten percent the funds available to a State under the drug control (Byrne) grant program unless such State requires that the defendant be tested for HIV if the nature of the crime would have placed the victim at risk of HIV and the victim requests the test. Requires: (1) the defendant to be tested within 24 hours after the later of the date the information or indictment is presented or the time of the victim's request; (2) the test results to be confidential, with exceptions; and (3) the results to be made available as soon as practicable to the victim and to the defendant (or legal guardian, if the defendant is a minor). Requires: (1) the defendant to undergo any appropriate follow-up tests; (2) those test results to be made immediately available to the victim; and (3) if test results indicate that the defendant has HIV, such fact may be considered in the judicial proceedings conducted for the crime.Authorizes: (1) a State to restrict the victim's disclosure of the defendant's test results to third parties as a condition of making such results available to the victim; (2) funds reduced for noncompliance to be redistributed to complying States; and (3) grants for programs to test defendants for HIV disease.</summary>
