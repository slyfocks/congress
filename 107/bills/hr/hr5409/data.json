States that it is anticipated that this Act will make it unnecessary to construct regional transmission lines through heavily populated lands in the Temecula Valley.Subjects the right-of-way to such terms and conditions as the Secretaries set forth to protect historic, cultural, and natural resources under their respective jurisdictions."
