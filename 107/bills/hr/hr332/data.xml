Aviation Consumer Right To Know Act of 2001 - Amends Federal aviation law to require an air carrier, upon the request of any person (including a governmental entity), to: (1) provide the person full access to all air transportation fares it provides, regardless of the technology the person uses to access the fares; and (2) permit the person to purchase air transportation at any published fare.Requires any announcement by an air carrier of a delay or cancellation of a flight, a diversion of a flight to an airport other than the airport at which the flight is scheduled to land, or a delay in deplaning at an airport, to include an explanation of the reason for such delay, cancellation, or diversion and, in the case of a delay, its expected length. Prohibits an air carrier from providing false or misleading explanations.Prohibits an air carrier from: (1) prohibiting a person (including governmental entity) that purchases air transportation from only using a portion of the air transportation purchased (including using the air transportation purchased only for one-way travel instead of round-trip travel); and (2) assessing an additional fee or charge to the person, or any ticket agent that sold the air transportation to such person.Requires an air carrier, upon the request of any person (including a governmental entity), to disclose the number or percentage of seats that the carrier intends to make available on a specific date for use by a person redeeming an award under a frequent flyer program.Prohibits an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent from selling air transportation in the United States for a flight on which an insecticide is planned to be used while passengers are on board the aircraft, unless such carrier or ticket agent first informs the purchaser of the insecticide's use, including its name.</summary>
