    "text": "DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2002 - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) survey each law enforcement jurisdiction to assess the backlog of DNA testing of rape kit samples and other sexual assault evidence; and (2) make grants to eligible entities to carry out sexual assault examiner training and certification, develop sexual assault examiner programs, acquire or improve forensic equipment, and train law enforcement personnel in the handling of sexual assault cases.Amends the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 to: (1) ensure that DNA testing and analysis of samples from rape kits and non-suspect cases are carried out in a timely manner; (2) reauthorize grants; (3) authorize local governments to apply for and receive grants; (4) direct the Attorney General to give priority in awarding grants to a State or local governmental unit that has a significant rape kit or non-suspect case backlog; (5) expand the scope of DNA samples subject to privacy protections; and (6) authorize appropriations to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the collection and use of DNA identification information from certain Federal offenders.Amends: (1) the Federal criminal code and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to authorize \"John Doe\" DNA indictments for sexual abuse (allows describing a person as an unknown individual who has a particular DNA profile if the identity of the accused or defendant is unknown); and (2) the DNA Identification Act of 1994 to authorize appropriations to the FBI to carry out a redesign of the Combined DNA Index System."
