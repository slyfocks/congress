    "text": "Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Act of 2001 - Declares that it shall be policy of the United States that its research, development, demonstration, and commercial applications programs be designed to enable 20 percent of domestic energy generated from stationary sources to be generated from nonhydropower renewable energy sources by the year 2020.Prescribes research and development program goals to implement such policy in connection with enhanced: (1) energy efficiency; (2) renewable energy; and (3) biomass energy and related chemical research.Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) submit to Congress an assessment of renewable energy resources available for commercial application; (2) commission an independent assessment of innovative financing techniques to facilitate construction of new renewable energy and energy efficiency facilities that might not otherwise be built in a competitive market; (3) provide assistance to private sector entities for the commercial application of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies; and (4) establish an education and outreach program on renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.Directs the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to seek to develop: (1) technologies that will enable a 50 percent increase in aircraft engine energy efficiencies by 2010; and (2) air transportation management operational concepts and procedures that will enable a 25 percent increase in the energy efficiency of the overall air transport system on a per flight basis by 2010.Requires the Director of the Office and Science and Technology Policy to oversee a review of each Federal agency's regulations and policies for emerging renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies and processes."
