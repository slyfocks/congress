Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 - Title I: Commodity Programs - Subtitle A: Direct Payments and Counter-Cyclical Payments - (Sec. 1101) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), for purposes of making direct and counter-cyclical payments, to give a farm owner the opportunity to elect one of four base acre calculation methods which shall apply to all covered commodities (wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, and other oilseeds) on a farm. Identifies the applicable method for nonelection. Provides for base acre adjustment upon conservation reserve contract termination or acreage release. Authorizes an owner to permanently reduce a commodity's base acres.(Sec. 1102) Directs the Secretary to establish payment yields for each farm for each covered commodity. States that: (1) the yield shall be the payment yield in effect for the 2002 crop of the commodity; or (2) if no yield is available the Secretary shall establish an appropriate payment yield based upon similar yields in the area.Directs the Secretary to establish soybean and other oilseed yields for a farm by determining the average yield from 1998 through 2001, excluding years where the planted oilseed acreage was zero.Sets forth crop acreage base and payment yield update provisions.(Sec. 1103) Directs the Secretary to make direct payments for FY 2002 through 2007. Sets forth payment rates for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybeans, and other oilseeds.

Authorizes up to 50 percent in advance payments.(Sec. 1104) Directs the Secretary to make counter-cyclical payments for crop years 2002 through 2007 whenever the effective rate is less than the target price. States that the effective price shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the higher of the national average market price during the 12-month marketing year for the commodity or the national average loan rate for the commodity, and (2) the direct payment rate for the commodity. Authorizes partial payments.Sets forth covered commodity target prices for: (1) crop years 2002 and 2003; and (2) crop years 2004 through 2007. States that: (1) the payment rate for counter-cyclical payments shall be equal to: (1) the difference between the target price and the effective price for the commodity; and (2) the payment amount for such payments shall be equal to the product of the payment rate, acreage, and yield.(Sec. 1105) Sets forth contract elements. Provides for: (1) tenant and sharecropper protection; and (2) equitable contract payment sharing among eligible producers.(Sec. 1106) Permits planting flexibility on base acres, with exceptions for tree-or perennial-grown fruits, most vegetables, and wild rice, unless the base acreage commodity is destroyed before harvest.(Sec. 1107) Terminates the Secretary's authority to make production flexibility contract payments on the date of the enactment of this Act, unless requested by the producer. Reduces any direct payments due a producer by any FY 2002 payments made under a production flexibility contract.(Sec. 1108) Makes the provisions of this subtitle effective through crop year 2007.Subtitle B: Marketing Assistance Loans and Loan Deficiency Payments - (Sec. 1201) Directs the Secretary to make nonrecourse marketing assistance loans to producers of specified commodities through crop year 2007. Requires producers to comply with appropriate conservation and wetland provisions.Directs the Secretary to make loans to a producer with covered commodities commingled in an unlicensed storage facility if the producer agrees to immediately redeem the loan collateral.Terminates FY 2002 marketing loan assistance under the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIRA).(Sec. 1202) Sets forth crop year 2002 through 2003 and 2004 through 2007 loan rates for: (1) wheat; (2) corn; (3) grain sorghum; (4) barley; (5) oats; (6) upland cotton; (7) extra long staple cotton; (8) rice; (9) soybeans; (10) other oilseeds; (11) graded wool; (12) nongraded wool; (13) honey; (14) dry peas; (15) lentils; (16) small chickpeas; and (17) mohair.(Sec. 1203) Provides for a market loan term of nine months with no extensions.(Sec. 1204) Permits producers of wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, soybeans, other oilseeds, dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, wool, mohair, and honey to repay marketing assistance loans at the lesser of: (1) the loan rate for the commodity plus interest; or (2) a loan rate that will minimize forfeitures, accumulation of stocks, storage costs, allow competitive marketing, and minimize State and county discrepancies.Permits producers of: (1) upland cotton and rice to repay marketing assistance loans at a rate that is the lesser of the loan rate for the commodity plus interest, or the prevailing world market price (adjusted to U.S. quality and location); and (2) extra long staple cotton to repay marketing assistance loans at the loan rate plus interest.(Sec. 1205) Directs the Secretary to make loan deficiency payments to producers who, although eligible for a marketing assistance loan, agree to forgo a loan in favor of receiving a payment. Authorizes loan deficiency payments for unshorn pelts, hay, or silage derived from a loan commodity.States that: (1) the loan deficiency payment shall be the product of the payment rate and the quantity of the loan commodity produced, excluding any commodity for which the producer obtained a loan; and (2) the payment rate shall be the amount by which the loan rate exceeds the repayment rate.
