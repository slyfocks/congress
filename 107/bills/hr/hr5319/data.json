Requires: (1) plaintiffs to file causes of action within 15 days of publication of notice of final agency action, after which the Secretary concerned shall stay the project until completion of judicial review; and (2) Federal district courts to decide the merits of an action within 60 days, with extensions under specified circumstances.(Sec. 10) Requires General Accounting Office audits of this Act's implementation.(Sec. 11) Authorizes through September 30, 2005: (1) the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into not more than 15 stewardship and end result contracts for hazardous fuels reduction projects; and (2) the Secretary of the Interior to enter into not more than 26 such projects, other than revested Oregon and California Railroad and reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road grant lands.(Sec. 12) States that the processes established by this Act shall be available through September 30, 2005.(Sec. 13) States that this Act shall not be construed to affect: (1) litigation involving the Roadless Area Conservation Rule; or (2) the authority of the Secretaries to implement hazardous fuel reduction projects under other available authorities on any Federal lands.(Sec. 14) States that the Secretary concerned shall complete hazardous fuels reduction projects on Federal lands consistent with the implementation plan for the ``Collaborative 10-year Strategy for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment,'' (dated May 2002).(Sec. 15) Directs the Secretaries to jointly establish an independent monitoring panel.(Sec. 16) Authorizes related appropriations for: (1) National Forest System lands; and (2) Bureau of Land Management lands."
