  <summary>12/20/2001--Introduced.
Amends the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999 to extend the definition of a steel company qualified for a loan guarantee to one that has placed on hot idle status any steel mill facilities used in steel production or manufacture.Increases the individual guarantee limit under the loan guarantee program.Requires the Loan Guarantee Board to utilize a form of unconditional and unqualified guarantee that U.S. commercial banks would typically require from a nongovernmental guarantor in a similar commercial loan transaction.Revises loan guarantee requirements to: (1) replace "reasonable assurance" of loan repayment with "fair likelihood" of repayment; and (2) include a Board determination that the applicant company's business plan maximizes job retention and capacity consistent with its long-term economic viability.Repeals the requirement that loan securities be guaranteed. Authorizes the Board, in lieu of such requirement, to: (1) require security in either existing or after-acquired assets for the guaranteed portion of the loan; and (2) provide the unguaranteed portion of the loan different payment preference or different terms than those provided to the guaranteed portion of the loan.Increases the maximum principal loan amount to be guaranteed from 85 percent to 95 percent, plus the amount of any unpaid interest on the loan.</summary>
