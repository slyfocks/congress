Requires such ownership interest to be a fee interest requiring full repayment. Defines \"first-time homebuyer\" as an individual on whose behalf an individual retirement plan is established (eligible participant) or a family member (child, parent, or grandparent) who had no present ownership interest in a principal residence during the two-year period before the date of the arrangement.Allows the use of amounts in an individual retirement plan to make loans of up to $10,000 to purchase a home for a first-time homebuyer on behalf of an eligible participant or a family member. Prohibits a related interest deduction."
