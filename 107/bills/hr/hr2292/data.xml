No Safe Haven in Cuba Act - Expresses congressional findings that on May 2, 1973, Joanne Chesimard and two companions opened fire on two New Jersey State Troopers, killing Trooper Werner Foerster; that Ms. Chesimard was found guilty of first-degree murder; that she escaped from the reformatory and fled to Cuba; and that approximately 90 other individuals have fled to Cuba after indictment for or conviction of serious offenses.Amends the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 to require that, in order to determine that a democratically elected government exists in Cuba, the government prove its respect for the democratic rule of law by ceasing to provide a safe harbor to individuals who have been legally indicted or convicted of serious offenses, including Joanne Chesimard and all others who have fled from the United States to Cuba for the sole purpose of avoiding prosecution or confinement for serious criminal offenses committed in the United States.</summary>
