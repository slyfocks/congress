    "text": "Work Opportunity and Relief Compensation Act - Sets forth health insurance coverage options for recently unemployed individuals and their families. Requires establishment of a temporary program under which 75 percent of the premium for COBRA continuation coverage shall be provided for an individual who: (1) at any time between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2002, is separated from employment; and (2) is eligible for, and has elected, COBRA continuation coverage. (COBRA refers to title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, and concerns continuing post-employment employee group health plan coverage under specified provisions of the Public Health Service Act, the Internal Revenue Code, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of1974.) Permits a State to elect to provide temporary Medicaid coverage (under title XIX of the Social Security Act) for individuals who: (1) are separated from employment at any time between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2002; (2) are not eligible for COBRA continuation coverage; (3) are not insured; and (4) do not have assets, resources, and earned or unearned income that exceed limitations set by the State. Permits a State to pay the entire COBRA premium for certain low-income individuals.Includes in the optional Medicaid eligibility category for such illnesses Indian women with breast or cervical cancer who are eligible for health services under a medical care program of the Indian Health Service or of a tribal organization. Increases the allowed Federal Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotment in extremely low-DSH States. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services, for a certain period, from implementing any modification to upper payment limits for services furnished by non-State government-owned or operated hospitals. Revises the transitional medical assistance (TMA) program to give States the option to: (1) waive notice and reporting requirements; (2) extend eligibility period for low-income individuals; (3) allow families to receive TMA if they have received Medicaid for fewer than three of the preceding six months; and (4) not comply with certain TMA requirements if coverage is extended to certain low-income families.Temporary Unemployment Compensation Act of 2001 - Provides for a program of temporary supplemental unemployment compensation. Includes among eligibility requirements an individual's not having rights, with respect to a week, to other compensation (excluding extended compensation). Applies program agreements to weeks of unemployment: (1) beginning after the date on which such an agreement is entered into; and (2) ending before January 1, 2003."
