  <summary>12/20/2001--Introduced.
Repeals specific legislation that establishes it as a misdemeanor crime to import goods at less than market value with the intent of harming a domestic industry and that allows as recourse an injured party to sue violators in a district court for triple damages and the cost of bringing suit. Decrees no court judgment pertaining to such cases shall be valid after September 26, 2000, the effective date a World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body found the legislation to be against WTO rules.</summary>
