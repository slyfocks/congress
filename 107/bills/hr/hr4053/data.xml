  <summary>3/20/2002--Introduced.
Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to authorize a court to declare an election void upon a finding that a violation of election procedural requirements under the Act may have substantially understated or overstated the support of one of the candidates for office in a labor organization to the point that the democratic purposes of the election were undermined. (Replaces the current criterion that such violation may have affected the election outcome.)</summary>
