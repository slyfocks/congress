Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to: (1) increase the maximum percentage of Federal contributions allowed with respect to the cost of hazard mitigation measures in any area affected by a major disaster; and (2) increase such Federal share if the State has in effect an approved mitigation plan.Directs the Secretary and the Director of FEMA to: (1) develop, and annually update, rank, and list authorized flood damage reduction and predisaster hazard mitigation projects according to the extent to which projects address repetitive loss structures, include nonstructural features, and restore natural rivers and floodplain; and (2) annually publish such list in the Federal Register."
