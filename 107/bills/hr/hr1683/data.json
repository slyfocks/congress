Regulates frequency and cost sharing. Prohibits related denial of coverage, incentives to individuals, restrictions on provider-patient communications, and provider penalties. Allows State laws providing greater detection or prevention benefits. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply the above requirements to coverage offered in the individual market."
