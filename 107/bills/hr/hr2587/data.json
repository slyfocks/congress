    "text": "Energy Advancement and Conservation Act of 2001 - Title I: Energy Conservation Subtitle A: Reauthorization of Federal Energy Conservation Programs - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to reauthorize through FY 2006 specified Federal Energy Conservation Programs including: (1) promotion of export of energy efficient products; (2) energy conservation standards for new buildings; (3) the Federal Energy Management Program; (4) energy efficient lighting and building centers; (5) energy efficiency labeling for windows and window systems; (6) energy efficiency for commercial office equipment; (7) energy efficiency information for luminaires; (8) energy efficiency in industrial facilities; and (9) process-oriented industrial energy efficiency.Subtitle B: Federal Leadership in Energy Conservation - Expands the purposes of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NEPCA) to include Federal Government promotion of production, supply, and marketing of energy efficiency products and services, and the production, supply, and marketing of unconventional and renewable energy resources.(Sec. 121) Revises energy performance requirements for Federal buildings through FY 2020.Authorizes appropriations through FY 2010 for studies by the Secretary of Energy (Secretary) to identify and encourage production and marketing of energy efficiency products and services, and of unconventional and renewable energy resources.Prescribes implementation guidelines for: (1) Federal agency acquisition of only Energy Star products when purchasing energy-using products; and (2) metering and submetering of all energy-using Federal buildings (including buildings owned by the legislative and judicial branch).Requires each Federal agency to conduct energy management reviews and to implement measures to achieve the potential efficiency and renewable savings identified in such reviews.(Sec. 122) Revises the meaning of cost savings in Federal Energy Savings Performance Contracts. Treats reduction in the cost of water and replacement facilities as energy savings. Requires a Federal agency to engage in contracting and auditing to implement energy savings performance contracts to ensure compliance with the energy efficiency requirements of this Act.(Sec. 123) Authorizes a utility incentive program to include a contract or contract term designed to provide for cost-effective electricity demand management, energy efficiency, or water conservation.Encourages Federal agencies to participate in State or regional demand side reduction programs, including those operated by wholesale market institutions such as independent system operators, and regional transmission organizations.(Sec. 124) Mandates Federal agency compliance with specified efficiency standards governing air conditioners and heat pumps.(Sec. 125) Establishes the Federal Energy Bank as a trust fund in the Treasury to: (1) receive mandatory Federal agency deposits equal to a specified percentage of the total utility payments paid by each agency in the preceding fiscal year; and (2) finance a loan program administered by the Secretary for certain energy efficiency projects and energy metering plans.(Sec. 126) Directs the Secretary to establish an Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed program to develop, test, and demonstrate advanced engineering systems, components, and materials to enable innovations in building technologies.(Sec. 127) Mandates: (1) Federal agency use of interval consumption data that measure real time electricity consumption in Federal buildings; (2) a review of the Federal Energy Savings Performance Contracts program to identify obstacles that prevent Federal agencies from fully utilizing it; and (3) an evaluation of the Capitol Complex energy infrastructure to determine how it could be augmented to become more energy efficient, using unconventional and renewable energy resources, so as to enable the Complex to have reliable utility service in the event of power fluctuations, shortages, or outages.Subtitle C: State Programs - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary at least once every three years to invite the Governor of each State to: (1) review and revise, if necessary, the State energy conservation plan, taking into consideration the energy conservation plans of other States within the region; and (2) identify opportunities and actions implemented in pursuit of common energy conservation goals.
