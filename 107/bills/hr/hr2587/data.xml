Treats reduction in the cost of water and replacement facilities as energy savings. Requires a Federal agency to engage in contracting and auditing to implement energy savings performance contracts to ensure compliance with the energy efficiency requirements of this Act.(Sec. 123) Authorizes a utility incentive program to include a contract or contract term designed to provide for cost-effective electricity demand management, energy efficiency, or water conservation.Encourages Federal agencies to participate in State or regional demand side reduction programs, including those operated by wholesale market institutions such as independent system operators, and regional transmission organizations.(Sec. 124) Mandates Federal agency compliance with specified efficiency standards governing air conditioners and heat pumps.(Sec. 125) Establishes the Federal Energy Bank as a trust fund in the Treasury to: (1) receive mandatory Federal agency deposits equal to a specified percentage of the total utility payments paid by each agency in the preceding fiscal year; and (2) finance a loan program administered by the Secretary for certain energy efficiency projects and energy metering plans.(Sec. 126) Directs the Secretary to establish an Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed program to develop, test, and demonstrate advanced engineering systems, components, and materials to enable innovations in building technologies.(Sec. 127) Mandates: (1) Federal agency use of interval consumption data that measure real time electricity consumption in Federal buildings; (2) a review of the Federal Energy Savings Performance Contracts program to identify obstacles that prevent Federal agencies from fully utilizing it; and (3) an evaluation of the Capitol Complex energy infrastructure to determine how it could be augmented to become more energy efficient, using unconventional and renewable energy resources, so as to enable the Complex to have reliable utility service in the event of power fluctuations, shortages, or outages.Subtitle C: State Programs - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary at least once every three years to invite the Governor of each State to: (1) review and revise, if necessary, the State energy conservation plan, taking into consideration the energy conservation plans of other States within the region; and (2) identify opportunities and actions implemented in pursuit of common energy conservation goals. Requires State energy plans contain a specified energy efficiency improvement goal.(Sec. 132) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) State energy conservation plans (through FY 2005); (2) the energy conservation program for schools and hospitals (through FY 2010); (3) the weatherization assistance program (through FY 2005); and (4) the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program (through FY 2005).(Sec. 135) Establishes in DOE the High Performance Public Buildings Program for energy efficiency assistance grants to local government units.Subtitle D: Energy Efficiency for Consumer Products - Establishes an Energy Star program at DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify and promote energy-efficient products and buildings in order to reduce energy consumption, improve energy security, and reduce pollution through labeling of products and buildings that meet the highest energy efficiency standards. Divides implementation responsibilities between DOE and EPA, and directs each to: (1) promote Energy Star compliant technologies as the preferred technologies for achieving energy efficiency and pollution reduction; (2) work to enhance public awareness of the Energy Star label; (3) preserve the integrity of the Energy Star label; and (4) determine whether the Energy Star label should be extended to certain additional products and buildings.(Sec. 142) Directs the Secretary to make recommendations to the Federal Trade Commission about labeling of certain consumer products that is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and is technologically and economically feasible.(Sec. 143) Prohibits household appliances from consuming more than one watt of standby mode electric energy.
