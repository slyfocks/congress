  <summary>5/15/2001--Introduced.
Instructs the Secretary of Energy to study and report to Congress on areas where Federal regulations may be modified to help alleviate ongoing gasoline price pressures, including the potential for: (1) improvements related to increased costs resulting from the high number of "boutique" fuel formulations produced in the United States; (2) decrease of refining costs through changes in fuel Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) requirements; (3) cost savings through regulatory changes related to the transition from winter to summer fuel mixes; and (4) any other areas that the Secretary believes that regulations could be streamlined or improved to alleviate high fuel prices.</summary>
