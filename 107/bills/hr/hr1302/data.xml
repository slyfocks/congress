  <summary>3/29/2001--Introduced.
United Nations Voting Accountability Act of 2001 - Prohibits U.S. assistance to any country that consistently opposed the U.S. position in the United Nations General Assembly during its most recent session. Authorizes the Secretary of State to exempt a country from such prohibition: (1) if there has been a fundamental change in its government policies; and (2) the Secretary believes that because of such change the country will no longer oppose the U.S. position in the General Assembly. Directs the Secretary to make a certification of each exemption to Congress. Authorizes the Secretary to waive the requirements of this Act if the Secretary reports to Congress that, despite the UN voting pattern of a particular country, U.S. assistance to such country is necessary to promote U.S. foreign policy objectives.</summary>
