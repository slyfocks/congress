  <summary>5/23/2001--Introduced.
Terminates the entitlement to educational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve on the date the member is separated from the Reserve. (Currently, such termination is the earlier of two conditional dates.) Provides a conditional date of such entitlement for a Selected Reserve member who ceases to be such a member during a ten-year period beginning on October 1, 1991, due to Reserve unit deactivation or the involuntary cessation of such Reserve member designation.</summary>
