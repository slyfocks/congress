National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act of 2001 - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA), acting through the Associate Administrator for Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), to establish a pilot program to provide regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses through participating SBDCs, the Association for Small Business Development Centers (Association), and Federal compliance partnership programs. Requires the Administrator to enter into arrangements with participating SBDCs to provide: (1) access to regulatory information and resources; (2) training and education activities; (3) confidential counseling to owners and operators of small businesses regarding compliance with Federal and State regulations; (4) technical assistance; and (5) referrals to experts and other providers of compliance assistance. Requires each SBDC to transmit quarterly reports to the Administrator that include: (1) summaries of the regulatory compliance assistance provided; and (2) any data and information obtained from a Federal agency regarding regulatory compliance that the agency intends to be disseminated to small business concerns.Directs the Administrator to: (1) act as the repository of and clearinghouse for data and information submitted by SBDCs; and (2) transmit to the President and the congressional small business committees annual reports on assistance provided, including data and information on cases in which one or more SBDCs offered conflicting information on compliance with a Federal or State regulation, any recommendations for improvements in the regulation of small business concerns, and a list of regulations identified as being most burdensome to such concerns and recommendations to reduce or eliminate the burdens.Provides that only certified SBDCs shall be eligible to receive assistance. Permits the waiver of such requirement if the SBDC is making a good faith effort to obtain certification.Requires the Administrator, giving substantial weight to the Association's recommendations, to select the SBDC programs of two States from each of ten groups of States for participation in the pilot program. Makes each State program selected eligible to receive a grant of at least $200,000 based on the relative populations of States selected.Directs the Comptroller General to conduct an evaluation of the pilot program and transmit to the Administrator and the small business committees a report containing the results along with any recommendations as to whether such program should be extended to include the participation of all SBDCs.Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Small Business Act to prescribe privacy requirements applicable to SBDCs.</summary>
