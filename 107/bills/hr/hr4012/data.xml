  <summary>3/20/2002--Introduced.
Rural Wireless Telecommunications Consumer Enhancement Act of 2002 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in adopting rules that apply to small rural wireless carriers (carriers with fewer than one percent of the Nation's wireless subscribers), to separately evaluate the burden that any proposed regulatory, compliance, or reporting requirement would have on such carriers. Requires forbearance in the imposition of any requirement that would cause such carriers to divert resources from improving existing and advanced services, making infrastructure investments, and undertaking other initiatives for the benefit of businesses and residents in rural areas, so long as such forbearance is in the public interest.Requires the FCC to act within 90 days on a petition from such a carrier for reconsideration or other review of an FCC rule, policy, or other requirement.Establishes in the FCC an Office of Rural Advocacy to undertake specified activities with respect to the promotion and provision of wireless telecommunications services for rural populations.</summary>
