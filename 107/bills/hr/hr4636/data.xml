  <summary>5/1/2002--Introduced.
Workers' Bill of Rights - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to add provisions relating to: (1) an employer's recognition of a labor organization as representative of workers for collective bargaining and other purposes; (2) limitation on dues collection; (3) membership right to vote on a contract before a strike is called; (4) penalties for causing recognition of an unelected labor organization; (5) secret ballot election; (6) the lifting of a bar against an election once an existing contract has been in effect for one year or more; (7) majority deauthorization of union security agreements; and (8) enforcement of limits on dues agreements.Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to include coverage of employers, or groups or associations of employers, that receive Federal funds. Gives employees who are not union members, but who are core dues payers, the same right as any union member to participate in any vote that concerns a strike or wages, benefits, or working conditions. Revises provisions relating to availability of information. Allows a trusteeship (for authorization control of a union) to be authorized only after a fair hearing either before the executive board or another body provided by the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization. Requires a labor organization to show by clear and convincing proof that the continuation of the trusteeship is necessary for an allowable purpose.Amends the Clayton Act to provide that nothing shall make it lawful for any two or more labor organizations to enter into an agreement that restrains an employee's ability to select a collecting bargaining representative.</summary>
