Forbids the leasing, sale, or exchange of such lands or the sale, removal, or destruction of any resource from such lands, including timber and minerals.Requires that all roads on Federal public lands be inventoried, with unnecessary ones to be obliterated and revegetated. Directs the Federal agencies having jurisdiction over Federal public lands to inventory them by acre, roads, rivers, and streams by mile. States that such inventory shall include a recommendation of what can be done to restore natural conditions on the lands.Declares fires, insects, disease, and other natural destructive forces on Federal public lands to be considered acts of nature, with no further attempts to correct for them permitted.Allows any citizen harmed by a violation of this Act to bring suit in any district court of the United States. Permits the court to impose damages for findings of violation.Sets forth that the United States (including its agents and employees) waives its sovereign immunity in all respects in all actions with regard to court proceedings under this Act."
