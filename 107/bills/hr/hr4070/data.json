Defines misuse of benefits as occurring when a representative payee receives payment for the use and benefit of another person or of another qualified individual and uses any part of it other than for the use and benefit of such person or qualified individual. Excludes reissued benefits from an individual's resources.(Sec. 102) Requires non-governmental representative payees to certify annually that they are bonded and State-licensed.Directs the Commissioner to: (1) provide for the periodic onsite review of certain representative payees; and (2) report to Congress on the number of cases in which a representative payee was changed and the number of times in which a misuse of funds was discovered.(Sec. 103) Forbids a prospective representative payee from receiving anyone's title II, VIII, or XVI benefit if the prospective representative payee: (1) has been convicted of any offense under Federal or State law resulting in imprisonment for more than one year (unless the Commissioner deems such payment would be appropriate notwithstanding such conviction); (2) is a person fleeing prosecution, custody, or confinement for a felony; or (3) is violating probation or parole. Forbids a fugitive felon from serving as a representative payee.Directs the Commissioner to evaluate and report to specified congressional committees on whether the existing procedures and reviews for the qualification and disqualification of representative payees are sufficient to guard against misuse of benefits.(Sec. 104) Prohibits a representative payee from collecting a fee for services under titles II and XVI for any month if the Commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative payee has misused any amount of a benefit for such month. Declares that any amount so collected by a representative payee shall be counted as a misused part of the benefit.(Sec. 105) Provides that a representative payee that is not a Federal, State, or local government agency will be held liable for misuse of funds collected under titles II, VIII, and XVI, and that any misused amount recovered by the Commissioner shall be refunded to the beneficiary or the alternative representative payee.(Sec. 106) Permits the Commissioner to require a representative payee to receive payments at the local Social Security field office if such representative has failed to furnish an annual report or a report requested by the Commissioner.Subtitle B: Enforcement - Provides that each misuse of benefits under titles II, VIII and XVI by a representative payee shall be punishable by a civil penalty of up to $5,000, as well as an assessment of not more than twice the value of any misused payments.Title II: Program Protections - Directs the Commissioner, until a centralized computer file recording the date of information submission is in place, to issue a receipt to the beneficiary or representative each time such individual submits documentation or reports to the Commissioner on a change in status.(Sec. 202) Amends SSA title II to declare that an individual fleeing prosecution or confinement after conviction of an act or attempted act that constitutes a felony (in New Jersey, a high misdemeanor) shall not be allowed OASDI benefits. (The Commissioner currently can deny fugitive felons SSI benefits.) Allows the Commissioner to pay such withheld OASDI benefits for good cause shown. Forbids benefits for those violating probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.Requires the Commissioner to furnish any law enforcement officer with personal information about any beneficiary upon request if: (1) the beneficiary is fleeing prosecution or confinement, or violating a condition of probation or parole, and has information necessary for the officer to conduct his duties; and (2) the location or apprehension of the beneficiary is within the officer's duties.(Sec. 203) Amends SSA title XI to prohibit anyone from offering for a fee information provided free of charge by the Social Security Administration unless such individual makes clear that the information is available free of charge and complies with standards prescribed by the Commissioner regarding placement, visibility, and legibility of such notice. Specifies that such restriction does not apply to offers to serve as a claimant representative or to help prepare an individual's plan for achieving self-support.(Sec. 204) Amends SSA title II to permit the Commissioner to: (1) refuse to recognize as a representative payee or to disqualify as a representative payee already recognized any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar, or who has been disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or agency; and (2) refuse to recognize or to disqualify as a nonattorney representative any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which he or she was previously admitted to practice. Declares that a representative payee disqualified or suspended for collecting or receiving a fee in excess of the authorized amount: (1) shall be barred from serving again until full restitution to the claimant is made; and (2) may then be considered for reinstatement only under rules prescribed by the Commissioner.(Sec. 205) Amends SSA title XI to establish a fine of up to $5,000 and a prison sentence of not more than three years for using force or attempting to use force to obstruct or impede any SSA officer, employee, or contractor while carrying out their official activities.
