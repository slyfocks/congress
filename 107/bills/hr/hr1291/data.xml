  <summary>12/8/2001--Passed Senate amended.
Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2001 - Title I: Education Matters - Amends Federal provisions concerning the Montgomery GI Bill (educational assistance for veterans) to provide a graduated increase through FY 2004 in the rates of basic educational assistance.(Sec. 102) Allows an individual to elect to receive an accelerated lump-sum payment of such basic educational assistance.(Sec. 103) Allows eligible veterans to elect to receive accelerated payment of such assistance for education leading to employment in a high technology industry. Makes eligible those veterans who are: (1) enrolled in an approved program of education leading to such employment; and (2) charged tuition and fees which, on a monthly basis, exceed 200 percent of the monthly rate of basic educational assistance allowance otherwise payable. Makes such accelerated payment the lesser of: (1) 60 percent of the established charges for such education; or (2) the aggregate amount of basic educational assistance to which such veteran remains entitled. Revises provisions concerning determinations by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of an individual's enrollment, pursuit, and attendance under an approved program.(Sec. 104) Makes eligible for active-duty basic educational assistance individuals who: (1) as of December 31, 1989, were eligible for regular basic educational assistance; (2) were not on active duty on October 19, 1984; (3) reenlist or reenter on active duty after December 31, 1989; and (4) after July 1, 1985, either are released as a result of a reduction in force or serve at least three years of continuous active duty and are discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability, preexisting disability, for hardship, or for a physical or mental condition not characterized as a disability for the convenience of the Government if any such individual had completed at least 30 months of continuous active duty. Provides similar requirements with respect to members of the Selected Reserve, requiring at least two years of continuous active duty followed by at least four years of continuous satisfactory service in the Selected Reserve.(Sec. 105) Provides for the continuation after service of educational assistance allowances for persons called to active duty in support of or response to the national emergency declared by the President on September 14, 2001, including allowances paid under the Montgomery GI Bill, the veterans' educational assistance program, and the survivors' and dependents' educational assistance program.(Sec. 106) Increases as of October 1, 2001, the monthly rates of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance, including the rates for training in business or industry, correspondence courses, and special restorative training.(Sec. 107) Provides a delimiting period of ten years for the use of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance in the case of a survivor or dependent who derives his or her eligibility from a veteran: (1) with a permanent total service-connected disability; or (2) who dies from a service-connected disability.(Sec. 108) Includes within the definition of "educational institution" for purposes of provisions governing eligibility for Montgomery GI Bill educational assistance any private entity that offers a course or courses to fulfill requirements for a license or certification for employment in a high technology occupation.Title II: Compensation and Pension Matters - Repeals the 30-year manifestation period limitation, following service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict, required for veterans' disability benefits coverage for certain respiratory cancers.
