Allows the issue of such a permit for any flight that does not stop in such country if the right to perform such air transportation has been specifically granted by an applicable international agreement for both scheduled and charter service.Permits the Secretary of Transportation to exempt a foreign carrier from such prohibition only if no U.S. air carrier is willing and able to provide the equivalent air transportation at a commercially feasible price."
