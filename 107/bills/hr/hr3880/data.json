Excepts from this prohibition a capacity expanding project south of Canal Street and West of Broadway in Manhattan if the project is part of a lower Manhattan redevelopment plan subject to Federal and State environmental assessment requirements and any projected increases in transportation-related emissions are offset by corresponding reductions within the affected county, with best efforts made to achieve reductions from within the immediate area affected by the project's emissions."
