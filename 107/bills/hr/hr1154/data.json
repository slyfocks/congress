Permits individuals to petition for a Federal expungement order.Makes it a class B misdemeanor to release or to knowingly fail to expunge a reference or record required to be expunged by this Act. Allows the person arrested to respond to any inquiry as though the voidable arrest did not occur.Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to increase the percentage of funding under the drug control and system improvement (Byrne) grant program if a State has in effect a law which provides substantially similar expungement procedures, criminal penalties, and individual rights regarding voidable arrests."
