  <summary>6/13/2001--Introduced.
Commercial Truck Safety Pilot Program Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a three-year pilot program to improve commercial motor vehicle safety in the State of Maine. Requires the Secretary, during such period, to waive certain Federal vehicle weight limitations on certain combination vehicles weighing over 80,000 pounds using the Interstate System within Maine. Permits such vehicles that were permitted to use noninterstate Maine State highways under Maine vehicle weight laws as of the initiation date of the pilot program to use highways on the Interstate System in Maine even though they were not exempt from Federal vehicle weight limitations. Continues in effect certain Maine vehicle weight limitations with respect to certain vehicles that travel a specified section of the Maine Turnpike. Provides for the waiver to become permanent unless the Secretary determines it has resulted in an adverse impact on highway safety.</summary>
