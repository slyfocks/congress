    "text": "Transported Air Pollution Mitigation Act of 2001 - Amends the Clean Air Act to require States to submit for each area (an \"upwind area\") that causes or significantly contributes to a violation of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone in another (\"downwind\") area an implementation plan revision that requires the upwind area to either: (1) reduce ozone or precursor emissions by an amount necessary to mitigate impacts in the downwind area commensurate with the contribution of the upwind area; or (2) compensate the State or an air quality district in amounts necessary to pay costs of emission reduction measures to fully mitigate in the downwind area the impacts of transported pollutants.Requires States, for each Moderate ozone nonattainment area determined to be such an upwind area, to submit a plan revision containing provisions for an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program required for Serious Areas.Imposes requirements analogous to those above upon upwind States (those that cause or significantly contribute to a violation of the national standard for ozone in an area in one or more other States).Requires maintenance plans for upwind areas and States (in cases of requests for redesignation of nonattainment areas) to be amended to include: (1) the enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance measures described in this Act; and (2) implementation of all measures concerning the pollutant concerned which were contained in the implementation plan as well as those not yet implemented that are necessary to fully mitigate transport of ozone and its precursors to downwind areas. Prohibits relaxation or rescission of control measures or rules in such upwind areas or States."
