Requires such information to include the analysis and comparison of the availability and affordability of insurance coverage and the quality and type of coverage for small businesses, including small businesses located in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and minority- and women-owned small businesses. Directs the Administrator to provide for the waiver of such reporting requirements for each insurer within a State which requires insurers to submit a level of information at least equivalent to that required herein and which provides for adequate enforcement of such requirements.Requires: (1) each insurer to maintain submitted information for at least three years after each reporting period; (2) all submitted information to be made available to the public; (3) the Administrator to designate appropriate lines of insurance and coverage types for small businesses; and (4) the Administrator to survey a representative sample of small business owners regarding their experience in applying for, obtaining, and being refused small business insurance.Provides civil penalties against insurers violating the requirements of this Act."
