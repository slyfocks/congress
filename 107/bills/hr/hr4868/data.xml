Minority National Security Scholarship Act of 2002 - Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a program for awarding: (1) scholarships to minority American undergraduates (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Arab, African American, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic or Latino) to enable them to study, for at least one academic semester, in "critical" countries in which few minority students are studying; (2) fellowships to enable minority American graduate students to pursue education in the United States in the disciplines of foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields, and to enter into an agreement to work for a Federal agency or office in the field studied; and (3) grants to enable institutions of higher education to establish, operate, or improve programs in foreign languages, area studies, and other international fields in which minority students, educators, and Government employees are deficient in learning.Requires a recipient of any fellowship, or scholarship that provides assistance for periods that aggregate 12 months or more, to maintain satisfactory academic progress and to work for the Federal Government or in the field of education in the area of study for which the scholarship or fellowship was awarded for a period specified by the Secretary. Requires any recipient failing to meet those requirements to reimburse the United States for the amount of assistance provided under the program, with interest.</summary>
