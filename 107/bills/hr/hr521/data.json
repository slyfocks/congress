Authorizes the Supreme Court of Guam to create divisions of the Superior Court and other local courts of Guam.Lists the courts of record for Guam.Outlines the jurisdiction and powers of the local courts.Provides that the qualifications and duties of the justices and judges of the courts shall be governed by the laws of Guam and the rules of such courts.Repeals provisions granting the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit jurisdiction to review all final decisions of the Supreme Court of Guam (effectively allowing direct review of such decisions to the Supreme Court of the United States)."
