  <summary>6/5/2001--Introduced.
Requires the National Science Foundation (NSF), for the purpose of integrating scientific disciplines in relation to research on learning and gaining a better understanding of how such research and educational practice can be reconciled, to continue to support such research, focusing on: (1) brain research as a foundation for research on learning; (2) behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social aspects of learning; (3) science, mathematics, engineering, and technological learning in educational settings; and (4) learning in complex educational systems.Requires the Director of the NSF to review past research on learning, assess current research efforts, and develop a set of specific education research priorities to provide the strategic focus of the Centers of Research on Learning established by this Act. Requires the Director to make grants for the establishment of not more than five such Centers to integrate the work of multidisciplinary teams of researchers, education practitioners, and policymakers to support the research priorities developed, and to facilitate the incorporation of research results into educational practice.Requires the Director to establish a program to award grants to institutions of higher education or scientific research institutions (or consortia thereof) to provide fellowships to elementary and secondary teachers: (1) for participation in research programs at such institutions aimed at giving fellowship recipients a better understanding of the behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social aspects of human learning; and (2) to facilitate the transfer of the results of learning research into the elementary and secondary education systems.Authorizes appropriations for NSF participation in the Interagency Education Research Initiative.</summary>
