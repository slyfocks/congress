    "text": "Worker's Freedom of Choice Act - Prohibits labor unions or employers subject to valid labor agreements from receiving, soliciting, or accepting payment of dues or fees not related to exclusive representation and core purposes, including collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment (notwithstanding an exception under the National Labor Relations Act relating to union security agreements which require payment of union dues or fees as a condition of employment). Gives a right of civil action to employees who dispute the amount so collected by labor organizations. Requires employers to post notice of such prohibition against labor unions using dues or fees, which are collected as conditions of employment, for any activities not necessary to performing their duties of exclusive representation of employees in dealing with employers on labor-management issues (union duties).Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to require every labor union to attribute and report expenses by function classification, verified by independent audit, in enough detail to allow its members to determine whether such expenses were necessary to perform such union duties. Requires disclosure under such Act to employees required to pay any union dues or fees under a union security agreement as well as to union members.Prohibits labor union retaliation or coercion against any employee for exercising any right granted or protected by this Act."
