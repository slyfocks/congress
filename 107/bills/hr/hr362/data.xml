  <summary>1/31/2001--Introduced.
Justice through Assured Knowledge and Enforcement Act - Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for pre-release records check programs carried out by States. Requires that such a program: (1) prohibit a law enforcement agency from releasing a person from custody, or transferring a person into the custody of another such agency, unless that agency first carries out a pre-release records check; (2) prohibit that agency from releasing or transferring a person with an unresolved warrant or charge unless that agency first notifies the law enforcement agency initiating that warrant or charge that the person is in custody, provides such agency with a reasonable opportunity to resolve that warrant or charge, and notifies the law enforcement agency to which the person is to be transferred of such warrant or charge; and (3) subject an official responsible for violating such prohibitions to administrative discipline.Prohibits a State that fails to implement such a program from receiving ten percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to the State under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and requires such funds to be reallocated to States that comply.</summary>
