  <summary>7/8/2002--Passed House amended.
Fort Clatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2002 - Authorizes the acquisition of certain additional lands for inclusion within the Fort Clatsop National Memorial in Oregon. Prohibits the total area designated as the Memorial from exceeding 1,500 acres.Allows the Secretary of the Interior to acquire such lands, other than corporately owned timberlands, only by donation or purchase from willing sellers.Directs the Secretary to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the owner of the corporately owned timberlands regarding the manner in which such lands will be managed after acquisition if such owner agrees to enter into a sale of such lands as a result of actual condemnation proceedings or in lieu of such proceedings.Requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the area near McGowan, Washington, where the Lewis and Clark Expedition first camped after reaching the Pacific Ocean, known as the Station Camp site, as well as the Megler Rest Area and Fort Canby State Park, to determine their suitability for inclusion in the National Park System.</summary>
