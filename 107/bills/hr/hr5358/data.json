Permits the Secretary concerned to grant an exception to such limitation for extraordinary circumstances.Allows the Secretary concerned to provide cost-share grants and cooperative agreements to establish Restoration and Value-Added Centers to augment community-based restoration projects on Federal lands. Prescribes that the Centers shall provide technical assistance to small enterprises or micro-enterprises in specified areas.Authorizes the Secretary concerned to enter into partnerships and cooperative agreements with specified groups in creating and maintaining the Centers. Requires the Secretary concerned to provide cost-share grants and/or cooperative agreements equaling 75 percent of each Center's operating costs, not to exceed $1,000,000 annually per Center."
