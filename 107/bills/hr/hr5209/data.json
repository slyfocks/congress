Provides that funds under current NSEP grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) may also be used for grants for NFLI programs in which IHEs train students in a range of disciplines with advanced levels of proficiency in those foreign languages that the Secretary of Defense identifies as being the most critical to U.S. national security interests. Requires IHEs receiving a grant for NFLI to give special consideration to applicants who are Federal employees.Allows NSEP scholarship and fellowship recipients to fulfill their service requirements in any Federal agency or department."
