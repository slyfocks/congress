  <summary>9/9/2002--Introduced.
Chance to Succeed Act of 2002 - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to include as a work activity satisfactory participation in services to address barriers designed to improve future employment opportunities, including substance abuse treatment and physical rehabilitation, mental health, and mental retardation and developmental disabilities services.Requires the assessment for each assistance recipient to determine whether the recipient has any such barriers.Prohibits a TANF-recipient State from imposing a sanction against an individual or family on the basis of noncompliance with a program requirement if the individual whose conduct is the basis of the sanction is in the uncompleted process of being screened or assessed for a mental health problem, disability, substance abuse problem, or sexual or domestic violence situation, or if the services outlined in the service plan developed for the individual or family were not offered, available, and accessible to the individual or family at the time of the noncompliance.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting a State in compliance with its requirements from imposing a sanction for noncompliance with work requirements against an individual or family who opts to not take full advantage of the opportunity for assessment or the services and supports made available.Requires each State receiving a State family assistance grant to establish an advisory panel to review the efficacy of each TANF-funded program.</summary>
