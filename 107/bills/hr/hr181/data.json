Exempts such trust funds from any general statutory budget outlays limitation.Requires the Secretary of the Army to estimate annually: (1) what, but for this Act, would be at the close of the next fiscal year the amount of unfunded inland waterways and harbor maintenance authorizations; and (2) the net inland waterways and harbor maintenance receipts at the close of such year."
