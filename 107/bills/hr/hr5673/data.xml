Early Education Employee Benefit Act of 2002 - Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make competitive matching grants to States and local governments to: (1) enter Early Education Benefit Agreements with private partners to provide part of the cost of Early Education Benefits, which reduce costs incurred by employees and union members to obtain early education (including child care, preschool, and other early childhood programs); or (2) make Early Education Start-Up Grants to assist private partners to pay part of the cost of acquiring, building, and renovating physical premises to be used as new early education facilities, if such partners subsidize attendance at those facilities for children of lower-paid employees or union members.</summary>
