  <summary>3/1/2001--Introduced.
Declares that U.S.-produced taconite pellets shall be considered an article like or directly competitive with semifinished steel slab for purposes of: (1) any International Trade Commission determination whether semifinished steel slab is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury (or threat) to the domestic industry producing taconite pellets (thus requiring presidential action to facilitate a positive industry adjustment to such imports); (2) any investigation leading to the imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties; and (3) the Secretary of Labor's determination of the eligibility of a group of adversely affected workers for trade adjustment assistance.</summary>
