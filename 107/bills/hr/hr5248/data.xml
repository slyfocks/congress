Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to proceed without regard to certain provisions of law, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the National Forest Management Act. Exempts such activities from the notice, comment, and appeal requirements of the Appeals Reform Act and from judicial review by any U.S. court.</summary>
