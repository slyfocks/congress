Makes a patent owner's failure to timely file with the FDA a bar to civil actions for patent infringement.Requires the first generic drug applicant with a specified certification to forfeit the 180 day marketing exclusivity period to a subsequent generic drug applicant if the first generic drug applicant engages in certain behaviors which delay or prevent the marketing of the generic drug."
