Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give priority to adults and adolescents who are medically underserved and at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Specifies that the purposes for which such amounts appropriated are available include (with respect to immunizations for adults and adolescents) payment of the costs of storing vaccines, outreach activities, and other program expenses necessary for the establishment or operation of immunization programs.Directs the Secretary to: (1) coordinate with public and private entities, and develop and disseminate guidelines, to ensure that immunizations are routinely offered to adults and adolescents by public and private health care providers; (2) cooperate with public and private entities to obtain information for required annual evaluations; (3) increase (relative to FY 2001) the extent to which the Secretary collects data on the incidence, prevalence, and circumstances of diseases and adverse events that are experienced by adults and adolescents that may be associated with immunizations; (4) ensure that the entities with which the Secretary cooperates include managed care organizations, community based organizations that provide health services, and other health care providers; and (5) provide for projects to identify racial and ethnic minority groups and other health disparity populations for which immunization rates for adults and adolescents are below such rates for the general population, and to determine the factors underlying such disparities."
