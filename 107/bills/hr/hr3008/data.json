Sets forth criteria governing when groups of workers may petition for a certification of eligibility to apply for such adjustment assistance, including that: (1) a significant number or proportion of workers have become separated or threatened with separation from employment; (2) sales or production have decreased absolutely; and (3) the events of September 11, 2001, contributed importantly to such separation and decline.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 and 2003."
