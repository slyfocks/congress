Prohibits an individual from enrolling or being enrolled in a school for instruction as a pilot of an aircraft unless the individual has a card issued by the Administrator that certifies that such individual is eligible, based on specified requirements, for such instruction. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act."
