  <summary>10/2/2001--Introduced.
Flight School Security Act of 2001 - Amends Federal aviation law to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to: (1) conduct a comprehensive review of the enrollment practices of civilian flight schools and schools providing instruction in the repair of aircraft; and (2) issue regulations to prevent instruction in flying aircraft (or the repair of such aircraft) by such schools to individuals that the Administrator has determined are a threat to security. Prohibits an individual from enrolling or being enrolled in a school for instruction as a pilot of an aircraft unless the individual has a card issued by the Administrator that certifies that such individual is eligible, based on specified requirements, for such instruction. Sets forth civil penalties for violations of the requirements of this Act.</summary>
