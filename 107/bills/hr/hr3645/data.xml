  <summary>7/22/2002--Passed House amended.
Veterans Health Care and Procurement Improvement Act of 2002 - Requires any procurement of a health-care item by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be made through the use of a Federal Supply Schedule (Schedule) contract or national contract that meets specified requirements, including the presence of pre-award and post-award audit clauses and a price reduction clause. Provides exceptions for a procurement that is: (1) necessary to meet a medical emergency at a medical center; (2) for a health-care item not listed in such contracts; (3) for a specialized item; (4) part of an approved sharing agreement between the Department and the Department of Defense; or (5) supporting a contract or subcontract with a small business qualifying for a procurement preference program under the Small Business Act.Requires, in the case of an emergency Department procurement of a health-care item, that the quantity procured not exceed that reasonably necessary to meet the emergency at the medical center concerned.Requires such procurement procedures to: (1) maximize health-care item variety and the use of the Schedule; and (2) be reviewed by the Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special-Disabilities Programs.Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish: (1) annual goals for Department medical centers for the purchase of health-care items using the above contracts; and (2) goals for procurements from small businesses qualifying for a procurement preference program. Directs the Secretary to report annually to the veterans' committees on the procurement of health-care items. Requires the Advisory Committee to comment on each such report.(Sec. 4) Revises the authority of the Secretary to enter into enhanced-use leases of Department real property to: (1) allow any Department Under Secretary (currently, only the Under Secretary for Health) to propose a business plan for such use; (2) allow the consideration provided under such a lease to be used for any Department programs and activities (currently, only for the provision of medical care and services); (3) require the Secretary to notify the veterans' committees and the public before conducting a hearing on a proposed lease; (4) allow such a lease to be entered into 45 (currently 90) days after such notice; (5) require a cost-benefit analysis of each proposed lease; (6) terminate a current report requirement; (7) terminate the requirement that the Secretary request the Administrator of General Services to dispose of leased property (thus giving the Secretary sole disposition authority); (8) reduce from 90 to 45 days the required prior congressional notification before such a disposition; and (9) allow the Secretary to use lease proceeds to reimburse applicable Department appropriations for expenses incurred in the development of additional enhanced-use leases.(Sec. 5) Requires (current law authorizes) the Secretary to furnish hospital and nursing home care and medical services, on the same basis as provided to veterans, to a Commonwealth Army veteran or new Philippine Scout who resides in the United States as a citizen or lawfully admitted alien, provided that the Secretary first certifies that sufficient resources are available at the facilities at which the majority of such veterans or Scouts would receive such care and services.(Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to furnish outpatient dental services and treatment for all former prisoners of war (currently only for those detained at least 90 days).(Sec. 7) Requires additional information within annual reports from each research corporation performing research for the Department, including a description of each project or activity and the amount of funds used during the year. Requires any audit report to specifically state whether the audited corporation made any payment or provided any travel to a member of its board of directors and, if so, the amount and recipient. Requires the Department's Inspector General to review a specified amount of all research corporation audits. Requires annual reports from the Secretary to the veterans' committees on such corporations to be based on annual corporation reports. Extends through 2006 the authority to establish such corporations.(Sec. 8) Allows the Secretary to authorize the Secretary of Defense to make purchases through the Department's revolving supply fund in the same manner as activities of the Department (requiring reimbursement).(Sec. 9) Designates the Department outpatient clinic in New London, Connecticut, as the John J. McGuirk Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic.</summary>
