Directs that, for each fiscal year, at least half of the grant expenditures approved by the Commission support activities or projects that benefit counties for which distressed county designations are in effect.Modifies Act provisions to direct that not more than 75 percent of the costs of any activity eligible for financial assistance for a development district that includes one or more counties for which a distressed county designation is in effect be provided from funds appropriated to carry out the Act.Adds Edmonson, Hart, and Metcalfe ( Kentucky), and Grenada, Montgomery, and Panola (Mississippi) to the counties included in the Appalachian region.Reauthorizes appropriations and extends the Act until October 1, 2006."
