Prohibits the Secretary from making any such determination unless it is supported by data obtained by species observation in the field.Directs the Secretary to make such determinations and revisions by a rule made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.Prohibits the Secretary from adding to or removing a species from such lists unless such action is supported by substantial evidence.Requires the Secretary to prepare and publish with a final rule an analysis of the economic impact of such rule.Prohibits the Secretary from releasing any experimental population on or affecting private property except by a rulemaking.Requires the Secretary to approve or disapprove an application for an incidental take permit within 90 days."
