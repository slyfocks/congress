  <summary>1/31/2001--Introduced.
Social Security Lock-box Act of 2001 - Amends H. Con. Res. 290 (106th Congress) to replace a point of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate against consideration of any revision of such resolution or any concurrent budget resolution for FY 2002 that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year with one that provides a point of order against consideration of: (1) any budget resolution that sets forth a surplus for any fiscal year that is less than the surplus of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund for such year; and (2) legislation that would cause the surplus for any fiscal year covered by the most recently agreed to budget resolution to be less than the surplus of the Fund for such year. Establishes the levels of surplus for purposes of enforcing the preceding points of order.</summary>
