Modifies rules for replacement of involuntarily converted livestock, including to extend the replacement period (for both weather-related sales and sales forced by Federal policy) and to prescribe that an heir to an estate may replace such property within the required time frame.Applies this Act to sales and exchanges made after December 31, 2000."
