  <summary>1/31/2001--Introduced.
Airline Passenger Fair Treatment Act of 2001 - Amends Federal aviation law to revise provisions prohibiting an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent from engaging in unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation. Extends such prohibition to any action of an air carrier or foreign air carrier that: (1) fails to provide a consumer full access to all fares for air transportation provided by them, regardless of the technology or other method the consumer uses to access the fares; (2) fails to provide an air carrier passenger with an accurate explanation of the reasons for a flight delay, cancellation, or diversion from a ticketed itinerary; or (3) prohibits a person (including a governmental entity) that purchases air transportation from only using a portion of the air transportation purchased (including using air transportation purchased only for one-way travel instead of round-trip travel), or assesses an additional fee on or charge to such person or ticket agent that sold the air transportation to such person.Prohibits an air carrier or foreign air carrier, in the case of a termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in the competitive circumstances of a ticket agent's appointment, from failing to provide the ticket agent with: (1) written notice, and a full statement of reasons for the action, on or before the 90th day preceding the action; and (2) at least 60 days to correct any deficiency claimed in such notice. Exempts a carrier from this requirement only in cases of insolvency, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, bankruptcy, or nonpayment of sums due under the appointment.Revises the preemption of State, local, and regional law or regulation related to a price, route, or level of service for air transportation provided by an air carrier. Limits the preemption to any such law or regulation that would directly prescribe a price, route, or level of service.Directs the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations to establish minimum Federal standards for resuscitation, emergency medical, and first-aid equipment and supplies to be carried on board an aircraft operated by an air carrier that is capable of carrying at least 30 passengers.Bars an air carrier or foreign air carrier from preventing or hindering (including by failing to assist) a passenger from exiting an aircraft if: (1) the aircraft is parked at an airport terminal gate with access to ramp or other facilities through which passengers are customarily boarded and deplaned; (2) such aircraft has remained at the gate more than one hour past its scheduled departure time; and (3) the aircraft captain has not been informed by air traffic control authorities that such aircraft can be cleared for departure within 15 minutes.</summary>
