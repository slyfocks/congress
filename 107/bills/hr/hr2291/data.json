Requires that grant priority be given to a coalition serving economically disadvantaged areas.Authorizes the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to make a grant to an eligible organization to provide for establishment of a National Community Antidrug Coalition Institute to: (1) provide education, training, and technical assistance for coalition leaders and community teams; (2) develop and disseminate evaluation tools, mechanisms, and measures to better assess and document coalition performance measures and outcomes; and (3) bridge the gap between research and practice by translating knowledge from research into practical information.Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy to ensure that the same or similar activities are not carried out, through the use of funds for administrative costs or funds provided under this Act, by more than one recipient."
