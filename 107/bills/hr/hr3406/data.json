Mandates that FPMA rates and charges be the lowest possible to recover all costs incurred for the production of electric energy sold by them. Places FPMA transmission systems under FERC jurisdiction.Makes it unlawful for any person to: (1) change the retail electric supplier without the consumer's consent; or (2) charge a retail electric consumer for electric energy or related services (cramming) unless expressly authorized by law or by the consumer's agreement to purchase such energy or services. Authorizes the Federal Trade Commission to promulgate rules governing these matters as well as retail electric consumer privacy.Permits electric energy purchases by retail electric consumers on an aggregate basis.Expresses the sense of Congress in favor of universal and affordable retail electric energy service."
