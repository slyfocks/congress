  <summary>10/16/2002--Passed House amended.
(Sec. 1) Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit any person from operating a motor vehicle at a land border port of entry with a drug or alcohol in his or her body in violation of applicable State law. Deems any individual who operates a motor vehicle at a land border port of entry to have given consent to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test for drugs or alcohol by an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer. Directs the Attorney General to notify an individual's State (or foreign state) of motor vehicle licensing or residence of an individual's: (1) refusal to submit to testing; and (2) conviction for violating this section.(Sec. 2) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize an INS officer who: (1) has reasonable grounds to believe that a driver at a land border port of entry may be operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol to require the driver to submit to a breath test; and (2) arrests a driver for operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol to require the driver to submit to a blood, breath, or urine test.(Sec. 3) Requires the Attorney General to post notice at each land border port of entry that operation of a motor vehicle with a drug or alcohol in the driver's body at such port of entry is a Federal offense.(Sec. 4) Requires the Attorney General to issue regulations authorizing an INS officer to impound a vehicle operated at a land border port of entry if: (1) the driver refuses to submit to a chemical or other test; and (2) the impoundment is not inconsistent with the laws of the State in which the port of entry is located.</summary>
