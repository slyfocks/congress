    "text": "Broadband Competition and Incentives Act of 2001 - Amends the Clayton Act to prohibit a Bell operating company or affiliate (BOC) from providing interLATA services in any of its in-region States under any amendments to provisions concerning BOCs under the Communications Act of 1934 enacted after April 24, 2001, unless the Attorney General determines that such BOC does not have market power in the provision of wireline telephone exchange service in the State involved. Deems a BOC to have such market power if it provides service to more than 85 percent of the business or residential subscribers in such State at the time it requests that the Attorney General make such determination.Prohibits a State or political subdivision from imposing: (1) discriminatory taxes on broadband services; or (2) a tax or fee imposed on telecommunications carriers or affiliates thereof, other than incumbent local exchange carriers and affiliates, for the use of public rights-of-way that is greater than the tax or fee imposed on incumbent local exchange carriers or affiliates for their use of public rights-of-way.Authorizes the Attorney General to make direct loans or loan guarantees to eligible broadband service providers to finance the deployment of broadband services to eligible rural communities and underserved areas. Prohibits the Attorney General from considering the technology proposed to be employed by the applicants. Allows the Attorney General to take a security interest in assets or revenue streams to cover the assets financed."
