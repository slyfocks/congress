  <summary>10/17/2002--Passed Senate amended.
Real Interstate Driver Equity Act of 2001 - Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit a State or political subdivision or an interstate agency of two or more States from enacting or enforcing any law, rule, or regulation requiring a license or fee on account of the fact that a motor vehicle is providing pre-arranged ground transportation service, if the motor carrier providing such service: (1) meets all applicable registration and vehicle and intrastate passenger licensing requirements; and (2) is providing such service, including intermediate stops in another State without taking on new passengers, pursuant to a contract for interstate and intrastate passenger travel.Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed as: (1) subjecting taxicab service to Federal regulation (including certain Federal minimum financial responsibility requirements); (2) prohibiting or restricting an airport, train, or bus terminal operator from contracting to provide preferential access or facilities to one or more providers of pre-arranged ground transportation service; or (3) restricting the right of a State to require, in a nondiscriminatory manner, an individual operating a vehicle providing prearranged ground transportation service originating in the State to have submitted to pre-licensing drug testing or a criminal background investigation in the operator's domicile State, by the State in which the operator is licensed to provide the service, or by the motor carrier providing it, as a condition of providing such service.</summary>
