    "text": "Brevard County Sea Turtle Habitat Restoration and Federal Mitigation Act of 2002 - Modifies the Brevard County, Florida, shoreline protection project to authorize the Secretary of the Army to incorporate in such project any or all of the 7.1-mile reach of the project that was deleted from the project's south reach if the Secretary determines that such modification is technically sound, environmentally acceptable, and economically justified. Requires the Secretary, after the completion of a certain damage study, to provide the non-Federal interest credit toward non-Federal nourishment costs and renourishment costs associated with the shore protection project for any damages to Brevard County beaches that are the result of a Federal navigation project, as determined in the final report for the study by the independent coastal expert. Requires the amount of the credit to be determined based on the reported damages, and to be applied (without interest) against future non-Federal nourishment and renourishment costs until the entire mitigation credit is depleted. Calls for certain actions to ensure that the Federal navigation project does not cause further downstream erosion."
