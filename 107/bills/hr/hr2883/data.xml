Patriot Act of 2001.(Sec. 314) Amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to extend from 24 to 72 hours the time for judicial ratification of an emergency surveillance or search conducted under such Act.Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency - Amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to: (1) revise an audit date concerning the CIA's central services program; and (2) repeal the March 31, 2002, termination date for such program.(Sec. 402) Extends through FY 2003 the authority of the DCI to offer separation pay to CIA employees who voluntarily separate from service.(Sec. 403) Requires the DCI to: (1) rescind CIA guidelines for handling cases involving foreign assets or sources with human rights concerns; (2) provide for guidelines that more appropriately weigh and provide incentives for risks to achieve successful operations; and (3) ensure that information is shared so that actions to protect American lives can be taken.(Sec. 404) Amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 to authorize the DCI to reimburse certain counterterrorism employees for 100 percent (currently one-half) of the cost of professional liability insurance.Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities - Authorizes the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to use funds available for a DOD intelligence element to purchase promotional items of nominal value to recruit individuals for employment within that element.(Sec. 502) Authorizes the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to transfer or reprogram funds for infrastructure and quality-of-life improvements at the Menwith Hall and Bad Aibling stations.(Sec. 503) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 to: (1) revise certification requirements relating to official immunity for employees and agents of the United States and foreign countries engaged in the interdiction of illegal aircraft drug trafficking; and (2) require an annual report from the President to Congress regarding countries for which such certifications were in effect.(Sec. 504) Authorizes the Secretary to establish an undergraduate training program for civilian NIMA employees, similar to that provided to civilian NSA employees, under which such employees are provided financial assistance to develop mission-critical skills.(Sec. 505) Requires the: (1) DCI to ensure that any report, review, study, or plan required by this Act that involves intelligence or intelligence-related activities of DOD be prepared or conducted in consultation with the Secretary of Defense or other appropriate DOD official; and (2) defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees to receive all such reports, reviews, studies, or plans.(Sec. 506) Permits the NSA Director to authorize agency personnel to perform protective services and law enforcement functions up to 500 feet beyond the confines of NSA facilities, including upon streets, sidewalks, and open areas, when acting reasonably to protect against physical damage or injury.
