Directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to establish an interagency council to coordinate implementation of the National Fire Plan. Requires the council to: (1) define consistent criteria to identify the communities within the wildland/urban interface that are most at risk from severe wildfires; (2) establish goals and objectives for implementing agencies; (3) establish measures to assess progress in reducing the risks to such communities; (4) develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for Plan implementation; and (5) provide for collection of data to assist the Secretaries in determining the most effective and appropriate methods of utilizing fuel materials removed from covered public lands.Requires the Secretaries to assure that: (1) in conducting fuel reduction efforts, priority is given to such communities; and (2) no other projects to reduce fuels are carried out in a State until all necessary fuel-reduction efforts with respect to such communities in that State are completed.</summary>
