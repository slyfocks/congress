Makes remedies provided under the laws of the host country the exclusive remedies for acts or omissions committed while providing services under the agreement.Declares that neither the firefighter, the sending country, nor any organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject to any action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of providing wildfire presuppression or suppression services under such a reciprocal agreement."
