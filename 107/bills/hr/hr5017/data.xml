Amends the Temporary Emergency Wildfire Suppression Act, as amended by the Wildfire Suppression Assistance Act, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, as part of any reciprocal agreement with a foreign country for sharing personnel to fight wildfires, to include a provision that personnel furnished under the agreement to provide wildfire presuppression or suppression services will be considered, for tort liability purposes, employees of the country receiving such services when the personnel provide them under the agreement.Prohibits the Secretaries from entering into any such agreement unless the foreign country (either directly or through the fire organization that is a party to the agreement) agrees to assume any and all liability for the acts or omissions of American firefighters engaged in providing such services under the agreement in the foreign country. Makes remedies provided under the laws of the host country the exclusive remedies for acts or omissions committed while providing services under the agreement.Declares that neither the firefighter, the sending country, nor any organization associated with the firefighter shall be subject to any action whatsoever pertaining to or arising out of providing wildfire presuppression or suppression services under such a reciprocal agreement.</summary>
