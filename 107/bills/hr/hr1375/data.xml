  <summary>4/3/2001--Introduced.
Medicare Geographic Adjustment Fairness Act of 2001 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, as amended by the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, with respect to decisions of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board to reclassify a disproportionate share hospital (DSH) for purposes of the adjustment factor used to adjust the diagnostic related statistical group (DRG) prospective payment rate for area differences in hospital wage levels. Makes any such Board decision to reclassify a DSH for purposes of the adjustment factor for FY 2001 or any subsequent fiscal year apply for purposes of adjusting payments made on a prospective basis for variations in costs attributable to wages and wage-related costs for prospective payment system-reimbursed items and services.</summary>
