  <summary>9/14/2001--Introduced.
Federal Airports Security Enhancement Act - Amends Federal aviation law to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to establish at each airport a Security Committee which shall make recommendations for minimum security counter-measures. Requires the Administrator, on the basis of such recommendations, to prescribe appropriate changes to improve the performance of existing airport security procedures.Requires the screening of passengers and property that will be carried in a cabin of an aircraft to be carried out by Federal Protective Service employees or agents. (Currently, screening is carried out by employees or agents of an air carrier, interstate air carrier, or foreign air carrier).Authorizes the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to appoint police officers and special agents (currently, special policemen and nonuniformed special policemen) for the policing of all Federal buildings (including buildings under the control of the GSA). Sets forth certain additional powers of such officers and agents, including the authority to carry firearms and to police areas adjacent to Federal property.Establishes the Federal Protective Service as a separate operating service of the GSA. Calls for at least 1,000 full-time equivalent Service police officers to be assigned to areas outside of airport operations. Requires the Commissioner of the Service to prescribe minimum employment and training standards to be applied in the contracting of security personnel for the policing of buildings and areas controlled by the United States and GSA. Authorizes GSA to recover airport security costs from the FAA.</summary>
