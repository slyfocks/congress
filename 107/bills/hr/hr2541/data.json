Adds a new protective function with respect to a President-elect.Creates a new (misdemeanor) prohibition against obstructing, resisting, or interfering with a Federal law enforcement agency engaged in the performance of the protective functions authorized by such Act.Specifies that whoever engages in any conduct directed against an individual entitled to protection, which would constitute a violation of the Federal criminal code if such individual were a foreign official, an official guest, or an internationally protected person, shall be subject to the same penalties as are provided for such conduct directed against an individual subject to protection under the Federal criminal code."
