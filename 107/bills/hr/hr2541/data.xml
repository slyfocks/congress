  <summary>11/13/2001--Passed House amended.
Enhanced Protective Activities Act of 2001 - Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize special agents of the Department of State and the Foreign Service to: (1) obtain and execute search warrants, subpoenas, or summonses as those authorities relate to visa fraud investigations (current law) or their protective duties; and (2) make arrests without warrants for certain offenses while conducting their statutory investigative (current law) or protective functions. Adds a new protective function with respect to a President-elect.Creates a new (misdemeanor) prohibition against obstructing, resisting, or interfering with a Federal law enforcement agency engaged in the performance of the protective functions authorized by such Act.Specifies that whoever engages in any conduct directed against an individual entitled to protection, which would constitute a violation of the Federal criminal code if such individual were a foreign official, an official guest, or an internationally protected person, shall be subject to the same penalties as are provided for such conduct directed against an individual subject to protection under the Federal criminal code.</summary>
