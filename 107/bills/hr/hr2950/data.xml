Excludes the interest on such bonds from an individual's gross income.Makes corridor development activities (including the acquisition of locomotives, rolling stock, track, and signal equipment) eligible for Federal assistance.Amends specified Federal law to change from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary's authority to provide direct loans and loan guarantees for rail rehabilitation and improvement projects to State and local governments, interstate compacts, government sponsored authorities and corporations, railroads, and joint ventures that include at least one railroad.</summary>
