Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 and 2004 for development of such system.(Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary, in each of the five calendar years following the enactment of this Act, to report to specified congressional committees on the progress made in implementing the 21st Century Strategic Plan issued on June 3, 2002, and on any amendments made to it.(Sec. 5) Amends Federal patent law to provide that previous citation by or to, or consideration by the Office of, a patent or printed publication does not preclude the existence of a substantial new question of patentability in patent reexamination proceedings.(Sec. 6) Revises requirements for appeals in inter partes reexamination proceedings to allow a third-party requester to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or be a party to any appeal taken by the patent owner, with respect to any final decision favorable to the patentability of any original or proposed amended or new claim of the patent.Allows a third-party requester to appeal a decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.Provides that a third-party requester in an inter partes reexamination proceeding dissatisfied with the final decision in an appeal to the Board may appeal the decision only to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."
