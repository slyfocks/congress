Includes within such small business procurement requirements the award of: (1) 23 percent of such contracts to New York City small businesses; (2) five percent to New York City small businesses owned and controlled by women; and (3) five percent to New York City small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Requires funds recapture if such minimum requirements are not met.Requires the Administrator to use New York recovery funds to provide grants, loans, and other assistance to small businesses in New York City and allows any other Federal agency to provide additional New York recovery funds to an entity that follows the minimum small business procurement requirements specified above (substituting 25 for 23 percent in the first requirement)."
