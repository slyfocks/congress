  <summary>9/26/2002--Introduced.
Geologic Research Enhancement Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, working through the United States Geological Survey, to establish and carry out the High Plains Aquifer Comprehensive Hydrogeologic Characterization, Mapping, Modeling and Monitoring Program.Requires the Program to: (1) undertake mapping of the hydrogeological configuration of the Aquifer; (2) perform analyses of the current and past rates at which groundwater is being withdrawn and recharged, the net rate of decrease or increase in Aquifer storage, the factors controlling the rate of migration of water, and the current and past rate of loss of saturated thickness within the Aquifer; and (3) develop necessary regional databases and groundwater flow models.Requires the Program to include a Federal component and a State component and lists priorities of each, including (respectively): (1) coordinating Federal, State, and local data, maps and models into an integrated physical characterization of the Aquifer; and (2) hydrogeologic characterization, mapping, modeling, and monitoring activities in areas of the Aquifer that will assist in addressing issues relating to groundwater depletion and resource assessment of the Aquifer.Provides for the establishment of a Federal Review Panel to evaluate the funding proposals submitted by entities of the High Plains Aquifer States.Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, to prepare a plan for the Program to address overall priorities for the Program and a management structure and Program operations.</summary>
