    "text": "Children's Act for Responsible Employment of 2001 - CARE Act of 2001 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to repeal certain exemptions from child labor prohibitions for agricultural employment.Applies the same age restrictions to agricultural employment as to other forms of employment. Limits exemptions to agricultural labor outside of school hours, if the individual is employed by a specified family member on the member's farm. Raises from 16 to 18 years old the minimum age for engaging in hazardous agricultural employment.Increases civil and criminal penalties for child labor violations.Directs the Secretary of Labor and the Director of the Bureau of the Census to compile data biannually from State employment security agencies and from other sources in all the States concerning: (1) the types of industries and occupations in which children under the age of 18 are employed; and (2) cases in which children were employed in violation of Federal child labor prohibitions. Requires each employer to report to the State employment security agency on any injury to an employee under age 18 that results in lost employment time or any illness such individual incurred while at work.Directs the Secretary to establish closer working relationships with non-governmental organizations and with State and local government agencies having responsibility for administering and enforcing labor and safety and health laws. Requires State and local government agencies to inform the Secretary, upon request, about employee injuries and deaths.Directs the Secretary to: (1) employ at least 100 additional inspectors within the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor to enforce child labor laws; and (2) provide for a ten percent increase in the budget for the Employment Standards Division within the office of the Solicitor of Labor to increase prosecution of violations of such laws.Amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to revise, and review every five years, a farmworker protection standard to take into account the routine presence of children, including nursing children, and nursing or pregnant women employed on, or present near, a farm or in or around a field in which a pesticide is applied.Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to direct the Secretary to make competitive grants for specified types of programs for migrant and seasonal farmworker youth dropout prevention."
