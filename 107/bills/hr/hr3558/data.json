Requires such projects to be conducted in partnership with a Federal agency and on adjacent lands, both Federal and non-Federal, in such a way as to prevent the future reintroduction or dispersal of harmful nonnative species. Requires the Secretary to consider the extent to which a project: (1) addresses the operational backlog of the National Wildlife Refuge System; (2) encourages intergovernmental and public- private cooperation; (3) aids the conservation of endangered species; and (4) includes pilot testing or a demonstration of an innovative technology.Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to States for assessment projects which address priorities for the restoration, management, or enhancement of native fish or wildlife and their natural habitats and processes through the control of harmful nonnative species.Requires the Secretary to consult with the National Invasive Species Council and its advisory board.States that grants shall be for up to two years for a control project, with a possibility of renewal, and for up to five years for a monitoring and maintenance plan. Requires grants to be balanced both geographically and according to the size of the projects.Limits the Federal share of costs of control projects on non-Federal lands to 75 percent (100 percent for Federal lands). Increases such share to 85 percent to cover innovative technology costs.Requires the Council to develop: (1) requirements for the monitoring and maintenance of a control project; and (2) a control project database which includes project techniques and monitoring data.Requires control project grantees to report annually to the Secretary on: (1) the number of acres of native fish and wildlife habitat restored, protected, or enhanced, including a description of the partnerships; (2) an estimate of the long-term success of varying conservation techniques used; (3) the environmental soundness of the projects; and (4) specific methods and techniques used.Directs the Secretary to report biennially to the appropriate congressional committees.Requires the participation of a non-Federal interest who will monitor and maintain the control project before a grant may be made for a control project on Federal lands.(Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary, at the request of a Governor, to financially assist a rapid response to outbreaks of harmful nonnative species when rapid eradication or control is: (1) necessary to protect native fish, wildlife, or their habitats; (2) technically feasible; and (3) minimally disruptive to the ecosystem. Requires the same monitoring and reporting as is required of control project grantees.(Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2003 through 2008, limiting administrative costs."
