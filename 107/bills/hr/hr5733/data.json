Applies this Act to projects and activities under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989.Specifies examples of methods of complying with this Act, including use of print or broadcast media at the local, national, and regional levels. Requires the relevant contractors or aid recipients to provide plans to the United States describing how they will comply with the identification requirement under this Act. Permits a waiver of the identification requirement if complying would have an adverse impact on the objectives of a project or activity."
