  <summary>6/12/2001--Introduced.
Broadband Antitrust Restoration and Reform Act - Amends the Clayton Act to prohibit a Bell operating company (BOC) or an affiliate thereof from providing interLATA service in any of its in-region States under the authority of any amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 enacted after June 13, 2001: (1) unless it files with the Attorney General an application to provide such service; and (2) until the Attorney General either approves or fails to act on such application within 90 days.Authorizes the Attorney General to issue rules to establish requirements applicable to the form and contents of applications, and to make recommendations regarding withdrawal of applications or the filing of an application subsequent to withdrawal.Prohibits the Attorney General from approving an application upon determining that the applicant: (1) has monopoly power in the local exchange market; and (2) is using or is likely to use its monopoly power in order to engage in exclusionary or other anti-competitive conduct. Authorizes the Attorney General, upon making such determination, to reinstate with respect to such applicant any Federal regulation in effect as of June 13, 2001, which the Attorney General determines was designed to protect against exclusionary conduct or other abusive monopoly power.</summary>
