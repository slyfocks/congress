Waives any U.S. immunity otherwise applicable with respect to any such requirement.Authorizes the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue an abatement order to a Federal entity and requires initiation of an administrative enforcement action in the same manner and under the same circumstances as action would be initiated against any other person.Removes provisions for application (and preemption) of State laws concerning removal and remedial action at Federal facilities not on the National Priorities List.Precludes interagency remedial action agreements from impairing or diminishing State authority to enforce requirements of State law, unless such requirements have been addressed or waived without objection from the State."
