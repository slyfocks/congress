Waives such liability limitation where the defendant intended that the service be used in the commission of the offense. States that a provider does not have such intent unless: (1) an employee or agent has such intent; and (2) the conduct constituting the offense was authorized, requested, commanded, performed, or tolerated by one or more members of the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting for the benefit of the provider within the scope of his or her office or employment."
