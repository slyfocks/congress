  <summary>2/12/2002--Introduced.
On-line Criminal Liability Standardization Act of 2002 - Amends the Federal criminal code to provide that no interactive computer service provider shall be liable for an offense against the United States arising from transmitting, storing, distributing, or otherwise making available material provided by another person. Waives such liability limitation where the defendant intended that the service be used in the commission of the offense. States that a provider does not have such intent unless: (1) an employee or agent has such intent; and (2) the conduct constituting the offense was authorized, requested, commanded, performed, or tolerated by one or more members of the board of directors or by a high managerial agent acting for the benefit of the provider within the scope of his or her office or employment.</summary>
