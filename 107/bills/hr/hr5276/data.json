Requires the Secretary to enter into a demonstration project to provide States with funds to use such information to do ex parte determinations or other methods for identifying and enrolling potentially eligible individuals.Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to send a notice and application for Medicaid benefits to individuals identified as likely to be eligible for QMB or SLMB benefits when notifying them that they are eligible for benefits under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) or B (Supplementary Medical Insurance)."
