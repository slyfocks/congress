  <summary>2/26/2002--Introduced.
Common Sense Critical Habitat Act of 2002 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from designating an area as critical habitat of a species: (1) unless the Secretary finds, based on clear and convincing scientific data, that the area is, or historically has been, occupied by a viable population of the species; or (2) if the Secretary determines that the benefits of not designating the area outweigh the benefits of designating the area. Waives such prohibition with respect to an area if the Secretary finds that failure to designate such area will result in the extinction of the species.</summary>
