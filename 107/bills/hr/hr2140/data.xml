  <summary>6/12/2001--Introduced.
Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to provide a customs user fee of $5.50 for the processing of merchandise that is informally entered or released at a centralized hub facility or an express consignment carrier facility (other than shipments valued at $200 or less, which shall not be subject to any fee). Defines "centralized hub facility" and "express consignment carrier facility" to mean a separate or shared specialized facility approved by a port director of the Customs Service for examination and release of imported merchandise carried by an express consignment carrier. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to reimburse from the fees collected for the services provided under this Act each appropriation for amounts paid out from it for the costs incurred by the Secretary in providing such services at centralized hub facilities and express consignment carrier facilities.</summary>
