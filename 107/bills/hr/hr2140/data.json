Defines \"centralized hub facility\" and \"express consignment carrier facility\" to mean a separate or shared specialized facility approved by a port director of the Customs Service for examination and release of imported merchandise carried by an express consignment carrier. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to reimburse from the fees collected for the services provided under this Act each appropriation for amounts paid out from it for the costs incurred by the Secretary in providing such services at centralized hub facilities and express consignment carrier facilities."
