Includes spices, flavorings, colorings, or incidental additives that are or intentionally contain a major food allergen. Requires food that is not a raw agricultural commodity, and that is, or intentionally bears or contains, a major food allergen, to state that information on its label by January 1, 2006.Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give priority to increasing the number of inspections under the Act to ensure that foods comply with practices to reduce or eliminate cross-contact with major food allergen residues and to ensure that major food allergens are properly labeled on foods. Sets forth reporting requirements.Requires the Secretary to contract with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the science relating to glutens in food and celiac disease, and to issue a report to the Secretary and Congress on its findings. Directs the Secretary to issue a proposed rule followed by a final rule to define, and permit use of, the term \"gluten-free\" on the labeling of foods.Directs the Secretary, in the Conference for Food Protection, as part of its cooperative activities between the States under the Public Health Service Act, to pursue certain revisions of the Food Code to provide guidelines for preparing allergen-free foods in food establishments.Requires the Secretary to include assistance relating to the use of different modes of treatment for and prevention of allergic responses to foods when he or she provides technical assistance relating to trauma care and emergency medical services under the Public Health Service Act."
