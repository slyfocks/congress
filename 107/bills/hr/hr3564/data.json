Directs the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Judicial Conference of the United States, to issue an executive order prescribing regulations, rules and procedures for such trials that should, to the maximum extent practicable, be consistent with those pertaining to trials under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.States that such trials may only be convened in accordance with the Act. Directs the President in such a case to submit to Congress certification that trying it in a district court would jeopardize intelligence sources and methods. Preserves the writ of habeas corpus, unless protections under those provisions compromise classified information or intelligence sources and methods."
