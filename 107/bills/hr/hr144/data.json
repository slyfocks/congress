    "text": "Pipeline Safety Act of 2001 - Amends Federal pipeline safety law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation, if he accepts a State's pipeline safety program certification, to make an agreement with the State authority to develop a plan in which it has a role in the oversight of interstate (gas and hazardous liquid) pipelines (currently, a State has authority over intrastate pipelines and pipeline facilities provided the above certification is made) by participating: (1) in special investigations involving interstate pipeline incidents within its borders; (2) in oversight of new construction of interstate pipelines there; and (3) as an interstate agent by carrying out inspection responsibilities for interstate pipelines within its borders to ensure compliance with Federal pipeline safety standards.Requires each operator of a gas transmission or hazardous liquid pipeline facility to: (1) analyze the risks to each facility located in a high-density population area or environmentally sensitive area; and (2) adopt a written integrity management program to reduce risks at such facilities.Authorizes the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, to determine that a pipeline facility is or would be hazardous if its operation or associated equipment, material, or techniques are hazardous to life, property, or the environment.Increases civil penalties for violations of specified Federal pipeline safety standards. Establishes: (1) civil penalties for the illegal discharge of oil or other hazardous liquid; and (2) both civil and criminal penalties for engaging in an excavation activity and subsequently damaging a pipeline facility without reporting it promptly.Requires operators of a gas transmission or hazardous liquid pipeline facility to educate the public on the use of a one-call notification system before excavation and other damage prevention activities, the possible hazards associated with unintended facility releases, the physical indications that a pipeline release may have occurred, the steps that should be taken for public safety, and how to report such a release.Sets forth requirements with respect to: (1) support for innovative technology development as it relates to pipeline safety; (2) qualification of pipeline personnel; and (3) a strategic plan to reduce the annual number of pipeline releases caused by outside force damage by 25 percent within four years of enactment of this Act."
