Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001 - Amends the Small Business Act to: (1) increase and extend through FY 2009 the authorization of appropriations for the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program; (2) increase to $750,000 the maximum award for small businesses participating in the second phase of an STTR Program; (3) require each Federal agency that is required to establish an STTR Program to implement an outreach program to research institutions and small businesses; (4) require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to modify a certain SBA policy directive with respect to Federal funding awards; (5) require each of the above agencies to collect and maintain information necessary to assess its STTR Program; (6) require STTR information to be included in agency databases currently maintaining Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program information; and (7) require STTR information to be included in such agencies' congressional reporting requirements.(Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to include within an annual report on SBIR and STTR programs the number of proposals received from, and total amounts awarded to, HUBZone small businesses under each program.(Sec. 7) Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations to establish a single model agreement for use in the STTR program that allocates between small businesses and research institutions intellectual property rights and any rights to carry out follow-on research, development, or commercialization. Requires each Federal agency that adopts an STTR program to adopt such model agreement.(Sec. 8) Revises provisions concerning the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program (a program to strengthen the technological competitiveness of small businesses) to require the Administrator and the SBIR Program managers to consider whether an SBIR Program proposal addresses the needs of small businesses owned and controlled by women and minorities located in areas not participating in SBIR and STTR programs. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the consideration of such proposals.</summary>
