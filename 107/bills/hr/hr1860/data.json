Requires each Federal agency that adopts an STTR program to adopt such model agreement.(Sec. 8) Revises provisions concerning the Federal and State Technology Partnership Program (a program to strengthen the technological competitiveness of small businesses) to require the Administrator and the SBIR Program managers to consider whether an SBIR Program proposal addresses the needs of small businesses owned and controlled by women and minorities located in areas not participating in SBIR and STTR programs. Requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations establishing standards for the consideration of such proposals."
