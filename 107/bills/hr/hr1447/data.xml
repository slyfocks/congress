  <summary>4/4/2001--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to specify that foreign nationals subject to the ban on electoral campaign contributions by foreign nationals include those who are not nationals of the United States as well as those who are not U.S. citizens. (Thus exempts from the ban persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States even though they are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents under the Immigration and Nationality Act.)</summary>
