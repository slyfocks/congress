  <summary>7/16/2002--Introduced.
Nicaragua Property Dispute Settlement Act of 2002 - Amends the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 to require certain claims of expropriation of property by the Government of Nicaragua be filed by a U.S. citizen within 180 days after enactment of this Act in order to be taken into account for the prohibition on foreign assistance to Nicaragua as long as Nicaragua has not satisfied all expropriation claims against it. (Thus limits to those filed within such time period the number of claims which the Government of Nicaragua must satisfy for the prohibition on U.S. assistance to be lifted.)</summary>
