Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to review, and report to specified congressional committees on, NSF education programs to ensure compliance.(Sec. 4) Requires the NSF Director to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education to: (1) train master teachers who work to improve the teaching of mathematics and science from kindergarten through ninth grade in various ways, including mentoring other teachers; and (2) assist elementary and secondary schools to design and implement master teacher programs. Allows grant funds to be used for: (1) master teacher training and participation in summer research programs; (2) teacher professional development during the school year and summer; (3) guidance for sponsoring schools; and (4) educational materials, equipment, computers, and networks for such master teachers. Requires teachers who apply to participate in such master teacher programs at institutions of higher education to submit to the Director assurances from their schools that they will be provided with sufficient non-classroom time to serve as master teachers.(Sec. 5) Requires the NSF Director and the Secretary of Education jointly to compile and disseminate information on: (1) typical standard prerequisites for middle school and high school students who seek to enter a course of study at an institution of higher education in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology education to teach in an elementary or secondary school; and (2) State licensing requirements for such teachers.(Sec. 6) Requires the NSF Director to make an agreement for the National Academy of Sciences to review and evaluate existing studies on the effectiveness of technology in the classroom on learning and student performance.(Sec. 7) Requires the NSF Director to convene an annual conference on science, mathematics, engineering, and technology business education.(Sec. 8) Requires the NSF Director to award competitive grants to institutions of higher education to provide distance learning opportunities for elementary or secondary school students to participate in research activities in mathematics or science at such institutions through the Internet.(Sec. 9) Requires the NSF Director, in carrying out activities authorized by this Act, to coordinate with the Secretary of Education to ensure close cooperation with programs authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965."
