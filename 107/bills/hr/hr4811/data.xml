  <summary>5/22/2002--Introduced.
Recreational Marine Employment Act of 2002 - Amends the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act with respect to employer liability for death and disability compensation payable to longshore, harbor workers, and other specified marine employees not otherwise covered by State workers compensation laws. Excludes from the definition of employee any individuals employed by or at, or engaged in the construction or maintenance of, a recreational marine facility or structure. Expands the range of individuals whose work is concerned with recreational vessels who do not qualify as employees, including people who principally buy and sell such vessels.Makes such exclusions contingent on the employer's being in compliance with a State workers' compensation law. (Presently they are contingent on workers' being covered under such a law).Modifies requirements for third part actions against vessels for negligence to apply them only to injuries to maritime workers who do not qualify as seamen under specified Federal law. (Presently they apply to injuries to all persons covered under the Act).</summary>
