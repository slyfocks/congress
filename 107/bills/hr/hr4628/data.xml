Requires notification of the congressional intelligence committees.(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account for FY 2003, for full-time personnel for elements within such Account, and for certain classified personnel. Earmarks a specified amount of such funds for the National Drug Intelligence Center.(Sec. 105) Increases amounts authorized to be appropriated under the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities by the amount by which appropriations pursuant to such authorization were increased by: (1) the Emergency Supplemental Act, 2002; and (2) the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States for such amounts as are designated as an emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act).(Sec. 106) Authorizes for appropriation amounts requested in a letter from the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives related to the Defense Emergency Response Fund and designated for incremental costs of intelligence and intelligence-related activities for the war on terrorism, with limitations.(Sec. 107) Authorizes funds appropriated for an intelligence or intelligence-related activity for FY 2003 in excess of the amount specified for such activity in the classified Schedule of Authorizations prepared to accompany this Act, for purposes of reprogramming under the National Security Act of 1947.(Sec. 108) Incorporates into this Act each requirement to submit a report to the congressional intelligence committees included in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report for this bill.(Sec. 109) Requires the DCI to ensure that any report, review, study, or plan required under this Act that involves the intelligence or intelligence-related activities of the Departments of Defense or Energy is prepared or conducted in consultation with the Secretary of Defense or Energy, as appropriate.
