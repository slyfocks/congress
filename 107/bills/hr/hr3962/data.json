Defines \"qualified land\" to mean land located in a county in which 50 percent or more of the total acreage is owned by the Government and is under the administrative jurisdiction of one or more covered Federal agencies.Requires the head of a Federal agency before acquiring such qualified land, to: (1) notify the State's Governor, the county chief executive, and each Member of the House of Representatives and the Senate elected to represent the area in which the land is located; and (2) hold at least one hearing in the county.Prohibits an acquisition of qualified land by a Federal agency which will result in 66 percent or more of the total acreage in a county being owned by the Government and under the jurisdiction of one or more covered agencies, unless it is approved by the county."
