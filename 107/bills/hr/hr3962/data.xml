Good Neighbor Act of 2002 - Prohibits any Federal agency from acquiring any qualified land for a covered agency (the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) unless the Government disposes of qualified land of such agency located in the same county and having a fair market value equal to at least 97 percent of the land to be acquired. Defines "qualified land" to mean land located in a county in which 50 percent or more of the total acreage is owned by the Government and is under the administrative jurisdiction of one or more covered Federal agencies.Requires the head of a Federal agency before acquiring such qualified land, to: (1) notify the State's Governor, the county chief executive, and each Member of the House of Representatives and the Senate elected to represent the area in which the land is located; and (2) hold at least one hearing in the county.Prohibits an acquisition of qualified land by a Federal agency which will result in 66 percent or more of the total acreage in a county being owned by the Government and under the jurisdiction of one or more covered agencies, unless it is approved by the county.</summary>
