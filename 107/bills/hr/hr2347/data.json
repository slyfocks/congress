Disregards income averaging for farmers and commercial fishermen in computing the regular alternative minimum tax.Declares, with respect to the treatment of S corporations and to the tax exemption for farmers' cooperatives, that cooperative marketing includes the value-added processing of the products of cooperative members and other producers through animals that is by: (1) feeding such products to cattle, hogs, fish, chickens, or other animals; and then (2) selling the resulting animals or animal products.Authorizes a U.S. district court to issue a declaratory judgment relating to the initial or continuing qualification of a farmers' cooperative as tax-exempt.Provides, with respect to the small ethanol producer credit, for: (1) authorizing credit allocation among a cooperative's patrons; (2) increasing the gallon capacity for eligible producers; (3) making the credit a non-passive income credit; and (4) removing the credit from the alcohol fuel credit gross income inclusion."
