  <summary>12/13/2001--Conference report filed in House.
No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise, reauthorize, and consolidate various programs. Extends authorizations of appropriations for ESEA programs through FY 2007.Title I: Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged - Revises ESEA title I as Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged (currently Helping Disadvantaged Children Meet High Standards) and its part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) (I-A).(Sec. 101) Establishes I-A requirements for: (1) yearly testing and assessments of student performance; (2) State standards for and assessments of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP); (3) local educational agency (LEA) identification of schools for improvement and corrective actions; (4) reporting to parents and the public on school performance and teacher quality; (5) eligibility requirements for schoolwide programs; and (6) increased qualifications of teachers and paraprofessionals. Provides alternatives for students at public schools failing to meet AYP standards within certain periods, including: (1) public school transfer options for all students at such schools; and (2) supplementary educational services for low-income children who remain at such schools, with such services allowed to be provided by various entities (which may be public or private, nonprofit or for-profit, and may include religious institution-based ones, provided all content and instruction under such services are secular, neutral, and nonideological).Reauthorizes and revises other requirements under the I-A-1 basic program for: (1) State and LEA plans; (2) eligible school attendance areas; (3) schoolwide programs; (4) targeted assistance schools; (5) State reservation of funds for school support, improvement, and recognition; (6) parental involvement; (7) participation of children enrolled in private schools, and (8) certain fiscal and coordination requirements.Revises allocations (I-A-2) to States, outlying areas, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as under LEA Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants programs. Sets forth accountability requirements for State educational agencies (SEAs), local educational agencies (LEAs), and schools to ensure that their students meet such standards.Requires each State to define AYP in a specified manner, which includes separate measurable annual objectives for continuous and substantial improvement for the achievement of all public elementary school and secondary school students in the State, and for the achievement of specific groups: (1) economically disadvantaged students; (2) students from major racial and ethnic groups; (3) students with disabilities; and (4) students with limited English proficiency.Requires States, by the 2005-2006 school year, to conduct annual academic standards-based assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts in grades 3 through 8. Requires such assessments in science at three grade levels by the 2007-2008 school year. Provides for grants to States to develop such assessments.Requires distribution to parents and communities of State and LEA report cards on the academic quality of all schools, including the qualifications of teachers and teachers' aides. Includes among required information in State report cards: (1) comparisons between the actual achievement levels of the specified groups of students and the State's annual measurable objectives for such groups; and (2) professional qualifications of teachers in the State, the percentage of such teachers teaching with emergency or provisional credentials, and the percentage of classes in the State not taught by highly qualified teachers, in the aggregate and disaggregated by high-poverty compared to low-poverty schools.Establishes requirements for academic assessment and for LEA and school improvement. Requires LEAs receiving I-A funds to identify for school improvement any elementary school or secondary school served under I-A that fails, for two consecutive years, to make AYP as defined in the State's plan. Makes such requirement inapplicable to a school if almost every student in each of specified groups enrolled in such school is meeting or exceeding the State's proficient level of academic achievement. Allows LEAs, for schools that are conducting targeted assistance programs, to opt to review the progress of only the students in the school who are served, or are eligible for services, under I-A.Requires an LEA to provide all students enrolled in a school identified for improvement with the option to transfer to another public (including charter) school served by the LEA and not identified for improvement, unless such an option is prohibited by State law. (Requires, to the extent practicable, cooperative agreements with other LEAs in the area for such transfers if all the LEA's public schools are identified for school improvement, corrective action or restructuring.) Requires priority in providing such option to be given to the lowest achieving children from low-income families. Requires LEAs to pay for transportation for students who exercise such option. Requires LEAs to permit children who remain at the school to which they transferred until they have completed the highest grade in that school; but terminates an LEA's obligation to provide for transportation at the end of a school year, if the LEA determines that the former school is no longer identified for improvement or subject to corrective action or restructuring. Requires LEAs to use certain amounts for paying for such transportation (and for providing supplemental educational services for eligible low-income children at schools that fail to make AYP one year after being identified for improvement).Requires an LEA, before identifying a school for improvement (or for failure to make AYP after identification for corrective action, or for restructuring due to failure after corrective action), give the school an opportunity to review school-level data and present evidence. Requires each school identified for improvement, after such review is resolved, to develop or revise a two-year school plan in consultation with parents, school staff, the LEA, and outside experts. Requires such plans to include a mentoring program for teachers. Requires LEAs to provide specified types of technical assistance to schools identified for improvement.Requires an LEA, for any school served under I-A that fails to make AYP by the end of the first full school year after identification for improvement, to: (1) continue to provide technical assistance to the school and the public school transfer option to all the school's students; and (2) make tutoring and other supplemental educational services available to eligible low-income children. Allows such supplemental educational services to be provided by an LEA, nonprofit entity, or for-profit entity that: (1) has a demonstrated record of effectiveness in increasing student academic achievement; (2) can provide such services consistent with the LEA's instructional program and the academic standards described in the State's plan; and (3) is financially sound. Requires such providers to agree to various criteria, including all content and instruction provided through such services are secular, neutral, and nonideological.Requires LEAs to promptly notify parents of students in schools identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring.Requires LEAs to implement systems of corrective actions for schools identified for improvement. Requires LEAs, by the end of the second full school year after such identification, to: (1) continue to provide all students enrolled in the school with the option to transfer to another public school served by the LEA; (2) continue to provide specified types of technical assistance while instituting any corrective action; (3) continue to make supplemental educational services available to children who remain in the school; and (4) identify the school for corrective action. Requires the LEA, in the case of a school identified for corrective action, to do at least one of the following: (1) replace the school staff who are relevant to the failure to make AYP; (2) institute and fully implement a new curriculum, including providing appropriate professional development for all relevant staff, that is based on scientifically based research and offers substantial promise of improving educational achievement for low-achieving students and enabling the school to make AYP; (3) significantly decrease management authority at the school level; (4) appoint an outside expert to advise the school on its progress toward making AYP, based on its school plan; (5) extend the school's school year or school day; or (6) restructure the school's internal organizational structure.Allows the LEA to delay for not more than one year implementation of requirements relating to failure to make AYP after identification, corrective action, or restructuring, if: (1) a school makes AYP for one year; or (2) a school's failure to make AYP is due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the LEA or school.Requires LEAs to publish and disseminate information regarding any corrective action at a school to the public and to students' parents.Sets forth restructuring requirements for schools that continue to fail to make AYP after a full year of corrective action. Requires LEAS to: (1) continue to provide public school transfer options to all students enrolled there, as well as supplemental educational services for eligible children who remain in the school; and (2) plan and implement a major restructuring of the school's governance arrangement that makes fundamental reforms and has substantial promise of enabling the school to make AYP. Includes among such restructuring arrangements for a school: (1) reopening as a public charter school; (2) replacing all or most of the staff (which may include the principal) relevant to the AYP failure; (3) making a contract for operation of the public school by a public or private entity with a demonstrated record of effectiveness; or (4) SEA operation of the school. Directs the Secretary to provide technical assistance for such restructuring to certain small, rural LEAs that request it. Requires an LEA to promptly notify teachers and parents of students at a school to be restructured, and provide them adequate opportunity to comment on any such action and participate in developing any such plan.Prohibits an LEA from continuing to subject a school to requirements of school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring or to identify the school for school improvement for the succeeding school year, if the school makes AYP for two consecutive school years.Requires SEAs to provide: (1) technical assistance for school assessment and improvement; (2) annual review of LEA compliance with school assessment and improvement requirements; and (3) notice to the Secretary of schools or LEAs identified for improvement.Authorizes States to make certain rewards to LEAs that have exceeded AYP for two consecutive years.Requires States to identify for improvement LEAs that have failed to make AYP for two consecutive years. Requires such LEAs to make improvement plans. Directs each State to: (1) provide technical or other assistance to identified LEAs to develop and implement their plans and work with schools needing improvement; and (2) implement a system of corrective action for such LEAs. Requires States, if an LEA fails to make AYP after two school years after its identification, to continue technical assistance and to take at least one of the following corrective actions: (1) deferring programmatic funds or reducing administrative funds; (2) instituting and fully implementing a new curriculum that is based on State and local academic content and achievement standards, including providing appropriate professional development based on scientifically based research for all relevant staff, that offers substantial promise of improving educational achievement for low-achieving students; (3) replacing LEA personnel relevant to AYP failure; (4) removing particular schools from LEA jurisdiction, establishing alternative arrangements for such schools' public governance and supervision; and (5) appointing a receiver or trustee to administer LEA affairs in place of the superintendent and school board.Revises requirements for statewide systems school support, improvement, and recognition.Revises and renames I-B as Student Reading Skills Improvement Grants to: (1) establish programs for Reading First and Early Reading First initiatives, under new subparts 1 and 2; (2) revise and reauthorize the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs, under subpart 3; and (3) establish a subpart 4 program for Improving Literacy through School Libraries.Establishes, under I-B-1, the Reading First program to provide: (1) increased funding for improving classroom reading instruction; (2) assistance to SEAs and LEAs to establish scientific research-based reading programs for all children in kindergarten through grade three; and (3) professional development for teachers to identify children at-risk for reading failure and give effective early instruction to overcome specific barriers to reading proficiency. Allocates 80 percent of program funds to States based on poverty rates. Reserves 20 percent of program funds for two-year discretionary performance-based grants to States that reduce the number of children who cannot read. Allows States to use up to15 percent of the funds for professional development. Requires States to distribute at least 80 percent of funds to LEAs on a competitive basis with priority for high poverty areas in which there is a high percentage of students in grades kindergarten through three reading below grade level. Requires funds to be used for diagnostic assessments and instructional materials that include the essential components of reading instruction.Establishes, under I-B-2, the Early Reading First program of competitive grants for supporting enhanced reading readiness for children ages three through five in high poverty areas where there are high numbers of students who are not reading at grade level. Provides for development of verbal skills, phonemic awareness, pre-reading development, and assistance for professional development for teachers in child care centers or Head Start centers in instructional activities that would prepare children for formal reading instruction in kindergarten and grade one.Revises and reauthorizes, under I-B-3, the William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs.Sets forth the I-B-4 Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program, to provide students with increased access to up-to-date school library materials, well-equipped, technologically advanced school library media centers, and well-trained, professionally certified school library media specialists. Requires formula grants to SEAs if appropriations reach a specified level or, otherwise, competitive grants to eligible LEAs .Revises and reauthorizes I-C (Education of Migratory Children). Revises eligibility requirements for receiving funds, and provides States with increased flexibility in use of funds. Directs the Secretary to assist States in developing effective methods for the transfer of student records and for determining minimum data elements to be transferred.Revises, renames, and reauthorizes I-D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk). Requires States to set aside 15 percent (currently ten percent) of subpart 1 State Agency Programs funds for transition of youth in State correctional facilities back to their local schools.
