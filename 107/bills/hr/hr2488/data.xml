Designates specified Federal lands in Box Elder County, Utah, as wilderness (to be known as the Pilot Range Wilderness) and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.Requires any privately owned lands or interests within or abutting the Wilderness which are acquired by the United States to be added to and administered as part of such Wilderness. Authorizes such acquisition.Permits management activities to maintain or restore fish and wildlife populations and the habitats to support such populations to be carried out within the Wilderness.Directs the Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a memorandum of understanding to establish the procedures and guidelines for the use of the Wilderness, including those for ensuring immediate access to respond to emergency situations (including the rescue of personnel and the recovery of military aircraft or other weapons systems), determining the control of public access when necessary for national security or public safety purposes, and providing for the installation of temporary communications, instrumentation, or other equipment necessary for testing and training to meet military requirements. Prohibits military operations in the Dugway Proving Ground and in the Utah Test and Training Range from being restricted pending the completion of such memorandum of understanding.Continues to permit livestock grazing, where established prior to enactment of this Act, within the Wilderness.Declares that lands that are within the Pilot Range not designated as wilderness by this Act are no longer subject to the plan amendment process initiated by the Secretary.Withdraws Federal lands within the Wilderness from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the U.S. mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing and mineral materials.</summary>
