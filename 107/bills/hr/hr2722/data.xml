  <summary>11/28/2001--Passed House amended.
Clean Diamond Trade Act - Authorizes the President to prohibit imports of rough diamonds (with specified exceptions) into the United States from any country that does not take certain measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds as long as such prohibition is necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States (or pursuant to United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions on conflict diamonds), and is consistent with U.S. foreign policy interests, including its international obligations.(Sec. 5) Authorizes the President to prohibit specific entries of polished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds if the President has credible evidence that such polished diamonds and jewelry were produced with conflict diamonds.(Sec. 6) Sets forth both civil and criminal penalties for the import of prohibited diamonds and jewelry into the United States.(Sec. 7) Requires the President to report to Congress with respect to those countries that are involved in the export of conflict diamonds to the United States, including measures taken by the United States and such countries to ensure that such diamonds are not being imported into the United States.(Sec. 8) Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the provisions of this Act in preventing the importation of conflict diamonds into the United States.(Sec. 9) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should take the necessary steps to negotiate an international agreement to eliminate the trade in conflict diamonds and seek UN Security Council Resolutions for countries that are involved in conflicts linked to rough diamonds; (2) the provisions of this Act should not impede the trade in legitimate diamonds with countries that are working to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds, including through the negotiation of an effective international agreement to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds; and (3) companies involved in diamond extraction and trade should make financial contributions to countries seeking to implement measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds if such countries would have financial difficulty implementing such measures.(Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
