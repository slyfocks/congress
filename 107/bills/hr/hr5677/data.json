    "text": "Lasting Justice for Victims of 9/11 Act - Provides that the jurisdiction of a U.S. court shall not be barred in any action for money damages against a foreign state or other person for personal injury or death caused by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks: (1) on the grounds that the defendant is immune from suit as a foreign state or under any law extending diplomatic privileges or immunities; or (2) on the basis of provisions of the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 (the Fund Act) limiting air carrier liability. Sets a 25-year statute of limitations.Makes the Fund Act inapplicable to any action under this Act, except that if a person receives a money judgment in an action to which this Act applies, the court shall: (1) notify the Special Master appointed under the Fund Act who shall reduce the amount of compensation under such Act, if no payment under such Act has yet been made, by the amount of such judgment, less costs and attorneys fees; and (2) order the reimbursement of a specified amount to the U.S. Treasury if compensation has already been paid under such Act.Requires the heads of the appropriate U.S. departments and agencies to assist plaintiffs in enforcing any decision, judgment, or order issued in favor of plaintiffs in actions under this Act."
