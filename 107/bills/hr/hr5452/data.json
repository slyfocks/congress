    "text": "Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act - Provides that Cape Fox Corporation shall not be required under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to select or receive conveyance of 160 nonproductive acres. Permits Cape Fox to select and the Secretary of the Interior to convey 99 acres of the surface estate of Tongass National Forest lands outside Cape Fox's current exterior selection boundary. Directs the Secretary to convey the subsurface estate to those lands to Sealaska Corporation.Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to offer and, if accepted by Cape Fox, to exchange specified Tongass National Forest lands for lands and interests identified by Cape Fox from specified lands previously conveyed to it. States that the Cape Fox land conveyed to the Federal Government shall include a public trail easement unless the Secretary of Agriculture agrees otherwise.Requires the Secretary of the Interior, upon conveyance by Cape Fox of such lands and conveyance and relinquishment by Sealaska of the subsurface estate underlying those lands and other specified Tongass National Forest lands, to convey to Sealaska Tongass National Forest lands selected by Sealaska from a specified area. Requires: (1) such exchange to be considered a modification of the Sealaska Corporation/United States Forest Service Split Estate Exchange Agreement; and (2) conveyances under this Act by the Federal Government to be considered to be conveyances pursuant to ANCSA.Subjects Federal lands conveyed to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this Act to reservations of public easements only as mutually agreed to in the relevant exchange agreements, with such easements to be for access across the lands conveyed for use of national forests or other public land."
