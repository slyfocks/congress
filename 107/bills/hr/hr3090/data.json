Allows certain other property to qualify for such allowance under certain conditions if it has a recovery period of at least ten years or is transportation property.(Sec. 102) Extends the net operating loss carryback period from two to five years for such business losses arising between September 10, 2001, and September 11, 2004. Provides a temporary suspension of a specified limit on certain carryovers of such losses for purposes of an alternative tax deduction on them.Title II: Unemployment Assistance - Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 - Allows States to opt to enter into agreements for a program of temporary extended unemployment compensation (TEUC), which extends UC for up to an additional 13 weeks for individuals who have exhausted their 26 weeks of regular UC coverage.(Sec. 202) Sets forth TEUC program requirements for Federal-State agreements, coordination with other UC benefits, formulae for determining amounts in individual TEUC accounts and weekly benefits, payments to States, and financing.Requires the State agencies that opt to make TEUC agreements to make them to individuals who: (1) either first exhausted all rights to regular compensation under State or Federal law with respect to a benefit year (excluding any benefit year ending before March 15, 2001); and (2) do not have any rights to regular compensation under the State law of any other State, and are not receiving compensation under the unemployment compensation law of any other country.(Sec. 208) Applies TEUC agreements with States to weeks of unemployment: (1) beginning on or after the first day of the first week after the date on which such agreement is entered into; and (2) ending before January 6, 2003.(Sec. 209) Amends the Social Security Act to provide for a special transfer of funds in FY 2002 from the Federal unemployment account to State accounts in the Unemployment Trust Fund.Title III: Tax Incentives for New York City and Distressed Areas - Amends the IRC to expand work opportunity tax credit targeted categories to include certain New York Liberty Zone business employees, with respect to the period between September 10, 2001, and January 1, 2003, as members of a targeted group.

and (2) the dependent care tax credit.Title V: Social Security Held Harmless; Budgetary Treatment of Act - Provides that this Act shall have no impact on the Social Security trust funds.(Sec. 502) Designates certain amounts under this Act as emergency requirements under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.Title VI: Extensions of Certain Expiring Provisions - Extends various expiring IRC provisions, including: (1) the allowance of nonrefundable personal credits against regular and minimum tax liability; (2) the credit for qualified electric vehicles; (3) the credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources; (4) the work opportunity credit; (5) the welfare-to-work credit; (6) the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles and certain refueling property; (7) taxable income limit on percentage depletion for oil and natural gas produced from marginal properties; (8) qualified zone academy bonds; (9) cover over of tax on distilled spirits; (10) availability of medical savings accounts; (11) incentives for Indian employment and property on Indian reservations; and (12) a revised subpart F exemption for active financing.(Sec. 610) Amends the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002 (Public Law 107-116) to extend to health benefits or services furnished through December 31, 2003 (currently 2002) provisions of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (which requires health plans, under ERISA and the Public Health Service Act, and IRC, with certain exceptions, to treat equally for mental and physical health coverage their limits on annual payments and on lifetime payments).(Sec. 611) Sets forth temporary special rules under the IRC for taxation of life insurance companies.(Sec. 615) Repeals a requirement for approved diesel or kerosene terminals.(Sec. 616) Reauthorizes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) supplemental grants for population increases under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act for FY 2002.(Sec. 617) Provides for a one-year extension of the contingency fund under the TANF program."
