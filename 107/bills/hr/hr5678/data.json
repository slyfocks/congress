Includes among such adjustment assistance benefits continued health care coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and other Federal employee health care programs.Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program under which 75 percent of the premium for COBRA continuation coverage is provided for such individuals (with certain coverage limits and program requirements).Authorizes States to elect to provide temporary coverage under Medicaid programs for: (1) uninsured individuals who experience such separation from employment; or (2) the unsubsidized portion of COBRA continuation premiums for such individuals.Provides temporary extended unemployment compensation coverage for such individuals.Directs the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security to: (1) provide a preference for the hiring of such individuals as security screeners; and (2) carry out a program of performance incentive awards to Federal Security Managers to encourage the hiring of such employees."
