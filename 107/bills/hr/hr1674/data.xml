  <summary>5/2/2001--Introduced.
Access to Emergency Medical Services Act of 2001 - Requires a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer that provides any emergency services benefits (including ambulance services) to cover such services: (1) without prior authorization; (2) whether or not the health care provider furnishing such services is a participating provider; (3) in a manner so that if such services are provided by a nonparticipating provider, the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is not liable for amounts that would exceed those of a participating provider; and (4) without regard to any other term or condition of such plan or coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, a specified affiliation or waiting period, and applicable cost sharing).Requires such plan or issuer, in the case of non-emergency maintenance or post-stabilization care services, to provide for reimbursement for services provided by nonparticipating providers in a manner consistent with specified guidelines under the Social Security Act or as the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish.Requires plans and issuers to make information regarding emergency services coverage available annually.Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code to deem requirements of this Act to be incorporated into such Acts and the Internal Revenue Code.</summary>
