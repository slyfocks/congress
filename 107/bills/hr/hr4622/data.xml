Gateway Communities Cooperation Act of 2002 - Requires the National Park Service, United States Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management to: (1) provide for public involvement by government officials of local gateway communities (communities adjacent to or near public lands) in the development of land use plans, programs, regulations, and decisions, transportation plans, general management plans, and any other public land plans, decisions, projects, or policies that will have a significant impact; (2) provide such communities with early public notice of such proposed decisions; (3) offer training sessions for officials for understanding and participating in agency planning processes; (4) assign an employee or contractor to work with such a community to develop data and analysis relevant in the preparation of agency plans, decisions, and policies; and (5) assist in conducting a review of plans likely to affect such community.Allows a Federal land manager to enter into a cooperative agreement with gateway communities to provide for coordination between Federal, State, local, and tribal governments in land use inventory, planning, and management activities.Requires, to the extent practicable, the consolidation and coordination of the plans and planning processes of two or more Federal agencies to facilitate an affected gateway community's participation.Requires the Federal land agencies to, as soon as practicable (but not later than the scoping process), actively solicit the participation of gateway communities as cooperating agencies when a proposed action is determined to require the preparation of an environmental impact statement.Allows a Federal land manager to make grants to enable an eligible gateway community (population 10,000 or less) to: (1) participate in Federal land planning or management processes; (2) obtain professional land use or transportation planning assistance necessary as a result of Federal action; (3) address and resolve public infrastructure impacts that are a likely result of the Federal land management decisions and for which sufficient funds are not otherwise available; and (4) provide information and interpretive services.Provides for funding for grants from the following sources: (1) general land agency funds; (2) funds available to a Federal land manager for planning, construction, or project development; and (3) funds combined by Federal land managers from different Federal land agencies.</summary>
