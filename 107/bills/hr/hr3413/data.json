Requires such plans to designate a primarily responsible State official.Requires the Secretary to establish within the Center for Mental Health Services a National Mental Health Crisis Response Technical Assistance Center to provide technical assistance during emergencies and for developing and implementing plans and policy guidelines. Requires such Center to conduct training and serve as the principal clearinghouse for information concerning the mental health aspects of public health emergencies.Directs the Secretary to award grants for training mental health professionals to treat individuals who are victims of disasters."
