Prohibits their award for products that comply with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards, absent material and knowing misrepresentation by those submitting required approval or clearance information to the FDA.Authorizes periodic payment of future damages to claimants.Excludes suits for vaccine-related death or injury from the requirements of this Act if otherwise covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.Preempts State law unless it imposes greater protections for health care providers and organizations from liability, loss, or damages.Prohibits construction of this Act to create a cause of action against a Medicare+Choice plan under SSA title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice)."
