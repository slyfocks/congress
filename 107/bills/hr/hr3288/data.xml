  <summary>11/14/2001--Introduced.
Fairness in Antitrust in National Sports (FANS) Act of 2001 - Amends the Clayton Act to provide that the conduct, acts, practices, or agreements (conduct) of persons in the business of organized professional major league baseball directly relating to or affecting the elimination or relocation of a major league baseball franchise are subject to the antitrust laws to the same extent that such conduct would be subject to such laws if engaged in by persons in any other professional sports business affecting interstate commerce.Declares that: (1) no court shall rely on the enactment of this Act as a basis for changing the application of the antitrust laws to any other conduct; and (2) this Act does not create, permit, or imply a cause of action by which to challenge under the antitrust laws, or otherwise apply the antitrust laws to, any conduct that does not directly relate to or affect the elimination or relocation of a major league baseball franchise.Grants standing to bring action under this Act based on such violation to any person (including any major league or minor league baseball player; any Federal, State, or local government, and any stadium authority) injured by a violation of this Act.</summary>
