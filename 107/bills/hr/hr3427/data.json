Authorizes the Broadcasting Board of Governors to increase Voice of America broadcasts into Afghanistan and to use Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to create \"Radio Free Afghanistan\" broadcasts in local languages.Authorizes the President to disburse additional humanitarian aid to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003, to be distributed equitably and to include assistance for Afghan refugees in Central Asia. Expresses the sense of Congress that development aid should be targeted toward refugees, women, and the urban and rural poor, and that emphasis for all aid should be placed on needs of women and children, particularly girls.Authorizes the President to disburse assistance for a multinational security force in Afghanistan, and to make a donation to the United Nations Drug Control Program to combat trafficking in illicit drugs in Afghanistan, particularly heroin. Directs the President to institute economic sanctions against governments not complying with specific United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning the former Taliban government of Afghanistan."
