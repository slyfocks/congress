  <summary>5/3/2001--Introduced.
Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act - Amends Federal aviation law to make it an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition for a domestic or foreign air carrier to: (1) fail to provide a consumer full access to all the carrier's fares; (2) fail to disclose, without request, the on-time performance and cancellation rate for a chronically delayed or chronically canceled flight whenever a customer makes a reservation or purchases a ticket on such a flight; and (3) prohibit a customer from only using a portion of the ticket purchased (including using it only for one-way travel instead of round-trip) or assess an additional fee on such customer or any ticket agent that sold the ticket.Makes it an unfair or deceptive practice or an unfair method of competition for an air carrier, in the case of a termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or substantial change in the competitive circumstances of the appointment of a ticket agent, to fail: (1) to provide written notice and a full statement of reasons at least 90 days before the action; and (2) to provide the ticket agent with at least 60 days to correct any deficiency.Specifies requirements and prohibitions with respect to airline passenger protection.Requires the Secretary of Transportation to consider whether a foreign air carrier has engaged in any unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition in the preceding five years before issuing the carrier a certificate.Extends certain prohibitions against unfair methods of competition to any major air carrier that: (1) restricts a code share partner from entering into a code share agreement with another air carrier; (2) fails to utilize airport assets fully; and (3) refuses or fails to provide an underutilized airport asset to another carrier on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms.Prescribes a maximum civil penalty for engaging in unfair methods of competition.Authorizes an air carrier to transfer a slot (take-off and landing rights at an airport) to another air carrier only upon the Secretary's approval.Requires a major air carrier, upon application by another air carrier or on the Secretary's own motion, to make gates, facilities, and other assets available to other air carriers on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms.Directs the Secretary to investigate each hub airport (that has at least .25 percent of the total annual boardings in the United States) to determine whether, in the preceding five years, a dominant air carrier (that accounts for more than 40 percent of the total annual passenger boardings) at such airport has: (1) charged higher than average fares; or (2) limited competition by, or engaged in an unfair method of competition in response to, a new entrant air carrier.Directs the Secretary to issue final regulations defining flight delay and chronically delayed flights.</summary>
