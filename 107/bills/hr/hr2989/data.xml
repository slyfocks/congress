  <summary>10/2/2001--Introduced.
Airline Workers Fairness Act - Requires procedures that ensure the fair and equitable resolution of labor integration issues in certain transactions for the combination of air carriers which were pending or had been completed during the period from January 1, 2001 to September 11, 2001, and which did not result in the creation of a single air carrier by September 11, 2001.Requires specified labor protective provisions, which were imposed by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the Allegheny-Mohawk merger, to apply to covered employees of the covered air carrier, in any covered transaction that leads to the combination of crafts or classes that are subject to the Railway Labor Act. Requires the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to govern the process of seniority integration where such agreement provides for application of such labor protective provisions in such process. Provides for enforcement of this Act in Federal district courts.</summary>
