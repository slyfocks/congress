  <summary>10/16/2001--Passed House amended.
Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act of 2001 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to replace provisions regarding grants to develop alternative methods of punishment for young offenders with provisions authorizing the Attorney General to provide grants to promote greater accountability in the juvenile justice system, including grants to: (1) develop, implement, and administer graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders; (2) build, expand, renovate, or operate juvenile facilities; (3) hire juvenile court judges, probation officers, and court-appointed defenders and special advocates and to fund pretrial services (including mental health screening and assessment) for juvenile offenders; (4) provide funding to enable prosecutors to address drug, gang, and youth violence problems more effectively and for technology, equipment, and training; (5) establish and maintain programs designed to enhance school safety, restorative justice programs (i.e., programs that emphasize the moral accountability of an offender toward the victim and the affected community, which may include community reparations boards, restitution in the form of monetary payment or service to the victim or the affected community, and mediation between victim and offender), and programs to enable juvenile courts and juvenile probation officers to be more effective in holding juvenile offenders accountable and reducing recidivism; and (6) hire and provide training programs for detention and corrections personnel.Sets forth State and local grant eligibility requirements, which may include: (1) information about the proposed activities and the activity effectiveness assessment criteria; and (2) assurances that the local government has or, within one year, shall have in effect a system that ensures that sanctions are imposed on a juvenile offender for each delinquent offense and those sanctions escalate in intensity with each subsequent, more serious offense, there is sufficient flexibility to allow for individualized sanctions and services, and appropriate consideration is given to public safety and victims of crime.Sets forth provisions regarding the discretionary use of sanctions (including a reporting requirement if graduated sanctions are not used) and the allocation and distribution of funds (with not less than 75 percent of amounts received by each State distributed among local governments).Directs the Attorney General to issue guidelines establishing procedures under which a State or specially qualified local government that receives funds is required to provide notice to the Attorney General regarding the proposed use of funds. Specifies the membership of an advisory board to be established by State or local governments, including a nonprofit, nongovernmental victim advocacy organization.Requires a State or specially qualified local government unit to repay unexpended amounts to the Attorney General before the expiration of the 36-month period beginning on the date of the award, providing for a one-time extension of up to 12 months.Sets the Federal share of the grant at 90 percent of total program costs. Prohibits the Federal share from exceeding 50 percent of the approved cost of constructing juvenile detention or correctional facilities.Requires grant and sub-grant assessment reports to the Attorney General (with a waiver provision) and to Congress.Directs the Attorney General to make grants to Indian tribes, or consortia of tribes, for programs to strengthen tribal juvenile justice systems and to hold tribal youth accountable.Specifies that each Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant award shall remain available to the recipient for not more than 36 months.</summary>
