Requires, for the change to take effect, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to publish in the Federal Register a determination that the on-budget budget of the Government has been in balance or surplus for at least one year and that applying marriage penalty relief will not produce an on-budget deficit in the fiscal year in which it takes effect."
