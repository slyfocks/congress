Authorizes the Attorney General, if an individual who has applied for or is receiving a Federal public benefit may have been such a participant, to provide an opportunity for a hearing on the record with respect to the matter.Requires an immigration judge who finds that the respondent has been a participant in Nazi persecution to: (1) promptly issue an order declaring the respondent to be ineligible for any Federal public benefit and prohibiting any person from providing such a benefit to the respondent; and (2) transmit a copy of the order to any governmental entity or person known to be providing such a benefit.Authorizes the Attorney General to review any finding or conclusion made or order issued and to complete such review within 30 days (otherwise such finding, conclusion, or order shall be final).Provides for the appeal of findings or orders by an aggrieved party to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit."
