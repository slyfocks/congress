Directs qualified tribal governments, to receive such assistance, to enter into memoranda of understanding with the Secretary regarding use of the assistance.Requires funds allocated to qualified States to be used for local and regional projects.Permits the use of assistance outside the jurisdiction of the recipient if the assisted activity will provide conservation benefits to naturally produced salmon in streams of concern to the recipient.Requires States to match, in the aggregate, financial assistance provided under this Act.(Sec. 4) Directs States seeking assistance under this Act to establish citizens advisory committees or other similar fora for the public to participate in obtaining and using assistance under this Act. Requires qualified tribal governments to hold public meetings to receive recommendations on the use of such assistance.(Sec. 5) States that specified Federal interagency consultation requirements of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 shall not be required based solely on the provision of financial assistance under this Act.(Sec. 6) Sets forth reporting requirements.(Sec. 7) Includes: (1) Lahontan cutthroat trout and bull trout within the definition of \"salmon\" for purposes of applying this Act in Oregon; and (2) bull trout within such definition for purposes of applying this Act in Washington and Idaho.(Sec. 8) Directs the President to: (1) determine the number of United States citizens who served as employees of the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission or the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission and who worked in Canada in the course of employment with that commission; (2) calculate for each such employee the difference between the value, in United States currency, of the annuity payments made and to be made (determined by an actuarial valuation) by or on behalf of each such commission to the employee and the value, in Canadian currency, of such annuity payments; and (3) by not later than September 1, 2001, submit to the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate a report on such determinations and calculations.(Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations through 2004 to carry out this Act.(Sec. 10) Expresses the sense of Congress that, in the case of any equipment or products that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided under this Act, entities receiving such assistance should, in expending the assistance, purchase only equipment and products made in the United States.
