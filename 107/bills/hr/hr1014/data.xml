Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations governing the design, manufacture, performance of, and commerce in, handgun discharge protection products to reduce or prevent unreasonable risk of injury to children from the unintentional discharge of handguns. Requires a minimum safety standard that ensures that such a product: (1) is of adequate quality and construction to prevent children from operating a handgun; and (2) cannot be removed except through the use of a key, combination, or other method of access made possible by the manufacturer. Directs the Secretary to: (1) consider products that are not detachable but are permanently installed and incorporated into the design of a handgun; and (2) consider using test protocols relating to poison prevention packaging standards.Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) require the manufacturer to recall, repair, replace, or provide refunds with respect to, a handgun discharge protection device which has been designed, manufactured, transferred, or delivered in violation of this Act; and (2) make inspections to ascertain compliance.Prohibits: (1) a licensed manufacturer or importer from selling, transferring, or delivering to any person any handgun without a product that meets the standard; and (2) a licensed dealer from selling, transferring, or delivering to any person any handgun without the product supplied to the dealer by the licensed manufacturer or importer. Makes exceptions for Federal, state, and local governments.Requires warning labels for handguns. Provides for enforcement of this Act through civil penalties, firearms license revocation, a private right of action, and criminal penalties.Allows State law to afford greater protection to children regarding handguns than is afforded by this Act.</summary>
