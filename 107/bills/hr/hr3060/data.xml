  <summary>11/13/2001--Passed House without amendment.
Emergency Securities Response Act - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the emergency order authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as it determines necessary to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the substantial disruption of: (1) securities markets, investment companies, or any other significant portion or segment of such markets; or (2) the transmission or processing of securities transactions. Extends the duration of such order from the current ten-day maximum to 30 business days unless the SEC finds that the emergency still exists and that further extension is in the public interest and necessary for investor protection. Establishes 90 calendar days as the maximum duration of an SEC emergency order.</summary>
