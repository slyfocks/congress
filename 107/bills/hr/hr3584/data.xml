  <summary>12/20/2001--Introduced.
Medicare+Choice Improvement and Stabilization Act of 2001 - Amends part C (Medicare+Choice) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to make each annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a contract year equal to the largest of the amounts specified under current law or, for 2003, 100 percent of the fee-for-service costs for the Medicare+Choice payment area for services covered under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance) or B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) for individuals entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B who are not enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan under this part for the year.Revises the calculation of the national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate used in determining the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for calculation of annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates for 2003.Eliminates budget neutrality in such calculation for a year other than 2003. Modifies requirements for establishment of standards (other than solvency standards) for provider-sponsored organizations for Medicare+Choice organizations and plans in relation to State laws to avoid duplicative State regulation.Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a demonstration program under which payment rules for Medicare+Choice organizations are modified in order to promote: (1) the offering of Medicare+Choice plans by preferred provider organizations, of Medicare+Choice plans that provide point-of-sale coverage for other than participating providers, and of MSA plans: and (2) the use of disease management programs by Medicare+Choice plans.Amends SSA title XVII part C to: (1) suspend the limitation for program reentry for Medicare+Choice organizations for 2003 and 2004; and (2) set forth rules governing specialized Medicare+Choice plans for special needs beneficiaries.Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 to provide for extension of municipal health service demonstration projects.</summary>
