Instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish such standards for each such entity that has not established a net metering program conforming to such standards within two years after enactment of this Act.Sets forth minimum Federal standards for State and other net metering programs including: (1) metering and costs; (2) rates; and (3) safety and performance criteria.Authorizes States to establish additional requirements.Provides that a net metering credit under the net metering program shall not be considered a wholesale transaction for purposes of Federal or State law."
