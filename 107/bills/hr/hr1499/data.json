Requires all eligible students to meet the citizenship and immigration status requirements described in the Higher Education Act of 1965.Amends the Act: (1) to allow individuals who attend private historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) nationwide (currently, HBCUs whose main campuses are located in Maryland and Virginia) to participate in such Tuition Assistance Program; and (2) to prohibit the Mayor from using more than seven percent of the total amount of Federal funds appropriated for such Program, retroactive to the Act's enactment, for the Program's administrative expenses.Expresses the sense of Congress that the District of Columbia may appropriate such local funds as necessary for the Program.Requires the District government to establish a dedicated account for the Resident Tuition Support Program that shall consist of the Federal funds appropriated to the Program in this Act and any subsequent appropriations, any unobligated balances from prior fiscal years, and any interest earned in this or any fiscal years. Authorizes the use of such funds to help pay the cost of tuition and fees for eligible students to attend eligible institutions if the fiscal year appropriation for that year is insufficient to cover the cost of tuition and fees for that year."
