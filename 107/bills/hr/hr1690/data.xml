Export-Import Bank HIV/AIDS Medicine Access Promotion Act - Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to prohibit the Export-Import Bank of the United States from guaranteeing, insuring, or extending credit in connection with the export of any good or service by or to a restrictive company (or parent or any subsidiary) that: (1) is challenging the validity of a qualified HIV/AIDS access law or policy in a court of law; (2) is a complaining party with respect to the law or policy, pursuant to any provision of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, or any provision of any other international agreement relating to intellectual property rights; or (3) has made a formal complaint, which has not been withdrawn, to the United States Trade Representative about such law or policy. Defines "qualified HIV/AIDS access law or policy" as a law or government policy of a developing country with respect to intellectual property which has the effect of regulating the use of a pharmaceutical or technology that may be used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or an associated opportunistic disease, and which promotes access to the pharmaceutical or technology by the population of such country.</summary>
