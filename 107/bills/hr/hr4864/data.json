    "text": "Anti-Terrorism Explosives Act of 2002 - (Sec. 2) Rewrites Federal criminal code provisions regarding the purchase of explosives to prohibit the transport, shipment, or receipt of explosive materials without a Federal license, user permit, or limited permit. (Current law regulates such activities only to the extent that they occur in interstate or foreign commerce, includes exceptions such as for contiguous State transactions, and makes no mention of a limited permit.)Allows a limited permit purchaser to buy explosive materials only four times in any 12-month period. Makes each limited permit valid for one year.Requires employers who apply for licenses and user permits or limited permits to provide the names and appropriate identifying information regarding all employees who will be authorized by the employer to possess explosive materials, as well as fingerprints and a photograph of each responsible person. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to determine whether explosives possession by the responsible person or the employee would be unlawful and, if: (1) lawful, to notify the employer in writing or electronically of the determination and issue a letter of clearance; and (2) unlawful, to notify the employer and issue a document which confirms the determination, explains the grounds, provides information on how the disability may be relieved, and explains how the determination may be appealed.Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain an electronic record of each license, user permit, or limited permit issued or renewed on or after one year after this Act's effective date.(Sec. 3) Expands the list of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing explosive materials to include: (1) aliens other than lawful permanent resident aliens; (2) persons dishonorably discharged from the armed forces; and (3) individuals who have renounced their U.S. citizenship.(Sec. 4) Requires licensed manufacturers, licensed importers, and those who manufacture or import explosive materials or ammonium nitrate to furnish samples and relevant information when required by the Secretary.(Sec. 5) Sets penalties for the destruction of property of institutions receiving Federal financial assistance."
