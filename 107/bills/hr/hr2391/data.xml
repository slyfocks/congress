  <summary>6/28/2001--Introduced.
Prohibits a Federal agency from issuing or enforcing any rule that may be applied to restrict the transportation or possession of a firearm at a location on a public Federal road unless: (1) the rule is less restrictive than or equally restrictive as applicable State laws and rules; or (2) the Secretary of Defense, for reasons of national defense, determines that such prohibition should not apply (in which case the Secretary shall post signs that give conspicuous notice of the restrictions at the affected locations).</summary>
