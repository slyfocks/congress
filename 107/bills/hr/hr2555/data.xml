Provides that the program under which Federal agencies may agree to repay student loans of their employees shall apply to employees of the legislative branch (with the exception of Senators, Members of Congress, including Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner to Congress), except that: (1) requirements relating to the exclusion of any employee who occupies a position that is excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character shall not apply; and (2) the minimum required period of service shall be one year (rather than three) for a legislative branch employee selected to receive benefits.</summary>
