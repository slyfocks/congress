Exempts from such prohibition certain franchises or sales contracts entered into before October 17, 2000. Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations of this Act.Instructs the Federal Trade Commission to: (1) issue regulations requiring full disclosure by refiners and distributors of their wholesale motor fuel pricing policies, with a separate listing of each component contributing to prices, including the cost of crude oil, refining, marketing, transportation, equipment, overhead, and profit, along with a description of any rebates, incentives, and market enhancement allowances; and (2) ensure that all information acquired pursuant to such regulations is disseminated to the public.</summary>
