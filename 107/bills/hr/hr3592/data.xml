  <summary>12/20/2001--Introduced.
Hurricane, Tornado, and Related Natural Hazards Research Act - Requires the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish an Interagency Group to be responsible for the development and implementation of a coordinated Federal windstorm and related natural hazards reduction research, development, and technology transfer program (the Windstorm and Related Natural Hazard Impact Reduction Program) based on identified public needs to achieve major measurable reductions in losses within ten years.Requires that such program feature: (1) pertinent basic and applied research that takes into account locality-specific weather, susceptibility to natural hazards, design and construction practices, and performance of the built environment during windstorms and related natural hazards; (2) systematic collection of data for buildings and other structures for use in developing and deploying mitigation measures; (3) an ongoing program of information dissemination on cost-effective and affordable hazard reduction research results and hazard-resistant building construction techniques to industry, State and local governments, and the general public; and (4) improved technology for loss estimation, risk assessment, hazard identification, prediction, warnings, advanced planning, and disaster response.Requires the Interagency Group to develop and submit to Congress a ten-year implementation plan.Requires the Director to prepare, with other program agencies, an annual program budget.Establishes a National Advisory Committee to review progress made under the Program, advise on any improvements, and report to Congress on actions that have been taken to advance the Nation's capability to reduce windstorm and related natural hazard impacts.</summary>
