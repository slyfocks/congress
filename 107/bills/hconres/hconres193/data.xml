  <summary>7/23/2001--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior should direct the members of the U.S. delegation to the International Whaling Commission to: (1) remain diligent in their efforts to protect the ability of Native people of the United States who have been issued quotas by the Commission to continue to legally harvest whales; (2) support positions that are based on sound science; (3) oppose designation of the South Pacific Sanctuary or any other large-scale sanctuary until such time as the Commission's Scientific Committee issues scientific guidelines and criteria for the creation of sanctuaries, develops protocols for the monitoring of such sanctuaries, and develops a research program to determine whether sanctuaries meet the goals for which they were created; and (4) support speedy completion of any remaining portions of the Revised Management Scheme.</summary>
