  <summary>5/24/2001--Introduced.
Declares that Congress: (1) believes strongly that an economically stable Republic of Korea is in the best overall foreign policy and economic interests of the United States; (2) believes that economic policies and practices effectively limiting U.S. manufacturers' access to the Korean automotive sector are inconsistent with the general trend toward a market-oriented approach, and that the relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea has been, and will continue to be, significantly harmed by unfair treatment of imports of U.S. motor vehicles; (3) calls on the Republic of Korea to immediately end the practices that have led to the disparity in market access and to meet its commitments contained in the 1998 Memorandum of Understanding it signed with the United States; and (4) calls on the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of State to monitor and report to Congress on steps that have been taken to end the disparity in market access for imported U.S. motor vehicles in the Republic of Korea.</summary>
