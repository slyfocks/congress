  <summary>7/22/2002--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Forest Service and other Federal land management agencies should, among other specified actions, fully support the Collaborative Ten-year Strategy for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment as prepared by the Western Governors' Association, the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior, and other stakeholders, to reduce the overabundance of forest fuels that place these resources at high risk of catastrophic wildfire; (2) the Departments of Agriculture and of the Interior should immediately prepare for public review a national assessment of prescribed burning practices on public lands to identify alternatives that will achieve land management objectives to minimize risks associated with prescribed fire; and (3) results from such assessment should be incorporated into any regulatory land use planning programs that propose the use of prescribed fire as a management practice.</summary>
