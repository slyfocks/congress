  <summary>11/19/2001--Introduced.
Declares that Congress: (1) expresses its solidarity with Israel in using all appropriate methods to end terrorist violence against Israel and in its objectives to abolish terrorism; (2) recognizes that any resolution to the Palestinian homeland question can only be resolved so long as Israel's right to exist in security is fully respected; and (3) expresses concern that the Palestinian Authority has failed to effectively curb the incitement of violence which contributes to a wider acceptance of terrorism against innocent civilians or to respond quickly and forcefully to prevent acts of terrorism and to bring to justice those who have committed such acts.</summary>
