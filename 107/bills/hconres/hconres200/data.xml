  <summary>7/25/2001--Introduced.
Expresses opposition to the proposed retirement of 33 of the B-1 Lancer aircraft and consolidation of the operations of the remaining 60 such aircraft from five bases to two, as proposed by the Air Force, and calls for deferral of such actions during FY 2002 while Congress reviews the proposals. Expresses the sense of Congress that all procurement and research and development funds for the B-1 aircraft program in the FY 2002 budget for the Department of Defense should be reallocated to the Operations and Maintenance account for the Air National Guard, to be available for the continued operation of the 33 aircraft proposed to be retired.</summary>
