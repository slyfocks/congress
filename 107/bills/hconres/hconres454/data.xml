  <summary>7/26/2002--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative should work to support a fair and expeditious review and assure that no delays occur in resolving current disputes before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and World Trade Organization (WTO) trade dispute panels involving the imposition of special duties on imported softwood lumber from Canada; (2) U.S. antidumping and countervailing law is a rules-based system that should proceed to conclusion in WTO and NAFTA trade dispute panels; (3) the President should continue discussions with Canada to promote open trade between the two countries on softwood lumber free of trade restraints that harm consumers; and (4) the President should consult with all stakeholders, including consumers, in future discussions regarding such trade.</summary>
