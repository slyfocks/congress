  <summary>10/30/2001--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) renegotiation by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) of existing antidumping and safeguard provisions contained in the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (commonly known as the "Antidumping Agreement") is unnecessary and unlikely to result in an agreement that does not weaken the antidumping and safeguard provisions; and (2) the United States Trade Representative should oppose any changes to such provisions contained in the Antidumping Agreement at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the WTO to be held at Doha, Qatar, from November 9-13, 2001, and at any subsequent negotiations, including any changes that make antidumping relief under these provisions more difficult, uncertain, or costly for domestic industries to achieve and maintain over time.</summary>
