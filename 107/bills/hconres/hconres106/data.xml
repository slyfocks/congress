  <summary>4/25/2001--Introduced.
Commends the 24 crew members of the Navy EP-3 Aries II reconnaissance aircraft that was struck on April 1, 2001, by a fighter aircraft of the People's Republic of China for the conduct of their mission, for the operation of the aircraft after the collision, for their actions in minimizing sensitive national security information, and for their conduct while being detained.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the incident should not be the basis for a reduction in, or cessation of, lawful reconnaissance and surveillance flights in that area; (2) the U.S. aircraft now on Hainan Island, China, should be immediately returned to the United States; and (3) continued interception and aggressive tactics by Chinese pilots toward such lawful flights may undermine important relationships between the two countries.</summary>
