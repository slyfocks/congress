  <summary>12/12/2001--Passed House without amendment.
Keeping the Social Security Promise Initiative - Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security should present in its recommendations innovative ways to protect the immense financial commitment of every American worker into the Social Security system without lowering benefits or increasing taxes; and (2) the President and the Congress should join to develop legislation to strengthen Social Security as soon as possible, which should recognize the obstacles women face in securing financial stability at retirement or in cases of disability or death, the unique needs of minorities and the role Social Security plays in preventing poverty and providing financial security, and guarantee current law promised benefits without increasing taxes.</summary>
