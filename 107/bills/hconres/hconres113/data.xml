Urges the President to: (1) deny oil companies operating in Sudan the ability to raise capital or trade equities in the U.S. capital markets; (2) expand Executive Order 13067 (economic and trade sanctions on Sudan) by denying capital market opportunities to all publicly traded equities of all oil companies operating in Sudan; and (3) investigate possible violations of Executive Order 13067 by PetroChina in its Initial Public Offering on the New York Stock Exchange in April 2000.Calls upon: (1) all companies operating in Sudan to freeze oil production in Sudan and cease oil exports from Sudan until a peace agreement is reached in Sudan and other specified conditions are met; (2) the international community to boycott oil from Sudan and the foreign companies involved in the production and export of Sudanese oil; (3) companies contemplating entrance into Sudan's oil sector not to do so until a just peace is secured; and (4) U.S. companies and individuals who may have indirectly invested in companies involved in oil development in Sudan to divest their holdings.</summary>
