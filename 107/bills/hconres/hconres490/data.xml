  <summary>9/26/2002--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States must systematically reduce its reliance on foreign oil sources; (2) the United States must increase domestic oil exploration and production; (3) the United States must expedite the development of alternative fuel sources, particularly ethanol and biodiesel; (4) the United States must reevaluate its relationships with noncooperative, secretive regimes; and (5) our Nation should develop a long overdue comprehensive energy policy that promotes domestic energy research and development and provides for the security and diversity of the American energy supply.</summary>
