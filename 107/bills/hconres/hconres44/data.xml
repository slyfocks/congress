Recognizes hunting as a legitimate and necessary tool of wildlife resource management.Affirms the vital importance of lawful hunting, regulated by the various State departments in charge of natural resources and the Department of the Interior, in maintaining healthy populations of wildlife.Declares that no Federal law should be passed limiting the taking and consumptive use of wildlife, other than those reasonable laws to ensure the safety of hunters and the continued perpetuation of wildlife itself. Acknowledges exceptions, including laws designed to: (1) protect species that are in danger of extinction; (2) protect species which are not traditionally considered as game or suitable for consumptive use; and (3) ensure that hunting is carried out in a sportsmanlike manner.</summary>
