  <summary>4/30/2002--Passed House without amendment.
Declares the sense of the Congress that: (1) a National Minority Health and Health Disparities Month should be established to promote educational efforts on the health problems currently facing minorities and other health disparity populations; (2) the Secretary of Health and Human services should present public service announcements on health promotion and disease prevention among minorities and other health disparity populations in the United States, and educate the public and health care professionals about health disparities; (3) the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality should continue to collect and report data on health care access and utilization on patients by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and, where possible, primary language to monitor the Nation's progress toward the elimination of health care disparities; and (4) the information gained should be disseminated to all health care professionals so that they may better communicate with all patients, regardless of race or ethnicity, without bias or prejudice.</summary>
