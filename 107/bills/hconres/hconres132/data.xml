  <summary>5/10/2001--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative should make the promotion of cross-border trade via electronic commerce a high priority; (2) the United States should work with trading partners to develop a cross-border trade regime that promotes the continued growth of electronic commerce and advances the interests of Internet buyers and sellers in different countries; and (3) the United States should encourage members of the World Trade Organization to promote development of infrastructures necessary to conduct e-commerce, to ensure that products delivered electronically receive the most beneficial treatment possible under trade agreements, and to refrain from adopting measures that would constitute trade barriers to electronic commerce.</summary>
