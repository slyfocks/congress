  <summary>5/3/2001--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the embargo of Cuba should not be lifted until the Cuban Government agrees to decriminalize free speech, association, and movement, and other elements crucial to the development of democracy and the protection of fundamental human rights.Calls on the Cuban Government to: (1) immediately release all political prisoners in Cuba, including Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet; (2) eliminate all of Cuba's criminal laws that unnecessarily restrict the fundamental human rights to freedom of speech, association, and movement; and (3) respect fundamental human rights and free multiparty and internationally supervised elections in Cuba.</summary>
