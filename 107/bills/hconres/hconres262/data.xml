  <summary>11/7/2001--Passed House without amendment.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the President, at the upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) round of negotiations at Doha, Qatar, November 9-13, 2001, and at any subsequent round of WTO negotiations, should: (1) preserve the U.S. ability to enforce its trade laws rigorously, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and avoid agreements which lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping and subsidies, in order to ensure that U.S. workers, agricultural producers, and firms can compete fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of reciprocal trade concessions; and (2) ensure that U.S. exports are not subject to the abusive use of trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, by other countries.</summary>
