  <summary>4/17/2002--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that (1) physicians should screen all adolescents and all adult women presenting with severe menorrhagia for von Willebrand's disease; (2) hysterectomy for excessive menstrual bleeding should not be performed without the consideration of a bleeding disorder; (3) referral of women with bleeding disorders to a federally sponsored hemophilia treatment center is critical to comprehensive treatment; (4) physicians should be encouraged to conduct clotting factor assays for carrier diagnosis and to facilitate genotyping of the disorder and patients should be referred for genetic counseling when appropriate; (5) patient advocate organizations and medical specialty societies should continue to collaborate on public education campaigns to educate women about bleeding disorders; (6) the Federal Government has a responsibility to further research on von Willebrand's disease and improve access to hemophilia treatment centers for all individuals with bleeding disorders; (7) the Director of the National Institutes of Health should develop a 5-year research plan concerning women with bleeding disorders; and (8) the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should continue to improve outreach, treatment, and prevention of the complications of women's bleeding disorders.</summary>
