  <description>Amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Army should promptly correct the pay inequity in the provision of assignment incentive pay under section 307a of title 37, United States Code, to members of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve serving on active duty in Afghanistan and Iraq.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 8 printed in House Report 109-459 to express the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Army should promptly correct the pay inequity in its assignment incentive pay system. Depending on method of call to active duty, some Guardsmen and Reservists serving in the same unit in Iraq and Afghanistan will be eligible for assignment incentive pay ($1,000 extra per month) after reaching 730 days on active duty, while others will not. The Army must submit to Congress within 30 days after enactment a report specifying how many soldiers, both active and reserve, were affected by this pay disparity and proposed remedies or courses of action to correct the inequity.</purpose>
