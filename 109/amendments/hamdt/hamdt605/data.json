It also includes a clarification that makes clear that, in the anti-forum shopping provisions, if there is no State court in the county in which the injury occurred, the case can be brought in the nearest county where a court of general jurisdiction is located. The manager's amendment also makes clear that it does not affect personal injury claims that Federal bankruptcy law requires be heard in a Federal bankruptcy court.",
