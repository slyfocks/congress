  <purpose>An amendment numbered 1 printed in House Report 109-253 to include provisions imposing sanctions for the destruction of relevant documents in a pending Federal court proceeding; provisions for setting standards for a court's determination that certain court records should be sealed; and provisions providing for a presumption of a Rule 11 violation when the same issue is repeatedly relitigated. It also includes a clarification that makes clear that, in the anti-forum shopping provisions, if there is no State court in the county in which the injury occurred, the case can be brought in the nearest county where a court of general jurisdiction is located. The manager's amendment also makes clear that it does not affect personal injury claims that Federal bankruptcy law requires be heard in a Federal bankruptcy court.</purpose>
