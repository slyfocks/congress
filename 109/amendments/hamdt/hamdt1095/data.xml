  <description>Amendment sought to provide that, in a case in which a Federally funded flood control project causes an area to become at greater risk of flooding than it otherwise would have been, residents in that area shall be provided flood insurance using the price formula that would have applied had the offending flood control project not been built, or if no flood insurance would otherwise have been required, they shall be provided flood insurance at no cost.</description>
