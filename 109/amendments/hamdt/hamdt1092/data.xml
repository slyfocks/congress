  <description>Amendment clarifies that demolition and rebuilding should be a mitigation option available under the regular Flood Mitigation Assistance program.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 11 printed in House Report 109-530 to clarifiy that `demolish and rebuild' should be a mitigation option available under the regular Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) program. The `demolish and rebuild' option is specifically allowed under the Severe Repetitive Loss Program created by the 2004 reform act and FEMA has interpreted the difference to mean it cannot approve the measure under FMA.</purpose>
