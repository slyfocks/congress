  <description>Amendment sought to restore the current joint governance structure of the Head Start program by allowing the policy council to approve or disapprove most program planning and operation activities along with the board of directors.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 2 printed in House Report 109-229 to restore the current joint governance structure of the Head Start program by allowing the policy councils (which are composed of 51 percent current Head Start parents and 49 percent community representatives) to approve or disapprove most program planning and operation activities along with the board of directors. In the event of an impasse, the board and policy council would enter into a mediation process with a third party - as under current regulations. Gives the board the discretionary authority to act unilaterally without policy council approval in all cases involving serious fiscal management, fraud or criminal activity.</purpose>
