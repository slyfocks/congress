  "number": 494, 
  "purpose": "An amendment numbered 7 printed in part B of House Report 109-178 to change the reference in the forfeiture statute from 2331 (domestic terrorism) to 2332(b) and 2332b(g)(5)(B) (the federal crime of terrorism definition). The distinction between the two definitions is that one is supposed to be applied to criminal offenses and the other to administrative processes. Thus, the amendment removes the section that refers to seizing peoples' assets for people who are considered \"domestic terrorists.\" The amendment replaces the term \"domestic terrorism\" with \" federal crime of terrorism\" in this section. The federal crime of terrorism is a much more focused term which lists all terrorism crimes specifically, whereas people have complained that the term \"domestic terrorism\" is too broad.",
