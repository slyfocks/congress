Also requires the Secretary to establish a secure means for TSA personnel to communicate with FFDO's in support of their mission, issue badges to FFDO's within 180 days, set up a process by which pilots can appeal a TSA decision to revoke a FFDO's status, establish a pilot program to allow FFDO's to carry their weapon, and encourage the President to pursue international agreements that will allow the use of FFDO's on international flights.",
