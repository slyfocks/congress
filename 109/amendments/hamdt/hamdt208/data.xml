  <description>Amendment clarifies Federal law concerning what DOD support may be provided to youth organizations including the Boy Scouts of America.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 24 printed in House Report 109-96 to clarify federal law regarding support for youth organizations (including the Boy Scouts of America) by the federal government. The amendment also removes doubt that DoD may welcome Scouts to hold meetings and go camping on federal property. Specifically, the Department of Defense would have to provide a minimum level of support that it provided in the previous four fiscal years. The support is defined as holding meetings, camping events, or other activities on defense property and hosting any official event of the youth organization.</purpose>
