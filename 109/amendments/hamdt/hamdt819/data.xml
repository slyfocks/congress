  <description>Amendment sought to restructure missile defense programs by instructing the Secretary of Defense not to deploy any Ground-based Midcourse Defense System beyond the authorized systems that are now at Fort Greeley, Alaska and, the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, or deploy any space-based interceptors of intercontinental ballistic missiles; and sought to reduce Missile Defense Agency funding by $4.747 billion.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 22 printed in House Report 109-461 to restructure the missile defense program to be consistent with a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) alternative proposal; to prohibit the deployment of: (1) Ground-Based Midcourse Defense beyond the authorized systems; and (2) any space-based interceptors; and reduce the Missile Defense Agency's (MDA's) $9.3 billion budget by $4.747 billion so as to still enable the MDA to focus on research and development as well as testing and upgrades to current systems.</purpose>
