  <description>Amendment directs FEMA to utilize a statistically appropriate sampling method for claims reviews and quality assurance purposes.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 12 printed in House Report 109-530 to direct FEMA to utilize `a methodologically valid approach for sampling files selected for operational reviews and quality assurance claims reinspections.' A 2005 GAO study highlighted FEMA's oversight failures, stating that, `FEMA cannot . . . determine the overall accuracy of claims settled for specific flood events or assess the overall performance of insurance companies and their adjusters in fulfilling their responsibilities for the NFIP' (GAO-06-183T National Flood Insurance Program). Improves the oversight and accountability of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</purpose>
