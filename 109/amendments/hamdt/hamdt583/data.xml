  <description>Amendment provides for the reauthorization of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program through FY 2011.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 9 printed in House Report 109-236 to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) through FY2011 and would increase authorized funding to $750 million for FY06, $850 million for FY07, and $950 million for FY08-11; specifies that funds "may be used only for correctional purposes." Amendment also requires the Department of Justice Inspector General submit a report on the state and local governments that receive SCAAP funding and whether they are cooperating with efforts to deport criminal aliens, whether they have policies in violation of current law, and in the case of illegal aliens released without being referred to the Department of Homeland Security, the number of subsequent offense committed and how many of these aliens were released because the state or local governments lack space or funds to detain them.</purpose>
