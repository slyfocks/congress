  <purpose>An amendment numbered 16 printed in part B of House Report 109-178 to establish a new criminal offense of narco-terrorism, which prohibits any person from manufacturing, distributing or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance in schedule I or II or flunitrazepam or listed chemical, or attempting or conspiring to do so, knowing or intendingthat such activity, directly or indirectly, aids, or provides support, resources or anything of value to: (a) a foreign terrorist organization; or(b) any person or group involved in the planning, preparation for, or carrying out of a terrorist offense. The penalty for such an offense is a mandatory minimum of 20 years and a maximum of life. The provision states Congress' intent to establish broad extra-territorial jurisdiction to enforce this new criminal offense; and makes it clear that the government need not prove that the defendant knew that an organization is a designated`foreign terrorist organization.' The provision also defines the terms `anything of pecuniary value,' `terrorist offense,' and `terrorist organization.'.</purpose>
