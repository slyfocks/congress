Commends the restraint shown by Indian security forces in dealing with the armed insurgency. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) all intruding forces from across the Line of Control should withdraw from the Indian side; and (2) the letter and spirit of the Lahore Declaration should be respected by all parties, namely that both governments shall refrain from intervention and interference in each other's internal affairs and reaffirm their condemnation of terrorism and their determination to combat this menace."
