  <summary>10/10/2000--Passed House amended.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the European Union should continue to bear the primary responsibility and costs for the economic reconstruction of Kosova and should take all necessary steps to ensure that its future budgets provide the required resources in a timely fashion; (2) the administration of all baseline services such as police, sanitation, water, telecommunications, and electrical supply should be put in the hands of the people of Kosova at the earliest possible date; (3) the U.S. Government should make it a priority to promote noncorrupt government and business practices in Kosova by providing judicial training and technical advice and assistance to police, border police, and customs officers; (4) the United Nations Security Council should demand the immediate and unconditional return of all Kosova prisoners from Serbia; and (5) the international peacekeeping force in Mitrovice should take immediate measures to ensure that all the residents are able to return in security to their homes.Declares that: (1) the strategy for economic reconstruction in Kosova should be focused on utilizing private investment and empowerment of the people of Kosova; (2) all the citizens of Kosova should avail themselves of the opportunity to democratically express their political preferences by participating in the October 28, 2000, elections; (3) the resolve of the international community to work towards lasting peace, stability, and justice in Kosova will not be deterred by Slobodan Milosevic's provocations within the region; and (4) all citizens of Kosova should adhere to the principles enunciated by community leaders at the Airlie House declaration of July 23, 2000, where all parties agreed to a rigorous Campaign Against Violence, representation of all citizens in municipal councils, surrendering of illegal weapons, a commitment to counter Milosevic's influence in Kosova, and dissolution of any other illegitimate governing and security structures.</summary>
