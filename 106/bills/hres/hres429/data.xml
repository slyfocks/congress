  <summary>3/1/2000--Introduced.
Recognizes the right of the Austrian people to express their political views through a democratic election, but reaffirms the right and obligation of the U.S. House of Representatives to express its opposition to the anti-democratic, racist, and xenophobic views that have been expressed by Joerg Haider and other leaders of the FPO and to state its opposition to the party's participation in the Austrian Government.Condemns the insulting, racist, and xenophobic statements which have been made over many years by Haider and other leaders of the party. Expresses regret and dismay that the FPO will play a major role in the new Austrian Government. Commends the leaders of the European Union (EU), the 14 other member states of the EU, Canada, Norway, and other countries which have expressed their serious concerns regarding the participation of the FPO in such Government.Calls upon: (1) the President, the Secretary of State, and other U.S. Government officials and agencies to emphasize to Austrian Government officials the concern about the inclusion of any party in the Austrian Government, including the FPO, that has been associated with xenophobic, racist policies, and statements supportive of Nazi-era programs; (2) Members of Congress to use any meetings with ministers and other political leaders of that Government to express concern for Austria's continued adherence to democratic standards and full respect for human rights; and (3) the Secretary of State to continue to scrutinize the policies of the new Austrian Government and to be prepared to take additional measures if circumstances so warrant.</summary>
