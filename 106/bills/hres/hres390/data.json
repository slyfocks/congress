Affirms U.S. support for Angolan peace through continued direct engagement in the United States-Angola Bilateral Consultative Commission.Urges: (1) the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to suspend hostilities and to pledge to fulfill its commitments under the Lusaka Protocol, and the Angolan Government to suspend hostilities; (2) the United Nations (UN) to swiftly reestablish its presence in Angola under its new mandate to promote human rights protection and humanitarian action; (3) the warring parties immediately to establish peace corridors to facilitate the movement of humanitarian assistance to feed the more than 1 million internally displaced Angolan people; and (4) the United States to support financially and diplomatically the efforts of the UN Committee on Sanctions to identify and rein in all violators of sanctions against diamond and arms sales.Calls upon: (1) the international community to remain actively engaged in support of national reconciliation, removal of land mines, economic development, and democratization in Angola; (2) the Angolan Government to continue to implement elements of the Lusaka Protocol aimed at accelerating the democratic transition; (3) all parties to recognize and support the broadening and the implementation of the movement for peace which is emerging from religious and civil society organizations in Angola; and (4) the UN to work with the Southern Africa Development Community to develop a monitoring regime to interdict all supplies to UNITA and restrict illegal arms and diamond trafficking."
