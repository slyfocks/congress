  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Amends rule XXVI (limitations on outside earned income and acceptance of gifts) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to allow a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House to accept a gift (other than cash or cash equivalent) that the individual reasonably and in good faith believes to have a value of less than $50 and a cumulative value from one source during a calendar year of less than $100. Prohibits a gift having a value of less than $10 from being counted towards the $100 annual limit. Directs that individuals shall make a good faith effort to comply with these requirements even though formal recordkeeping is not required.</summary>
