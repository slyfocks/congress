  <summary>5/4/2000--Introduced.
Save Our Surplus for Debt Reduction and Tax Rebate Resolution of 2000 - Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that if the Office of Management and Budget, in its supplemental summary of the budget for FY 2001, projects an increase in the on-budget surplus from the projection for that surplus set forth in the President's budget submission for such fiscal year that: (1) is $16 billion or less for FY 2000, then such amount should be dedicated to reducing publicly- held debt; or (2) exceeds such amount for FY 2000, then $16 billion should be returned as a tax rebate distributed equally to every American household that paid Federal income taxes for taxable year 1998 and any excess should be dedicated to reducing such debt. Expresses the sense of the House that any individual receiving a tax rebate who desires to do so may return the check in order to reduce such debt.</summary>
