  <summary>9/28/2000--Introduced.
Declares that the House of Representatives supports the Secretary of Transportation's policy announced on December 18, 1995, to delay implementation of certain provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that allow increased access for Mexican trucks to U.S. roads. Recognizes compelling data reported by the Department of Transportation (DOT) Inspector General regarding the danger posed on both sides of the United States-Mexico border by unsafe Mexican trucks.Calls on the President to refuse access to U.S. roads outside the commercial zones along the United States-Mexico border to Mexican trucks that are currently restricted to these zones until the DOT Inspector General has certified that: (1) Mexican trucks and drivers are complying with standards of safety, environmental protection, and driver competency, licensing, and hours of service equivalent to standards that apply to U.S. trucks on U.S. roads; and (2) Mexican trucks inspected on entering the United States are passing inspection in the same percentage as Canadian trucks inspected on entering the United States.</summary>
