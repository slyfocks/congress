  <summary>10/6/2000--Introduced.
Condemns the decision by the Iranian Revolutionary Court to sustain the unjust imprisonment of the ten Jews improperly convicted on July 1, 2000, and urges their immediate release.Calls for: (1) the Government of Iran to fulfill its obligation to respect fundamental human rights; and (2) the cessation of unilateral gestures of good faith on the part of the United States absent significant and recognizable reciprocal actions by the Iranian Government.Commends the President, the Secretary of State, the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and the Secretary General of the United Nations for their diligence and urges them to continue their efforts to sustain international pressure on the Iranian Government to release these 12 men.Calls on the President to: (1) consider the fate of the 10 Jews and two Muslims imprisoned as a benchmark against which the intentions and good faith of the Iranian Government should be measured; and (2) sustain, and consider strengthening, existing U.S. sanctions against Iran. Urges the Secretary to direct all U.S. diplomatic personnel to promote international efforts to free the 12 falsely imprisoned Iranians.</summary>
