Urges the Economic Community Of Western African States to follow Senegal's lead and make efforts to promote democratic reforms and prevent future conflicts.Calls upon: (1) Senegal's newly elected President Wade to involve all Senegalese to accept the election results and move the country forward; (2) all factions within the Secessionist Movement of Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) to commit to a cessation of hostilities and create stability for its people; and (3) President Wade to continue the peace initiative started by President Diouf with MFDC.Recognizes Senegal as one of the first African states to adopt a multi-party system in the early 1980's and as a nation of democracy on a continent of one-party states and military dictatorships."
