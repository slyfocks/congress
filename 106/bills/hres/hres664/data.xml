  <summary>10/30/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that after seven months of delay the Administration should stop impeding the General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation into how it has applied its peacekeeping policy process to several ongoing United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations, and that the following recommendations would help to conclude the investigation: (1) the President should direct the Secretary of State and all other relevant Government officials to cooperate fully with the investigation; (2) GAO should consider taking enforcement action against the Administration for any continuing failure to provide requested documents; and (3) the Administration should provide to GAO the full text of any documents, policy papers, or memorandums that it has agreed to make available to any other member country of the UN General Assembly and should cooperate fully with GAO and with Congress in their efforts to oversee future U.S. participation in UN or other multilateral peacekeeping operations.</summary>
