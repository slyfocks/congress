  <summary>7/17/2000--Passed House amended.
Declares that the House of Representatives: (1) reiterates its condemnation of the attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July 1994, and honors the victims; and (2) desires a lasting, warm relationship between the United States and Argentina built on mutual abhorrence of terrorism and commitments to peace, stability, and democracy in the Western Hemisphere.Urges the Government of Argentina to pursue the local and international connections to such terrorist act and to duly punish all those who were involved.Calls on the President to: (1) continue to raise this issue in bilateral discussions with Argentine officials and to underscore U.S. concern regarding the six-year delay in the resolution of this case; and (2) direct U.S. law enforcement agencies to provide support and cooperation to such Government, if requested, for purposes of the investigation into this bombing and terrorist activities in the tri-border area.Recommends that the United States Representative to the Organization of American States seek support from countries comprising the Inter-American Committee Against Terrorism to assist, if required by that Government, in the investigation.</summary>
