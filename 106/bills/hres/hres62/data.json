Appeals to all parties to the conflict to engage in dialogue without preconditions. Supports the people of Sierra Leone in their quest for a democratic, stable country and a reconciled society. Urges the President, the Secretary of State, and the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs to support the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone and give high priority to helping resolve the conflict. Declares that the House of Representatives abhors the gross human rights violations ongoing in Sierra Leone, including the dismemberment of citizens by the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Demands that they immediately stop such acts. Condemns the West African countries and those outside the region that are aiding the AFRC-RUF. Demands that they immediately withdraw their combatants and cease providing assistance to the rebels. Applauds the Economic Community of West African States Military Observation Group (ECOMOG) for its support of the legitimate Government of Sierra Leone. Urges it to diversify its forces with troops from additional Economic Community of West African States countries and remain engaged in Sierra Leone until a comprehensive settlement of the conflict is achieved. Calls upon the United States to provide increased, appropriate logistical and political support for ECOMOG and for Ghana and Mali."
