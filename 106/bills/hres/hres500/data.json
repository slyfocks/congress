Urges the Government of Zimbabwe to enforce the rule of law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the political and civil rights of all citizens. Expresses support for international efforts to assist with land reform which are consistent with accepted principles of international law and which take place after the holding of free and fair parliamentary elections. Condemns government-directed violence against farm workers, farmers, and opposition party members. Encourages the local media, civil society, and all political parties to work together toward a campaign environment conducive to free, transparent and fair elections within the legally prescribed period. Recommends international support for voter education, domestic election monitoring, and violence monitoring activities. Urges the United States to continue to monitor violence and condemn brutality against law abiding citizens. Congratulates all the democratic reform activists in Zimbabwe for their resolve to bring about political change peacefully, even in the face of violence and intimidation. Recommends that the United States send a bipartisan delegation under the auspices of the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs to observe such election process in Zimbabwe. Expresses desire for a lasting, warm, and mutually beneficial relationship between the United States and a democratic, peaceful Zimbabwe."
