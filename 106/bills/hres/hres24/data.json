Urges: (1) Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and National Liberation Army guerrilla leaders, and the leaders of the paramilitary groups, to end the violence, sever their relationships with the narcotics trade, and negotiate a peace accord with the Colombian Government which would provide lasting peace, reaffirm democratic principles, and end the cultivation, production, and trade of narcotics; and (2) the international community to play a more proactive role in trying to resolve the internal conflict by encouraging all sides to participate in the peace process. Reaffirms U.S. support for the peace process. Commits the United States to assist the Colombian Government in finding a peaceful resolution and to continue U.S. assistance to help strengthen political stability, foster economic growth, and combat the drug trade within Colombia."
