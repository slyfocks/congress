  <summary>10/11/2000--Introduced.
Denounces the abstention by the United States from voting on Resolution 1322 (which condemns Israel for acts of violence and cites excessive force by Israelis against Palestinians and which was adopted by the United Nations (UN) Security Council on October 7, 2000). Calls upon the President to declare such resolution null and void as a matter of national policy. Condemns the UN Security Council for its one-sided condemnation of Israel.Urges: (1) the UN member states to vigorously oppose efforts to manipulate the Fourth Geneva Convention for the sole purpose of attacking Israel; and (2) Israeli and Palestinian leaders to seek a secure future for all citizens of the Middle East through a full and thorough peace process.</summary>
