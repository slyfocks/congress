  <summary>2/9/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives commending Michael Horowitz for his actions on February 2, 2000, in working to raise the knowledge of the American public about the conflict in Sudan and the lack of: (1) direct action on the part of the Administration to support those in the south who are fighting against the totalitarian northern regime in Khartoum; (2) involvement by the Administration in acting as an international voice of support for a comprehensive peace process; and (3) action taken by the Administration against companies such as Canada's Talisman Energy, Inc., which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and the proposed Initial Public Offer (IPO) of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for their involvement in oil ventures in Sudan, which seek to strengthen the power and financial capability of the Government of Sudan at the detriment of those in the south.</summary>
