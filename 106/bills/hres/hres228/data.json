    "text": "Commends: (1) the Colombian people for their continued demonstration of support for the democratic process as well as for an end to internal conflict; (2) President Andres Pastrana for his commitment to seek an end to the guerilla insurgency and paramilitary violence in Colombia and for his efforts to begin a peace process; and (3) the Colombian Government and military leadership for their initial steps toward removing from the armed forces officers found to be linked to illegal and unacceptable activities of paramilitaries. Condemns the violations of human rights, including murder and kidnappings, that continue in Colombia, particularly the murder by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas of three U.S. citizens, the disappearance of three U.S. missionaries of the New Tribes Mission in territory controlled by FARC, and the recent mass kidnappings and hijackings by the National Liberation Army (ELN) which resulted in two U.S. citizens being taken hostage. Urges: (1) the leaders of FARC and ELN, and the leaders of the paramilitary groups, to end the violence, agree to suspend all kidnappings, release all hostages, renounce their relationships with the narcotics trade, and negotiate a meaningful peace accord with the Government of Colombia; and (2) the Colombian Government to rapidly implement a program to help protect threatened human rights workers. Encourages FARC and the Government of Colombia to agree to the establishment of an international observer group that would monitor the \"despeje\" zone and report on illegal narcotics activities and human rights abuses in that zone. Urges FARC to demonstrate its renunciation of the narcotics trade by eradicating coca cultivation in 10,000 hectares of that zone and by cooperating with the Government of Colombia in converting those hectares to the cultivation of legal crops. Welcomes the agreement between FARC and the Government of Colombia to create a commission to investigate and provide a final report on the fate of the three U.S. missionaries. Calls upon the international community to play a more active role in helping to resolve the internal conflict in Colombia by encouraging all sides to participate in the peace process. Declares that the House of Representatives reaffirms U.S. support for the peace process, commits the United States to assist the Government of Colombia in finding a peaceful resolution to the internal conflict, continues to support U.S. assistance to help strengthen political stability and economic growth, and continues to cooperate with all segments of Colombian society who demonstrate a clear and unequivocal commitment to combating the drug trade within Colombia."
