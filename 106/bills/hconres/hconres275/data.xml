  <summary>6/23/2000--Passed House amended.
Declares that Congress: (1) acknowledges that there remain 605 prisoners of war in Iraq; (2) condemns and denounces the Iraqi Government's refusal to comply with international human rights instruments; (3) urges Iraq to disclose the names and whereabouts of those prisoners of war who are still alive; (4) insists that Iraq allow humanitarian organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit living prisoners and to recover the remains of those who have died in captivity; and (5) urges Iraq to immediately release all information regarding the fate of United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Michael Speicher and to release him, or deliver his remains, to the International Committee of the Red Cross for return to the United States.Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. Government should: (1) work with the international community and the Government of Kuwait to secure the release of Kuwaiti and other prisoners of war who are still missing nine years after the end of the Gulf War; (2) exert pressure, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, on Iraq to bring this issue to a close, release all remaining prisoners of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, and rejoin the community of nations with a humane gesture of good will and decency; and (3) actively and urgently work with the international community and the Kuwaiti Government to actively seek information on the status of Lieutenant Commander Speicher and make every effort to expedite his release, or deliver his remains, from Iraq.</summary>
