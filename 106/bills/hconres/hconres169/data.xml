Declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) promote the development in Romania of a market-based economy and a democratic government that respects the rights of all of its citizens; (2) support the territorial integrity of Romania and insist that such integrity be respected by all neighboring countries and by all political movements; and (3) support the integration of Romania into pan- European and trans-Atlantic economic and security institutions.Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should support efforts by Romania to integrate into pan- European and trans-Atlantic institutions and should view such integration as an important factor in consolidating democratic government in Romania; (2) Romania is to be commended for its work to achieve bilateral treaties with the Republic of Hungary and Ukraine; (3) the Government of Romania should work to negotiate a bilateral treaty with the Republic of Moldova that recognizes the borders of those two countries; (4) the Romanian Government should accelerate necessary economic reforms and should address corrupt and criminal activities at all levels; and (5) the United States should undertake to assist Romania to address the costs of disruptions in commerce in southeastern Europe caused by the conflict in Serbia and should join other official creditors of Romania in providing debt relief.</summary>
