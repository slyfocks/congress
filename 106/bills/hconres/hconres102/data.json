Exhorts combatants everywhere to respect the red cross emblem by protecting innocent and vulnerable populations on every side of conflicts. Commends the International Committee of the Red Cross and the more than 175 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, including the American Red Cross: (1) on their continuing work in providing relief and assistance to the victims of war; and (2) for their work in educating the world's citizens about the humanitarian principles of international humanitarian law. Applauds the Promise of Humanity gathering organized by the American Red Cross in 1999 in Washington, D.C., as an important reminder of our responsibilities to educate future generations about the principles of international humanitarian law. Invites the American Red Cross during this anniversary year to assist Congress in educating its members and staff about these Conventions. Supports the anniversary theme of the International Committee that \"Even War Has Limits.\" Calls upon the President to issue a proclamation recognizing such anniversary of these Conventions."
