  <summary>7/29/1999--Introduced.
Declares that it is U.S. policy to: (1) promote the development in the Slovak Republic of a market-based economy and a democratic government that respects the rights of all of its citizens, regardless of ethnic background; and (2) support the eventual integration of the Slovak Republic into pan-European and trans-Atlantic economic and security institutions.Expresses the sense of Congress that the Government of the Slovak Republic formed after the September 1998 elections is to be commended for: (1) its efforts to address the issue of proper treatment of its citizens, regardless of ethnic background; (2) its efforts to improve the economic situation in the Slovak Republic and to accelerate the privatization of state-owned enterprises in a fair and transparent process; (3) its support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO); and (4) its continued support of the NATO effort to ensure stability and democratization across Europe. Calls for such Government to continue to implement programs that may qualify the Slovak Republic for entrance into the European Union and NATO.Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should support efforts for the eventual integration of the Slovak Republic into pan-European and trans-Atlantic institutions, and should view such integration as an important factor in consolidating democratic government and economic stability in the Slovak Republic.</summary>
