Urges that focus be provided on the following three tasks (without regard to sequence) to achieve such a settlement: (1) the termination of bombing by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; (2) the withdrawal of Serbian armed forces from Kosovo; and (3) the cessation of the military activities of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Calls for such tasks to be accomplished through a specified series of confidence-building measures, including: (1) the release of all prisoners of war; (2) the repatriation of all refugees; and (3) an agreement on the composition of the international forces which would administer Kosovo after the Serbian withdrawal."
