  <summary>12/5/2000--Introduced.
All American Voting Rights Resolution - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) Federal, State, and local governments must make every effort to count the votes of members of the uniformed services and their dependents who have submitted ballots legally and in good faith; (2) the Attorney General should fully investigate all allegations of abuses against such voting rights in Florida; and (3) the failure of the Attorney General to take action would violate fundamental principles on which American democracy is founded.</summary>
