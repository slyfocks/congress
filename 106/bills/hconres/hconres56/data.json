Calls on the President to: (1) direct all appropriate officials to raise these concerns with officials from the People's Republic of China; (2) seek from Chinese leaders a public renunciation of any use of (or threat to use) force against Taiwan; and (3) provide an annual report detailing the military balance on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Calls for: (1) the executive branch to inform the appropriate congressional committees when officials from Taiwan seek to purchase defense articles for self-defense; (2) the U.S. Government to encourage a regional high-level dialogue on the best means of ensuring stability, peace, and freedom of the seas in East Asia; and (3) the President to encourage further dialogue between Taiwan and China. Declares that it should be U.S. policy to publicly support Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization as soon as possible and to encourage others to adopt similar policies."
