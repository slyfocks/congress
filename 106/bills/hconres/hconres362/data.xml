  <summary>6/22/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development, should work with foreign law enforcement and judicial agencies to enact legal system reforms to more effectively address the investigation and prosecution of so- called honor crimes, and make resources available to local organizations to provide refuge and rehabilitation for women who are victims of such crimes and their children; and (2) the Department of State, when preparing yearly Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, should include information relating to the incidence of honor violence in foreign countries, the steps taken to address such problem, and all relevant actions taken by the United States to reduce the incidence of such violence and to increase investigations and prosecutions of such crimes.Calls for: (1) the United States to communicate to the United Nations (UN) the concern over the high rate of honor-related violence toward women worldwide and request that the appropriate UN bodies propose actions to be taken to encourage these countries to end such violence; and (2) the President and the Secretary of State to communicate directly with leaders of countries where honor killings, dowry deaths, and related practices are endemic in order to convey the serious concerns over these gross violations of human rights and urge these leaders to investigate and prosecute all such acts as murder, with the appropriate penalties.</summary>
