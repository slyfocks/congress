  <summary>10/23/2000--Introduced.
Declares that: (1) the period preceding the elections held in Belarus on October 15, 2000, was plagued by human rights abuses and a climate of fear for which the regime of Aleksandr Lukashenko is responsible; (2) such elections were conducted in the absence of a democratic electoral law; (3) the Lukashenko regime purposely denied the democratic opposition access to state-controlled media; and (4) such elections were for seats in a parliament that has been deprived of its real constitutional power and democratic legitimacy by the Lukashenko regime.Declares the support of Congress for the Belarus' democratic opposition, and commends the efforts of the opposition to boycott the illegitimate parliamentary elections. Reaffirms recognition of the 13th Supreme Soviet as the only democratically and constitutionally legitimate legislative body of Belarus.Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should call upon Lukashenko and his regime to: (1) provide a full accounting of the disappearances of specified individuals in Belarus; and (2) release specified individuals imprisoned in Belarus for their political views.</summary>
