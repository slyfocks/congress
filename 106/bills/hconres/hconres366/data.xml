  <summary>6/29/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the historical illiteracy of U.S. college and university graduates is a serious problem that should be addressed by the higher education community; (2) boards of trustees and administrators at institutions of higher education in the United States should review their curricula and add requirements in U.S. history; (3) State officials responsible for higher education should review public college and university curricula and promote requirements in U.S. history; (4) parents should encourage their children to select institutions of higher education with substantial history requirements and students should take courses in U.S. history, whether required or not; and (5) history teachers and educators at all levels should redouble their efforts to bolster the knowledge of U.S. history among students of all ages and to restore the vitality of U.S. civic memory.</summary>
