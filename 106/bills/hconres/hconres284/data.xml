  <summary>3/15/2000--Introduced.
Expresses that it is the sense of Congress that: (1) members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should immediately increase crude oil production; (2) nations that act to restrict the supply of crude oil do serious damage to their relations with the United States; (3) continued diplomatic efforts by the United States are necessary to convince all major crude oil exporting countries that current price levels are unsustainable and will cause widespread economic harm; (4) the United States will note actions by these countries to restrict or expand the production of crude oil when considering possible non-humanitarian assistance or trade benefits; (5) the President should review administrative policies that may put an undue burden on domestic crude oil producers and should consider rescinding unnecessary regulations that interfere with the ability of the U.S. energy industry to meet a greater percentage of U.S. energy needs; and (6) Congress and the President should work together to develop policies that will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources.</summary>
