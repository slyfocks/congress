Peacekeeping Operations in Kosovo Resolution - Authorizes the President to deploy U.S. armed forces personnel to Kosovo as part of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) peacekeeping operation implementing a Kosovo peace agreement, subject to the following limitations. Urges the President, before ordering such deployment, to submit to the Congress: (1) personally and in writing, a detailed statement explaining the national interest at risk in the Kosovo conflict and a certification that all U.S. armed forces personnel deployed will be under the operational control of only U.S. armed forces military officers; and (2) specified detailed reports on the nature of U.S. military resources required, the military exit strategy, the chain of command for deployed U.S. personnel, the percentage of U.S. forces participating in any NATO peacekeeping operation, the impact of such deployment on military readiness, a time frame for withdrawal of U.S. personnel, the rules of engagement, the budgetary impact, the threats attendant to such deployment and the nature and level of force protection required, intelligence sharing arrangements and the effects of Russian participation, the scope of the mission of U.S. personnel, verification of compliance with any Kosovo peace agreement, and the terms and conditions of any peace agreement. Makes the authorization under this Act subject to the limitation that the number of U.S. armed forces personnel participating in the deployment not exceed 15 percent of the total NATO force deployed to Kosovo in the peacekeeping operation, unless the President determines and notifies the Congress that U.S. forces or U.S. citizens are in danger.</summary>
