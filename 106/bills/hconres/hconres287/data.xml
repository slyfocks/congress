  <summary>3/16/2000--Introduced.
Calls on the President to direct the Secretary of Energy to: (1) take immediate action to negotiate with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and with non-OPEC nations to increase oil production sufficient to mitigate the current supply crisis such that world oil prices reach a sustainable level for both producer and consumer nations; and (2) develop a plan and recommend to Congress by July 1, 2000, both short-term and long-term solutions by which the United States can reduce its dependence on foreign oil.</summary>
