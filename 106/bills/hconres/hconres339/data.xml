  <summary>5/25/2000--Introduced.
Declares that Congress: (1) reaffirms its particular right and obligation to express its opposition to anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies in countries with important relationships with the United States; (2) condemns the May 11 Media/Most raid by the Russian Federal Security Service as a breach of normal legal procedure and a deliberate political attack on independent media; (3) expresses profound regret and dismay at the detention and continued prosecution of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Andrey Babitsky and other manifestations of official policy directed against the independent media; (4) urges Members to use any meetings with ministers and political leaders of the Russian Federation to express concern for the continued functioning of independent media in Russia; and (5) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, and other U.S. officials and agencies to emphasize to Russian officials U.S. concern that official pressures against such media are incompatible with democratic norms.</summary>
