  <summary>4/13/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the United States should continue to actively pursue a full accounting of all members of the armed forces (and others) who remain unaccounted for from past conflicts (particularly the Korean and Vietnam Wars); (2) as part of such efforts, the Secretary of Defense should continue at current levels activities to account for persons who are unaccounted for from such conflicts and who were at any time classified as a prisoner of war or missing in action or who were determined to have been killed in action although the body was not recovered, and the United States should continue to declassify Department of Defense documents and to release intelligence information held by agencies of the Government that relates to cases of such persons; and (3) the United States should continue to take steps necessary for pursuing, in the case of any future military conflict, a full accounting of all personnel who are classified at any time as a prisoner of war or missing in action.</summary>
