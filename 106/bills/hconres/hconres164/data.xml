Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) adhere to the "Weinberger Doctrine" (i.e., the philosophy of former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger which set forth specified objectives) with respect to the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances; and (2) after the mission of the armed forces has been defined and after the armed forces have been introduced, allow senior general officers of the armed forces to carry out the mission in an unhindered manner.</summary>
