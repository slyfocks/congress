    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Levels and Amounts Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking Title III: Sense of Congress, House, and Senate Provisions Subtitle A: Sense of Congress Provisions Subtitle B: Sense of the House Provisions Subtitle C: Sense of the Senate Provisions Sets forth the congressional budget for the Government for FY 2000, including the appropriate budgetary levels for FY 2001 through 2009. Title I: Levels and Amounts - Lists recommended budgetary levels and amounts, for FY 2000 through 2009, with respect to: (1) Federal revenues; (2) new budget authority; (3) budget outlays; (4) deficits or surpluses; and (5) public debt. (Sec. 102) Sets forth for such fiscal years specified amounts of revenues and outlays of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 103) Lists the appropriate levels of new budget authority and outlays for specified major functional categories for FY 2000 through 2009. (Sec. 104) Directs the Finance Committee to report to the Senate, and the Ways and Means Committee to report to the House of Representatives, a reconciliation bill proposing necessary changes to reduce revenues by specified amounts for FY 2000 through 2009. Title II: Budgetary Restraints and Rulemaking - Makes it out of order in the House or the Senate to consider any revision to this or the FY 2001 concurrent budget resolution (or an amendment or conference report) that sets forth a deficit for any fiscal year. Makes such point of order inapplicable if the deficit results solely from legislation to enhance retirement security through structural programmatic reform. Excludes from any deficit level any adjustments in aggregates made pursuant to any reserve fund that provides for adjustments in allocations and aggregates for such legislation. (Sec. 202) Provides that whenever the Ways and Means Committee or the Finance Committee reports a measure (or offers an amendment or submits a conference report) that enhances retirement security through structural programmatic reform, the appropriate Budget Committee chairman may: (1) increase appropriate allocations and aggregates of new budget authority and outlays by the amount of such authority provided by the measure; (2) in the Senate, adjust levels used for determining compliance with the pay-as-you-go requirements of this resolution; and (3) reduce the revenue aggregates by the amount of the revenue loss resulting from the measure. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the appropriate Budget Committee chairman, when legislation is reported that implements structural Medicare reform and extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund, to change committee allocations and spending aggregates if such legislation will not cause an on-budget deficit for FY 2000 through 2009. Permits an adjustment to be made to address the cost of the prescription drug benefit. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the appropriate Budget Committee chairman, whenever the House Committee on Agriculture or the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry reports a bill that provides risk management or income assistance for agriculture producers, to increase the allocation of budget authority and outlays to that committee by the amount of budget authority provided by such legislation, provided such legislation does not cause certain net increases in budget authority or outlays and subject to specified limitations in budget authority and outlays. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Senate Budget Committee chairman to reduce spending and revenue aggregates and revise committee allocations for legislation that reduces revenues if such legislation will not increase the deficit or decrease the surplus for periods through FY 2009. (Sec. 206) Provides that the criteria to be considered in determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is an emergency requirement in legislation are whether it is: (1) necessary, essential, or vital; (2) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (3) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (4) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (5) not permanent, temporary in nature. Requires a committee report or the statement of managers to justify why a requirement should be accorded emergency status if it does not meet such criteria. Strikes emergency requirements in legislation under consideration in the Senate when a point of order is sustained against such requirements. Makes this requirement inapplicable with respect to emergency designations for provisions making discretionary appropriations in the defense category. Waives this section in the Senate with a three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section. Terminates this section on the adoption of the FY 2001 concurrent budget resolution. (Sec. 207) Provides a point of order in the Senate against the consideration of direct spending or revenue legislation that would increase, or cause, an on-budget deficit during specified time periods. Waives this section with a three-fifths majority vote. Requires the same majority vote to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section. Terminates this section on the last day of FY 2002. (Sec. 208) Provides for the application and effect of changes in allocations and aggregates made pursuant to this resolution. (Sec. 209) Considers the levels submitted pursuant to H. Res. 5 (106th Congress) or S. Res. 312 (105th Congress) to be those for the FY 1999 concurrent budget resolution. (Sec. 210) Allows Senate revenue and spending aggregates and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits to be adjusted and allocations revised for legislation that finances disability programs designed to allow individuals with disabilities to become employed and remain independent, provided that this budget resolution does not include the costs of such legislation and such legislation will not increase the deficits or decrease the surplus for FY 2000 through 2009. Authorizes the Budget Committee chairman to file revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates in such event, and for any amendments to such legislation. (Sec. 211) Requires the Congressional Budget Office to update its economic and budget forecast for FY 2000 by July 1, 1999. Authorizes the appropriate Budget Committee chairman, if such report estimates an on-budget surplus for FY 2000, to make the following adjustments in an amount equal to such surplus: (1) reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate; (2) increase the on-budget surplus levels used for determining compliance with pay-as-you-go requirements of this resolution; and (3) adjust the instruction in sections 104 and 105 to reduce revenues for FY 2000 and increase the reduction in revenues for FY 2000 through 2009. (Sec. 212) Authorizes the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, upon the reporting of a bill, the offering of an amendment, or submission of a conference report thereon that allows local educational agencies to use appropriated funds to carry out activities under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to increase the outlay aggregate and allocation for FY 2000 by a limited amount and adjust the levels used for determining compliance with pay-as-you-go requirements of this resolution. Conditions such authority on the legislation not causing a net increase in budget authority or outlays for FY 2000 through 2009. Title III: Sense of Congress, House, and Senate Provisions - Subtitle A: Sense of Congress Provisions - Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to: (1) the use of social security surpluses for payment of benefits, retirement security, social security reform, or reduction of debt held by the public; (2) the use within the classrooms of funds appropriated for elementary and secondary education programs; (3) modification of the Federal tax law to encourage asset-building of the working poor; (4) improvements to nutrition programs, particularly with regard to low-income children; and (5) full funding for part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Act before making appropriations for new education programs. Subtitle B: Sense of the House Provisions - Expresses the sense of the House with respect to: (1) funding for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom; and (2) a report from the Secretary of Labor assessing the Welfare-to-Work Program. Subtitle C: Sense of the Senate Provisions - Expresses the sense of the Senate with respect to: (1) opposition to investing contributions in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Trust Funds in private financial markets; (2) the solvency of Medicare; (3) education; (4) tax relief and reform; (5) choices, access, and services under the Medicare+Choice program; (6) funding for law enforcement; (7) improving security for U.S. diplomatic missions and additional budgetary resources for international affairs funding; (8) budgetary increases for biomedical research and additional resources for autism research; (9) objection to Kyoto Protocol funding prior to Senate ratification; (10) distribution of excess Federal gasoline tax revenues to the States; (11) reauthorization of funds for the Farmland Protection Program; (12) social security reform and the disabled; (13) reporting an itemization of on-budget trust fund levels; (14) South Korea's international trade practices on pork and beef; and (15) congressional procedures for funding emergencies, including natural disasters."
