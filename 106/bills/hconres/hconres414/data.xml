  <summary>10/24/2000--Passed House amended.
Declares that the United States supports: (1) democratic efforts that respect the human and political rights of all ethnic and religious groups in Afghanistan, including the effort to establish a "Loya Jirgah"(Grand Assembly) process that would lead to the Afghan people determining their own destiny; and (2) the continuing efforts of former King Mohammed Zahir Shah and other parties to convene a Loya Jirgah to reestablish a representative government that respects the rights of all ethnic groups, to bring freedom, peace, and stability, and to end terrorist activities, illicit drug production, and human rights abuses in Afghanistan.</summary>
