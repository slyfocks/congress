  <summary>11/17/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should negotiate a new base rights agreement with the Government of Panama to: (1) permit stationing of U.S. armed forces in Panama beyond December 31, 1999; and (2) ensure that the Panama Canal remains open, secure, and neutral, consistent with the Panama Canal Treaty, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, and the resolutions of ratification.Calls for the President to: (1) ensure that U.S. military facilities which could be utilized for stationing of U.S. armed forces shall be fully maintained and secured if the Government of Panama is willing to enter into good faith negotiations for a continued U.S. military presence; and (2) consult with Congress throughout the base rights negotiations.</summary>
