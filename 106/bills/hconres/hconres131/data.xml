  <summary>6/10/1999--Introduced.
Condemns: (1) Palestinian efforts to circumvent United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as violate the Oslo peace process, by attempting to revive UN General Assembly Resolution 181 and thereby placing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at risk; and (2) the UN Commission on Human Rights for voting to formally endorse such Resolution as the basis for the future of Palestinian self-determination. Reiterates: (1) that any just and final peace agreement regarding the final status of the territory controlled by the Palestinians can only be determined through direct negotiations and agreement between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization; and (2) Congress' continued unequivocal support for the security and well-being of the State of Israel and of the Oslo peace process based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Calls for the President to declare that: (1) it is U.S. policy that UN General Assembly Resolution 181 is null and void; (2) all negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; and (3) the United States regards any attempt by the Palestinians, the UN, or any entity to resurrect UN General Assembly Resolution 181 as a basis for negotiations, or for any international decision, as an attempt to sabotage the prospects for a successful peace agreement in the Middle East.</summary>
