  <summary>7/1/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) senior citizens should not be forced to pay a large part of their monthly income for prescription drugs; (2) a top priority for the available budget surplus should be to strengthen and modernize the Medicare program (title XVIII of the Social Security Act) for the future, including adding prescription drug coverage; (3) President Clinton should be commended for introducing a Medicare reform proposal with a prescription drug benefit; and (4) Congress should consider legislation to accomplish this as soon as possible.</summary>
