  <summary>3/2/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a National Teach Census Week should be established to recognize the importance of participating in the 2000 decennial census; and (2) the President should issue a proclamation calling on elementary, secondary, and high school teachers across the Nation, particularly those involved in teaching American history and government, to instruct their students on the importance of participating in such census.</summary>
