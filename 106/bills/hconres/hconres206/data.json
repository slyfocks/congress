Urges such Government to seek and accept international humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the internally displaced persons from Chechnya, so as to reduce the risk of civilian casualties.Urges the Chechen authorities to use every appropriate means to deny extremist forces located in its territory a base of operations for the mounting of armed incursions that threaten peace and stability in the North Caucasus region and to create a rule of law environment with legal norms based upon internationally accepted standards.Calls on the United States Government to express to all parties the necessity of resolving the conflict peacefully, with full respect to the human rights of all the citizens of the Russian Federation, and to support the provision of appropriate international humanitarian assistance.Cautions that forcible resettlement of internationally displaced persons would evoke outrage from the international community."
