  <summary>11/10/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) November 11, 1999, will be the final time this century on which the Nation will give special recognition to the contributions of its veterans in defending freedom and democracy; (2) the Nation should use that occasion to make a greater effort to educate children on the contributions of veterans; and (3) it is the hope of Congress that the new millennium will bring a diminished need to sacrifice the lives of young Americans in the cause of securing and preserving freedom.</summary>
