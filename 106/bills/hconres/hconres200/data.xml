  <summary>10/19/1999--Introduced.
Condemns: (1) the overthrow of the democratically-elected Government of Pakistan by the armed forces of Pakistan on October 12, 1999, in violation of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; and (2) the subsequent declaration by General Musharraf of a state of emergency, the suspension of Pakistan's Constitution, the dismissal of the national government and the legislature, and the declaration of himself as Pakistan's supreme leader.Expresses grave concern about the implications for security and stability in the South Asia region in light of the history of tensions between India and Pakistan and the fact that both nations have recently tested nuclear devices. Urges both countries to exercise restraint.Calls for the immediate restoration of a civilian, democratically-elected government in Pakistan and the restoration of democracy and the rule of law.Urges the armed forces of Pakistan to respect the human rights of all Pakistani citizens, including those members of the national government who are currently being illegally detained in violation of their constitutional and human rights.Calls on the President not to consider exercising the waiver authority which would be granted to him by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000 (presented by Congress on October 14, 1999, for the President's approval), to allow the sale of any military equipment or services to Pakistan, or reinstatement of Pakistan's eligibility for international military education and training, until a civilian, democratically-elected government is returned to power.</summary>
