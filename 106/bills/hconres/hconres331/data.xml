  <summary>5/22/2000--Introduced.
Commends Israel for its decision to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon and for taking risks for peace in the Middle East.Calls upon the United Nations Security Council to: (1) recognize Israel's fulfillment of its obligations under Security Council Resolution 425 and to provide the necessary resources for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to implement its mandate under that resolution; and (2) insist upon the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory.Urges UNIFIL, in cooperation with the Lebanese armed forces, to gain full control over southern Lebanon, including by taking actions to ensure the disarmament of Hezbollah and all other such groups to eliminate all terrorist activity originating from that area.Appeals to the Government of Lebanon to grant clemency and assure the safety and rehabilitation into Lebanese society of all members of the South Lebanon Army and their families.Calls upon the international community to ensure that southern Lebanon does not once again become a staging ground for attacks against Israel and to cooperate in bringing about the reconstruction and reintegration of southern Lebanon.Recognizes Israel's right to defend itself and its people from attack and reasserts U.S. support for maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge to ensure Israel's long-term security.Urges all parties to reenter the peace process with the Government of Israel to bring peace and stability to all the Middle East.</summary>
