  <summary>4/15/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that Federal departments and agencies should: (1) coordinate Federal decisions and actions that affect water and ensure that each such decision or action promotes the use of water in a sustainable manner; (2) promote processes for developing comprehensive watershed plans that include all appropriate local and regional governments within watersheds and that consider the implications of land use on water; (3) consider the impact on entire watersheds when making a Federal decision or taking a Federal action that affects water; (4) promote the involvement of citizen and environmental groups and the business community in watershed planning processes and provide for such involvement when making such a decision or taking such an action that affects water; and (5) establish clear standards for compliance with Federal regulations affecting bodies of water or water supplies and provide flexibility for such compliance, using market forces whenever possible.</summary>
