  <summary>10/28/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) phonemic awareness followed by direct systematic phonics instruction should be used in all schools as a first, and essential, step in teaching a student to read; and (2) phonics instruction should be an integral part of pre-service teaching requirements so that teachers will have the skills to effectively teach reading.</summary>
