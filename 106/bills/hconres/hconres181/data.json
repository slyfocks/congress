Pickett, Private First Class Earnest Dawson, Jr., and Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Scott; and (2) deepest sympathy to the families of David H. Pickett and Earnest Dawson, Jr., for their tragic and wrongful deaths; (3) profound regret that the available remedies have failed to bring Ferman Hernandez and Serveriano Fuentes, the men responsible for executing Pickett and Dawson, to justice.Declares that: (1) the United States should improve the legal protections for its military personnel who serve in foreign lands and their families; and (2) the Government of El Salvador should amend its Constitution to permit the extradition of Hernandez and Fuentes to the United States for trial.Urges the President to: (1) continue efforts to obtain the extradition of Hernandez and Fuentes; (2) initiate changes to the Geneva Convention and other international agreements that would prevent amnesty from being used to deny redress for grave breaches of the Geneva Convention; (3) initiate other changes to the Geneva Convention and other relevant international agreements to ensure and improve the legal protections for U.S. military personnel serving in foreign lands and their families; (4) examine all status-of-forces agreements and similar agreements and obtain revisions to ensure that the legal protections for U.S. military personnel will not suffer another failure; (5) encourage other countries to enact laws substantially similar to the War Crimes Act of 1996; and (6) report to the Congress at least annually regarding the actions taken and the progress made."
