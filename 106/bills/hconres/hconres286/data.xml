  <summary>3/16/2000--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should ensure the safety and well being of the U.S. citizen and Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia nun, Sister Maria, in the Jericho Gardens Monastery in Jericho; (2) the United States should express to the Palestine Authority its concerns that property disputes in Jericho and Hebron are being settled arbitrarily by military fiat rather than in courts of law; (3) the dispute over seizure of the Church by the Palestinian Authority must be resolved in accordance with the rule of law; (4) the Palestinian Authority must ensure the rights of Sister Maria and the Church so that the dispute can be resolved in a fair manner; (5) the Monastery, as well as the other Church property in Jericho and Hebron, should be returned to the conditions that existed before the illegal seizures, pending a resolution of this dispute in a court of law following international standards of due process; and (6) the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem is to be commended for its immediate response and ongoing support for the two U.S. citizen nuns in Jericho.</summary>
