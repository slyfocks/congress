Expresses the sense of Congress that the Government of Bulgaria: (1) is to be commended for its efforts to ensure proper treatment of all of its citizens, for its efforts to accelerate the privatization of state-owned enterprises in a fair and transparent process, for its establishment of a currency board, and for its efforts to combat corrupt and criminal activities; (2) should continue to implement programs that may qualify Bulgaria for entrance into the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and is to be commended for its continuing support of the NATO effort to ensure stability and democratization across Europe; (3) should ensure the ratification of all bilateral treaties that have been negotiated with the Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;(4) should halt any illicit transfer of arms and military equipment that may occur in Bulgaria or may cross Bulgarian territory; and (5) should play a central role in any NATO effort to create a joint peacekeeping military unit involving personnel from throughout the countries of southeastern Europe or in the creation of facilities in support of such a unit. Calls for the United States to join other official creditors of Bulgaria in providing Bulgaria with debt relief."
