  <summary>7/1/1999--Introduced.
Declares that Congress: (1) calls upon the Office of National Drug Control Policy to report to Congress on the progress made by the Government of Mexico in undertaking specified measures to fight drug trafficking; (2) considers these matters to be of paramount importance to the bilateral relationship between the United States and the United Mexican States; (3) calls upon the Government of Mexico to immediately return excess Huey helicopters to the U.S. Government if it no longer wants custody of this drug fighting equipment so that they might be used by other countries; (4) will consider these matters at the beginning of the second session of the 106th Congress and review whether the Government of Mexico has made substantial progress in these matters; (5) calls upon the Office of National Drug Control Policy to submit to Congress a plan to promptly redistribute the returned Huey helicopters to other drug fighting countries cooperating with the United States on counternarcotics efforts; and (6) calls upon the U.S. Government to intensify efforts to secure a maritime agreement with the Government of Mexico to facilitate greater counternarcotics cooperation.</summary>
