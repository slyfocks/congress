  <summary>3/16/1999--Introduced.
Constitutional Amendment - States that the moneys of the United States held for purposes of the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance program (title II of the Social Security Act (SSA)) and the Hospital Insurance program (SSA title XVIII (Medicare) part A) shall be held in separate and independent trust funds and shall be segregated from all other moneys of the United States. Prohibits the receipts and disbursements of such programs, including program revenues, from being included in either the President's or Congress' budget. States that Congress may make no law authorizing the use of such trust funds (social security as well as hospital insurance trust funds) for any purpose other than for providing for the prompt and effective payment of benefits, administrative expenses, and such amounts as may be necessary and appropriate to correct prior incorrect payments. Bars any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or any officer or employee thereof, from using or authorizing the use of such trust funds for any purpose other than as congressionally authorized in accordance with this constitutional amendment.</summary>
