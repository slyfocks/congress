Social Security Guarantee Initiative - Calls for the President and Congress to join in strengthening the social security program and protecting the retirement income security of all Americans for the 21st century in a manner that: (1) ensures equal treatment across generations to all Americans, especially minorities and other low- income workers; (2) recognizes the unique obstacles that women face in ensuring retirement, disability, and survivor security and the essential role that such program plays in protecting women's financial stability; (3) provides a continuous benefit safety net for workers, survivors, their dependents, and the disabled; (4) protects guaranteed lifetime benefits, including cost-of-living adjustments that fully index for inflation, for current and future retirees; and (5) does not increase taxes.</summary>
