  <summary>8/5/1999--Introduced.
Improved Patient Access to Clinical Studies Act of 1999 - Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to prohibit a group health plan and, except under IRC, a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage from denying, limiting, or imposing additional conditions on coverage if: (1) the participant or beneficiary is participating in an approved clinical study; (2) the items and services are furnished according to the study's design or to treat conditions resulting from study participation; and (3) the items and services would otherwise be covered. Prohibits discrimination against a participant or beneficiary on the basis of the participant's or beneficiary's study participation. Amends PHSA to generally apply that prohibition to coverage offered by an issuer in the individual market.</summary>
