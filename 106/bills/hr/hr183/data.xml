  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, to direct the Attorney General to waive the requirement that an alien seeking to pursue a course of study in a public secondary school reimburse the school's local educational agency (LEA), if the LEA certifies to the Attorney General that such waiver will promote the LEA's educational interest and will not impose on it an undue financial burden.</summary>
