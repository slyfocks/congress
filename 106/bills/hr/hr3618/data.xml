  <summary>2/10/2000--Introduced.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Improvement Act of 1999 - Amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to permit continuation of collection activities and communications during the 30-day period following notice of debt unless the consumer requests cessation of such activities.Broadens prescriptions governing debtor's civil liability to include a series of class actions arising out of the same violations by the same debt collector.Disallows recovery of legal fees that accrue after the date of a consumer's refusal of a debt collector's settlement offer which is greater than or equal to the final judgment award (including participants in a class action or series of class actions).Requires the court to consider the amount of actual damages awarded when it determines the amount of liability.Shields a debt collector from liability if the preponderance of the evidence shows that the violation resulted from good faith compliance with either Federal or State rules of civil procedure, or with a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding.</summary>
