  <summary>10/18/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the issuance of a permit for hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal for any hazardous waste facility to be located in a flood plain if such facility is a major facility (as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)).Directs the EPA Administrator to study and report to Congress on the 100-year flood criteria contained in regulations under such Act regarding the location of such facilities. Requires the study to investigate whether such criteria are adequate to protect human health and the environment from the release of hazardous waste due to flooding at such facilities.Requires certain standards for hazardous waste generators with respect to labeling practices for hazardous waste containers to insure that information labels will remain in place and be visible during transportation and storage in the event of flood or other natural disaster.Amends the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 to require location information on certain emergency and hazardous chemical inventory forms to include a statement of whether or not the hazardous chemicals are located in a flood plain area.</summary>
