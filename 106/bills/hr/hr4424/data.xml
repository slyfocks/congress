  <summary>5/11/2000--Introduced.
Volunteer Organization Safety Act of 2000 - Prohibits the Government from requiring a State requesting a criminal history check on a volunteer worker to supply the worker's fingerprints until the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines that: (1) automated fingerprint checks are universally available for volunteer organizations in that State; and (2) a reasonable reduction has occurred in the cost of the check and the length of time required to complete it.(Sec. 3) Expresses the sense of Congress that, to be effective, a background check must be fast, accurate, cost-effective, and performed on everyone having regular contact with young people in a youth service organization.</summary>
