Requires the head of an agency, within 30 days after the completion of the public comment period, to transmit to the Congress: (1) each peer review report; (2) all scientific data used in support of the proposed regulation or requested by a peer reviewer; (3) the response of the head of the agency to points of disagreement among the peer reviewers; and (4) all public comments received. Prohibits the proposed regulation from being issued in final form until 30 days after transmittal. Requires publication of a final peer reviewed regulation to include a summary of such reports, points of disagreement, and responses. Requires regulations issued establishing peer review procedures to include emergency exception provisions."
