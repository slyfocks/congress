Pediatric Organ Transplantation Improvement Act of 2000 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to: (1) recognize the differences in health and organ transplantation issues between children (individuals under the age of 18) and adults and adopt criteria, policies, and procedures that address children's unique health care needs; and (2) carry out studies and demonstration projects to improve procedures for organ donation procurement and allocation.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study and report to Congress on the costs of immunosuppressive drugs provided to children pursuant to organ transplants and the extent to which health plans and health insurance cover such costs, including recommendations on issues particular to the special health and transplantation needs of children.</summary>
