  <summary>4/29/1999--Introduced.
Congressional Campaign and Administrative Reform Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to prohibit contributions by multicandidate political committees to House of Representative candidates. (Sec. 3) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a tax credit of up to $50 ($100 on a joint return) for all contributions. (Sec. 4) Allows aggregate deductions of up to $250 ($500 on a joint return) for contributions to House of Representative campaigns. (Sec. 5) Adds a new title to FECA, Title V: Voluntary Expenditure Limitations and Free Broadcast Time for House of Representatives General Elections. Establishes the requirements (concerning contributions, expenditures, and records) a House of Representatives candidate must fulfill in order to receive free broadcast time under provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 (added by this Act) which require each licensee for a broadcasting station to make available certain free broadcast time to qualified candidates for political advertising. (Sec. 7) Amends FECA to require any payment by the national committee of a political party or a State committee of a political party for a mixed political activity to be :(1) subject to limitation and reporting under the Act as if such payment were an expenditure; and (2) paid only from an account that is subject to the requirements of the Act. Repeals the building fund exception to the definition of the term "contribution." (Sec. 8) Requires at least 80 percent of the contributions accepted by a House of Representatives candidate to be from in-State individual residents. (Sec. 9) Makes the $20,000 limit on contributions to national political party committees applicable to contributions to State political party committees. (Sec. 10) Requires the reporting of election-related payments by corporations, labor organizations, and non-profit organizations. (Sec. 11) Prohibits any nonparty multicandidate political committee or person required to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 from acting as an intermediary or conduit with respect to a contribution to a candidate for Federal office. (Sec. 12) Sets forth severability provisions.</summary>
