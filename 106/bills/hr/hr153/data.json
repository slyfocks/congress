Permits the Secretary, after the enactment of this Act, to only acquire lands or interests for administration by the Bureau by exchange, donation, or from amounts made available from the Fund. Specifies that there shall be deposited in the Fund: (1) all amounts received by the Secretary from the disposal of any lands or interests administered by the Bureau; and (2) all amounts received by the United States by gift for acquisition of lands to be administered by the Bureau. Declares the annual budget requests submitted by the Secretary shall be accompanied by information as to whether the Bureau, through preparation of land use plans, has identified public lands which are suitable for transfer to other management or for disposal, the transfer or disposal of which has been delayed because of incomplete surveys or other reasons."
