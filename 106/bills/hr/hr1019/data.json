    "text": "Carlsbad Irrigation Project Acquired Land Conveyance Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to convey to the Carlsbad Irrigation District specified lands and interests within the Carlsbad Project in New Mexico in consideration of the District accepting the Federal Government obligations for the project, and subject to the completion of payments by the District required under this Act. Directs the Secretary to complete such conveyance expeditiously, if no changes in Project operations are expected following such conveyance, but within 180 days after the enactment of this Act. Requires the Secretary, if the District intends to change Project operations as a result of the conveyance, to: (1) take into account those potential changes for the purpose of completing any required environmental evaluation associated with the conveyance; and (2) complete the conveyance within two years after enactment. Provides for: (1) the full cost of administrative action and environmental compliance for the conveyance to be borne by the Secretary if he or she fails to complete the conveyance before the applicable deadline; and (2) one-half of such cost to be paid by the District if the Secretary completes the conveyance before that deadline. Directs the Secretary to: (1) provide a written identification of all mineral and grazing leases in effect on such lands; and (2) notify all such leaseholders of the conveyance made by this Act. Requires receipts from leases, licenses, and permits accruing after the conveyance date to be used for Project purposes and for financing the portion of operations, maintenance, and replacement at the Summer Dam that, prior to conveyance, was the responsibility of the Bureau of Reclamation, with the exception of major maintenance programs in progress prior to the conveyance. Requires amounts paid into the reclamation fund as construction credits to the Project to be credited to deficit reduction or retirement of the Federal debt. Makes the District ineligible for any emergency loan from the Bureau for maintenance or replacement of any facility conveyed after the completion of such conveyance."
