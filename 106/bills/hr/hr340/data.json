Allows a limited tax credit to taxpayers holding such public school modernization bonds. Raises the national zone academy bond limitation from $400 million to $1.4 billion for 2000 and 2001, and eliminates the limitation after 2002. Prescribes requirements for national qualified school construction bonds, with a national limitation of $13.7 billion for 2000 and 2001, and no limit after 2001."
