Directs the President: (1) to initiate preliminary consultations with the government of each eligible Pacific Rim country within 60 days after enactment of this Act; (2) if such consultations indicate that establishment of a free trade area between the United States and the country is feasible and desirable, to request a meeting at the ministerial level to consider the conditions for formal negotiations; and (3) to recommend establishment of a council of public and private sector officials from the respective countries to analyze and report on the existing bilateral relationship and the prospects for a successful negotiation. Directs the President to report to specified congressional committees on the feasibility of commencing formal negotiations regarding a free trade agreement with a Pacific Rim country."
