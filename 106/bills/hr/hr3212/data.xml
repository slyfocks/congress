  <summary>11/3/1999--Introduced.
International Extradition Enforcement Act of 1999 - Directs the Secretary of State to report annually to Congress on efforts between the United States and a government of a foreign country to extradite to the United States an individual being held in custody by such government and whom the United States: (1) has charged with a major extraditable offense; (2) has found guilty of committing a major extraditable offense; or (3) is seeking to extradite to complete a judicially pronounced penalty of deprivation of liberty for a major extraditable offense. Defines "major extraditable offense" as murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, kidnaping, abduction, or other false imprisonment, or rape.Prohibits the provision of development and security assistance to, or the issuance of a visa to any alien who is a high-ranking official of, a government of a country uncooperative in extradition efforts with the United States. Provides for the waiver of such prohibitions if it is in the vital national interests of the United States.Directs the Attorney General to establish procedures under which a State, which is requesting extradition of one or more individuals from a foreign country failing to comply with such request, may file a formal complaint with the Attorney General for purposes of determining whether or not such country has failed to extradite to the United States during the preceding two- year period five or more individuals (involving unrelated extradition requests) in accordance with this Act.Amends Federal criminal law to increase the criminal penalty for individuals who flee to avoid prosecution or give testimony in the United States. Imposes both civil and criminal penalties for persons who knowingly transfer from the United States anything of value to a person in a foreign country with the intent to assist such person in resisting extradition to the United States.</summary>
