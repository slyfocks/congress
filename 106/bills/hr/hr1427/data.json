Declares that such committees shall not constitute labor organizations for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a special advisory committee, with expertise in workplace safety and health, to advise on the establishment and implementation of a third party consultation services program.(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to establish a third party consultation services program that certifies individuals to provide consultation services to help employers identify and correct safety and health hazards in the workplace. Provides for: (1) a registry of certified consultants; (2) disciplinary actions against consultants for malfeasance; (3) scope and guidelines for such consultative services; and (4) access to records. Exempts any employer receiving a declaration of OSHA compliance from a certified consultant from assessment of certain civil penalties for two years after receipt of such declaration, except in specified circumstances.(Sec. 6) Requires certain Federal personnel responsible for enforcing OSHA to: (1) meet specified eligibility requirements; and (2) receive professional education and training at least every five years if they carry out inspections or investigations.(Sec. 7) Revises inspection methods. Authorizes the Secretary's representative to contact an employer by telephone, facsimile, or other appropriate methods to determine whether: (1) the employer has taken corrective actions with respect to the alleged violation or danger; or (2) there are reasonable grounds to believe that a hazard exists. Provides that certain inspections are not required to be conducted if the Secretary determines that an inspection request was made for reasons other than employee safety and health or that the employees are not at risk.(Sec. 8) Establishes the use of alternative safe methods as an affirmative defense for employers.(Sec. 9) Reduces the types of violations of posting or paperwork requirements for which an employer may be assessed a civil penalty.(Sec. 10) Revises factors which the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission is required to consider in assessing civil penalties.(Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with States for State consultation services to employers concerning the provision of safe and healthful working conditions.Directs the Secretary to carry out a two-year pilot program in three States to provide small businesses, upon request, for a nominal fee, with expedited consultation services on safe and healthful working conditions. Requires the Secretary, before issuing a citation to an employer for a violation found during a consultation, to permit the employer to carry out corrective measures.(Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) cooperative agreements to encourage the establishment of comprehensive safety and health management systems with specified features; and (2) a voluntary protection program with specified features to encourage the achievement of excellence in both the technical and managerial protection of employees from occupational hazards.(Sec. 13) Authorizes employers to establish alcohol and substance abuse testing programs in accordance with specified Federal guidelines."
