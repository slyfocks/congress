Entitles such tribes or tribal organizations that employ an indirect cost pool that includes both funds paid under this Act and other Federal funds to use or expend all Federal funding received by such tribe or tribal organization in such pool in the same manner as permitted in provisions under the Act relating to allowable uses of funds without approval of the Secretary of any Federal agency providing funds to such tribe or tribal organization.Makes, within the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health and Human Services, tribal contract support cost entitlements the responsibility of the Office of Tribal Programs, subject to the tribe's or tribal organization's indirect cost rate agreement with its cognizant Federal agency.Provides that contract support costs that are eligible for the purposes of receiving funding under the Act include direct contract support costs associated with all Federal employees employed in connection with the program, service, function, or activity that is the subject of the contract, including all Federal employees paid with funds generated from third-party collections.Requires the Secretary of the Interior to pay preaward and startup costs without regard to the year in which such costs were incurred, including such costs identified by the Indian Health Service in a September 1999 report entitled \"FY 1999 IHS CSC Shortfall Data.\""
