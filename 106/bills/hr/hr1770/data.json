    "text": "Federal Employees' Overtime Pay Limitation Amendments Act of 1999 - Amends Federal Civil Service provisions regarding the computation of overtime pay to: (1) require that, for a Federal employee whose basic pay is at a rate which exceeds the minimum rate of basic pay for GS-10 (including any applicable locality-based comparability payment and any applicable special rate of pay), the overtime hourly rate of pay is an amount equal to the greater of one and one-half times the minimum hourly rate of basic pay for such grade or the hourly rate of the employee's basic pay, and all that amount is premium pay. Revises provisions regarding limitations on premium pay to: (1) allow an employee to be paid premium pay under certain circumstances only to the extent that the payment does not cause the aggregate rate of pay for any pay period for such employee to exceed the lesser of 150 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 or the rate payable for level V of the Executive Schedule; (2) prohibit an employee who is paid premium pay by reason of work in connection with an emergency which involves a direct threat to life or property, including a forest wildfire emergency, from being paid such pay if, or to the extent that, the aggregate of the basic pay and premium pay for such employee would, in any calendar year, exceed the lesser of 150 percent of the minimum rate of basic pay payable for GS-15 or the rate of pay for level V of the Executive Schedule; and (3) prohibit applying such premium pay limitation provisions to certain employees of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense."
