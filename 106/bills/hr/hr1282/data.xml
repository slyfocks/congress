Individual Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act of 1999 - Amends Federal bankruptcy law to prohibit a debtor filing for bankruptcy from exempting an interest that exceeds $100,000 in value, in the aggregate, in: (1) real or personal property that the debtor or dependent uses as a residence; (2) a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or dependent uses as a residence; or (3) a burial plot for the debtor or dependent. States that a discharge in bankruptcy shall not include consumer debts owed to a single creditor and aggregating more than $1,000 for luxury goods or services incurred by a debtor within 90 (currently 60) days before such discharge. Deletes a provision which prohibits an interested party in a bankruptcy proceeding from requesting a dismissal of such action.</summary>
