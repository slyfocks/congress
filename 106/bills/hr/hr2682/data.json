Requires the Secretary to assess a fee to defray the cost of the program.(Sec. 104) Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to prohibit the redistribution to a State of its unused apportionment of funds for Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction programs during a fiscal year, if the State that fails to reduce the number of fatalities in a year resulting from commercial motor vehicle crashes by at least five percent.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary, after notice and opportunity for comment, to issue regulations requiring the installation and use of on-board recorders or other technologies on commercial motor vehicles to manage driver hours of service.(Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on methods used to compensate drivers of commercial motor vehicles, and how they may affect safety and compliance with State and Federal motor carrier safety requirements (including hours of service regulations), including ways safety could be improved through changes in driver compensation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary to expend a specified amount from certain Federal-aid highway funds each fiscal year to carry out public information and education programs to prevent crashes involving commercial motor vehicles.(Sec. 108) Requires the Secretary to amend a specified regulation to require the periodic updating of the Motor Carrier Identification Report, Form MCS-150, by each motor carrier conducting operations in interstate or foreign commerce. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 109) Amends Federal transportation law to subject to civil and criminal penalties, to the same extent as the motor carrier or driver committing such violation, any person who knowingly aids, abets, commands, or induces a violation of Federal regulations pertaining to qualifications, hours of service, safety, and equipment standards with respect to motor carriers (including migrant worker motor carriers).(Sec. 110) Redefines \"imminent hazard\" for which a commercial motor vehicle may be ordered out of service to mean any violation, or series of violations, of specified Federal commercial motor carrier safety regulations that could result in a highway crash if not discontinued within 24 hours.(Sec.111) Directs the Secretary to carry out a pilot program with one or more States to develop innovative methods (including use of photography and other imaging technologies) of improving compliance with traffic laws, including those pertaining to highway-rail grade crossings. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 112) Directs the Secretary to conduct research on heavy vehicle safety, including measures to improve braking and stability, measures to improve vehicle compatibility in crashes between heavier and lighter vehicles, and measures to improve the performance of motor vehicle drivers. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 113) Directs the Secretary to carry out a program, in cooperation with the States, to improve the collection and analysis of data on crashes involving commercial vehicles. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 114) Authorizes appropriations for: (1) grants to States for the development and enforcement of Federal and State regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety; and (2) the establishment and operation of motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver information systems and data analysis programs to support safety regulatory and enforcement activities.Title II: Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety - Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Act of 1999 - Amends Federal rail transportation law to promote the establishment of emergency notification systems utilizing toll-free telephone numbers that the public can use to convey to railroad carriers (either directly or through public safety personnel) information about malfunctions of automated warning devices or other safety problems at highway-rail grade crossings.(Sec. 203) Amends railroad trespassing and vandalism provisions to require the Secretary to evaluate and review current local, State, and Federal laws regarding, among other things, violations of highway-rail grade crossing signals, and develop model prevention strategies and enforcement laws to be used for the consideration of State and local legislatures and governmental entities.Requires the Secretary to develop and make available to State and local governments model State legislation providing for civil or criminal penalties, or both, for violations of highway-rail grade crossing signals.(Sec. 204) Directs each railroad carrier to report to the Secretary, with periodic updates, certain information concerning each highway-rail crossing through which such carrier operates."
