  <summary>10/26/1999--Passed House amended.
Statistical Efficiency Act of 1999 - Designates Federal Statistical Data Centers within various Federal departments and agencies. Sets a prohibition against increasing the number of Statistical Data Centers authorized by this Act.Allows the OMB Director, in the case of a reorganization that eliminates or substantially alters the mission of an agency or agency component listed, to designate an agency or component to serve as a successor Statistical Data Center under specified conditions. Requires the head of an agency seeking designation as a successor Statistical Data Center, after consultation with the Director, to provide public notice and an opportunity to comment on the consequences of such designation and on those determinations upon which the designation is proposed to be based.(Sec. 4) Requires, among other things, that Statistical Data Centers: (1) identify opportunities to eliminate duplication and otherwise reduce the reporting burden and cost imposed on the public by sharing information for exclusively statistical purposes; and (2) safeguard the confidentiality of identifiable information acquired for statistical purposes.(Sec. 5) Requires: (1) data or information acquired by a Statistical Data Center for exclusively statistical purposes to be used by the Center only for such purposes; and (2) such data or information to not be disclosed in identifiable form for any purpose other than a statistical purpose without the informed consent of the respondent.Provides for Statistical Data Centers to clearly distinguish any data or information collected for non-statistical purposes (as authorized by law) by a rule that provides that the respondent supplying the data or information is fully informed, before it is collected, that it will be used for such purposes.(Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions for the disclosure of data or information by Federal agencies to one or more Statistical Data Centers for exclusively statistical purposes.(Sec. 7) Provides for coordination and oversight of confidentiality and disclosure policies by the Director. Requires the head of a Statistical Data Center to report to OMB: (1) each disclosure agreement entered into; (2) the results of any review of information security undertaken at the request of OMB; and (3) the results of any similar review undertaken on the initiative of the Statistical Data Center or an agency disclosing data or information. Requires the Director to include a summary of all reports submitted to the Director and any actions taken by the Director to advance the purposes of this Act in OMB's annual report to Congress on statistical programs.(Sec. 10) Directs the President to submit to the Congress, no later than the date that is 90 days after the enactment of this Act, any additional conforming changes in law necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.</summary>
