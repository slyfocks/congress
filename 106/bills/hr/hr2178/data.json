Allows the continuation of: (1) activities on, under, or affecting the lands designated as wilderness by this Act relating to the monitoring, operating, maintenance, repair, replacement, and use of the Colorado- Big Thompson Project (Project) and its facilities which were allowed as of June 1, 1998; and (2) any other activities that because of emergencies or catastrophic events become necessary for continued use of such Project and its facilities, subject only to reasonable restrictions established by the Secretary of the Interior to protect the wilderness values of such lands. Prohibits any restrictions on such activities that would prevent their occurrence or that would reduce the water supply provided by the Project or the Windy Gap Project."
