    "text": "Seabed Protection Act - Prohibits any person from engaging in bottom trawling or use of other mobile fishing gear on the seabed in specified marine areas until: (1) the National Marine Fisheries Service has completed a study and determined the effects of those practices; (2) the Secretary of Commerce has determined that the impacts of bottom trawling and such other mobile fishing gear on biodiversity, marine habitat, and productivity of fish stocks is negligible; and (3) the Secretary has approved and implemented fishery management plans that are developed by the appropriate regional fishery management councils, that encourage the use of fishing gears that are less destructive of habitat than bottom trawling and other mobile fishing gear, and that prohibit use of bottom trawling and other mobile fishing gear practices that threaten the continued sustainability of ecosystems.Directs the Secretary to report annually to specified congressional committees regarding the recovery of such marine areas from the effects of bottom trawling and use of other mobile fishing gear on the seabed.Provides that such prohibition shall not apply to an area after the Secretary publishes a finding that there are in effect, under State law or a fishery management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act measures that are at least as effective as those required under this Act in maintaining the sustainability of ecosystems in that area."
