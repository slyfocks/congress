    "text": "Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit to specified congressional committees an annual report on the problems caused by methamphetamine consumption in rural areas, small cities, and mid-size cities. (Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for each fiscal year after FY 1999. Makes sums appropriated available to the DEA for activities to alleviate the growing financial burden on rural communities, small cities, mid-size cities, and other communities resulting from the cleanup of clandestine laboratories and other drug related hazardous waste. Requires the Administrator of the DEA to establish within the DEA a select cadre of special agents with Spanish language capabilities who show work with State and local law enforcement agencies across the United States on matters relating to the combating of methamphetamine related drug trafficking. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to establish within the DEA four regional satellite training centers for purposes of providing clandestine laboratory training to Federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel, to establish such centers at appropriate locations throughout the United States, and to assign to such centers 12 special agents, four drug prevention specialists, and eight support personnel, as appropriate. Requires the drug prevention specialists to work with communities that have been previously assisted by the DEA's Mobile Enforcement and Regional Enforcement Teams to assist such communities in the development of drug prevention programs and coalitions and provide a solid foundation for the long-term elimination of drug trafficking, abuse, and violence in such communities. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Administrator to establish: (1) Advanced Clandestine Laboratory Investigations schools for State and local law enforcement personnel; (2) Additional Basic Clandestine Laboratory Certification schools for both DEA and State and local law enforcement personnel; and (3) a \"Train the Trainer\" program to provide State and local law enforcement personnel with the skills necessary to provide clandestine laboratory re-certification and awareness training to other law enforcement personnel within their jurisdictions. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Directs the Attorney General to submit to the Committees annually a report containing a detailed strategy to combat the problem of methamphetamine production and abuse in the United States. (Sec. 8) Amends of the Controlled Substances Act to prohibit the theft and transportation across State lines of stolen anhydrous ammonia. Directs the Administrator to seek to enter into an agreement with Iowa State University to permit the University to continue and expand its current research into the development of inert agents that, when added to anhydrous ammonia, eliminate the usefulness of anhydrous ammonia as an ingredient in the production of methamphetamine. Allows such agreement to provide for the provision to such University, on a reimbursable basis, of $500,000. Authorizes appropriations for the DEA for FY 2000."
