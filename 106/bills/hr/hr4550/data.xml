Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act of 2000 - Authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to law enforcement agencies (agencies) that: (1) have in effect an administrative process or an existing procedure that complies with officer rights requirements; or (2) certify that they will establish, within two years, an administrative process that complies with such requirements.Requires that the administrative process require that an agency that investigates an officer for matters which could reasonably lead to disciplinary action, including dismissal, demotion, suspension, or transfer, provide recourse for the officer that, at a minimum, includes: (1) access to any existing administrative process established by the employing agency prior to the imposition of any such disciplinary action; and (2) the right to a hearing before a fair and impartial board or hearing officer, the right to be represented by an attorney or other officer at such officer's expense, the right to confront any witness testifying against such officer, and the right to record all meetings.Specifies that nothing herein shall prevent the immediate suspension with pay of an officer: (1) whose continued presence on the job is considered to be a substantial and immediate threat to the welfare of the agency or the public; (2) who refuses to obey a direct order issued in conformance with the agency's written and disseminated rules and regulations; or (3) who is accused of committing an illegal act.Makes this Act inapplicable to an agency if the Attorney General determines that such agency has in effect an established civil service system, agency review board, grievance procedure, or personnel board which meets or exceeds the minimum standards set forth in this Act.Sets forth provisions regarding distribution of funds. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
