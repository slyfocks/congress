  <summary>3/4/1999--Introduced.
Y2K State and Local Government Assistance Programs Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make up to 75 grants to States (not more than two to any State) to carry out projects that: (1) make Y2K compliant the information technology used by a State or local government to administer one or more Federal, State, or local programs; and (2) use amounts received under the grant to supplement and not to supplant the level of State and local funds that would have been expended on efforts to achieve Y2K compliance. Requires each recipient to supplement the grant amounts received with an amount of funds from sources other than this Act that is 50 percent of the grant amount received. Allows the Secretary to waive or modify such matching requirement for any State that he or she determines would suffer undue hardship. (Sec. 4) Requires the Secretary to: (1) make such grants in accordance with competitive criteria which shall include the need for and the feasibility of the proposed Y2K compliance project; and (2) give priority to projects that relate to making Y2K compliant the information technology used to administer Federal welfare programs. (Sec. 5) Sets forth grant application requirements. (Sec. 6) Requires each recipient of grant amounts to submit annually to the Secretary a report that: (1) describes the status and results of the Y2K compliance project for which the grant was made; and (2) includes an independent evaluation of such project. Requires the Secretary to submit a final report to Congress describing and evaluating the activities carried out under this Act. (Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
