    "text": "Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), notwithstanding its order in the proceeding in re Applications of Cellwave Telephone Services L.P., Futurewave General Partners L.P., and Great Western Cellular Partners, to: (1) reinstate each of three specified applicants as a selectee under the covered rural service area licensing proceeding; and (2) permit application amendments, at any time before final licensing action in the covered rural service area, in order to update factual information and comply with FCC rules. Prohibits the submission of petitions to deny such applications. Directs the FCC to: (1) award licenses under such proceeding within 90 days after enactment of this Act; (2) require such applicant to provide cellular radiotelephone service to subscribers in accordance with FCC rules (reducing from five to three years the period in which such applicant may expand the system within that market); and (3) establish a fee for each of the licenses under the proceeding (requiring each applicant to pay such fee within 18 months after its application is granted). Prohibits the FCC, during the five-year period after an application license is granted, from authorizing the transfer or assignment of that license."
