    "text": "Handgun Licensing Act of 1999 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the Act) to prohibit the sale, delivery, or other transfer of a handgun or handgun ammunition to an individual not licensed to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms, or importing or manufacturing ammunition, unless: (1) the transferor, or a licensed dealer, if State law so directs or allows (transferor), has examined a valid handgun license issued to the individual by the State in which the transaction takes place and an additional valid identification document containing a photograph of the individual and has contacted the chief law enforcement officer of the State (officer) and has been informed by the officer that the handgun license has not been revoked; and (2) three business days have elapsed from the date on which the transferor received such information, or the individual has presented to the transferor a written document, issued not less than ten days earlier by the appropriate officer, stating that the transferee requires access to a handgun because of a threat to the life of the transferee or any member of the transferee's household.Prohibits an unlicenced individual from receiving a handgun or handgun ammunition without possessing a valid handgun license issued to the individual by the State in which the transaction takes place.Defines \"handgun license\" to mean a license issued under a State law that: (1) provides for the issuance and revocation of licenses permitting persons to receive handguns and handgun ammunition; (2) provides for the reporting of losses and thefts of handguns and handgun ammunition; and (3) at a minimum, meets the requirements of this Act. Requires such State law to provide that a handgun license shall: (1) be issued by the officer; (2) contain the licensee's name, address, date of birth, and physical description, a unique license number, and a photograph of the licensee; and (3) remain valid for not more than two years unless revoked.Requires such State law to provide that, before a handgun license is issued to an applicant, the officer determine that the applicant: (1) has attained age 21; (2) is a resident of the State by examining, in addition to a valid identification document, a utility bill or lease agreement; (3) is not prohibited from possessing or receiving a handgun under Federal, State, or local law based upon name- and fingerprint-based research in all available Federal, State, and local recordkeeping systems, including the national instant criminal background check system established under the Act; and (4) has been issued a handgun safety certificate by the State (applicant requirements).Requires such State law to provide that: (1) if the officer determines that an individual is ineligible to receive a handgun license, and the individual requests in writing that the officer provide the reasons for the determination, the officer shall provide the reasons to the individual in writing within 20 business days after receipt of the request; (2) a handgun license issued by the State shall be revoked if the officer determines that the licensee no longer meets applicant requirements; (3) within ten days after a person receives notice from the State that the handgun license issued to the person has been revoked, the person shall return the license to the officer of the State in which the licensee resides; (4) within 24 hours after a handgun licensee discovers the theft of any firearm from, or the loss of any firearm by, the licensee, the licensee shall report the theft or loss to the Secretary, the officer, and appropriate local authorities; (5) any failure to make such a report shall be punishable by a civil penalty, with a maximum penalty of at least $1,000; (6) the officer shall issue the handgun safety certificate; and (7) such a certificate shall not be issued unless the officer determines that the applicant has completed a course of not less than two hours of handgun safety instruction and has passed an examination testing the applicant's knowledge of handgun safety.Amends the Act to define \"handgun ammunition\" to mean: (1) a center-fire cartridge or cartridge case less than 1.3 inches in length; or (2) a primer, bullet, or propellant powder designed specifically for use in a handgun.Sets penalties for violations of this Act.Directs the Attorney General to make a grant to each State to cover the initial startup costs associated with establishing a licensing system. Authorizes appropriations.Requires an applicant for a license to certify that the business is covered by an insurance policy which provides personal injury protection, to a limit of $100,000, to any person who, while engaged in lawful activity, suffers bodily injury or death through the use of a handgun obtained as a result of the applicant's negligence."
