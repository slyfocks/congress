Provides for related Corporation consultation with State FSA committees.Directs: (1) the Secretary to establish procedures to permit the Corporation to identify agents and loss adjusters with disparate claims performance records; and (2) the Corporation to review such persons and take remedial action, and develop related oversight procedures.Establishes civil penalty and disqualification sanctions for program abuse and fraud.Makes specified funds available for such activities for FY 2001 through 2005.(Sec. 122) Provides for protection of confidential information, including application of specified (confidentiality) penalties under the Food Security Act of 1985.(Sec. 123) Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to include scientifically sound and sustainable and organic farming practices as good farming practices for purposes of insurable crop loss determinations. Provides producers with a related administrative review process.(Sec. 124) Sets forth recordkeeping and reporting provisions.Subtitle C: Research and Pilot Programs - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to direct the Corporation to: (1) reimburse applicants for research, development, and maintenance costs for insurance policies that are approved and offered for producer sale; (2) establish pasture, range, and forage program priorities; (3) conduct a multiyear coverage study; and (4) enter into research contracts respecting cost of production policy and revenue coverage plans.Authorizes the Corporation to enter into partnership contracts with private and public entities for risk management development and implementation, with objectives regarding: (1) weather notification; (2) pest management and fertilization; (3) crop and livestock techniques; (4) labor issues; and (5) fire prevention.
