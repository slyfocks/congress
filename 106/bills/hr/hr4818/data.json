Directs the Secretary, upon certification of a country, to pay to such country, every three months, an amount equal to a specified formula. Prohibits the previously dollarized Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, Panama, East Timor, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the British Virgin Islands from being certified as officially dollarized or issued payments until specified conditions are met."
