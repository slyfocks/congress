EMS Employee Equality Act of 2000 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to prohibit the National Labor Relations Board from deciding that a bargaining unit is appropriate, if the unit is composed of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and other employees, unless a majority of such EMTs vote for inclusion in such unit. Defines such EMTs as employees of an acute care hospital whose primary duty is provision of emergency medical services before arrival to a hospital or ambulance transportation.</summary>
