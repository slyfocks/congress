Moves from the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act provisions relating to additions to the System of excess government property and amends the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 to repeal notice provisions relating to the moved provisions. Amends the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to impose notice requirements regarding any System addition. (Sec. 4) Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. (Sec. 5) Mandates a pilot project and report to a specified House of Representatives committee on the feasibility and cost of creating digital versions of System maps. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Mandates corrections to the System map for unit P19-P (North Captiva Island, Florida) to make that map consistent with a specified map. (Sec. 7) Replaces seven System maps relating to units NC-03P and L03 in Dare County, North Carolina, with other specified maps. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to make corrections to a specified Coastal Barrier Resources map as necessary to move the boundary of the otherwise-protected area to the Cape Henlopen Sate Park boundary to the extent necessary to exclude from the otherwise- protected area the adjacent property leased by the Barcroft Company and Cape Shores Associates, privately held corporations under the law of the State of Delaware, and to include in the otherwise-protected area the northeastern corner of Cape Henlopen State Park seaward of the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal."
