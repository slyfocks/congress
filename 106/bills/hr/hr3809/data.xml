  <summary>3/1/2000--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to require the Postal Service to establish a special rate of postage for first class mail that is up to 25 percent higher than the regular rate as a voluntary alternative that the public may use to contribute to funding for organ and tissue donation awareness.Requires collected amounts to be paid to the Department of Health and Human Services.Expresses the sense of the Congress that nothing in this Act should: (1) cause a net decrease in total funds received by the Department of Health and Human Services or any other Federal agency below the level that would have otherwise been received but for this Act's enactment; or (2) affect first-class or other regular postage rates.Requires special postage stamps to be made available to the public.</summary>
