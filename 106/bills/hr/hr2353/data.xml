  <summary>6/24/1999--Introduced.
New York Convention Compliance Act - Amends the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 to set forth additional requirements regarding the accession of a country to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement to require the President to determine whether a country that is a party to the Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention) is fulfilling its obligations under the New York Convention before it can accede to such Agreement. Provides that, if the President makes a negative determination with respect to a country, then: (1) the President shall reserve the right of the United States to withhold extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and the country; and (2) the WTO Agreement shall not apply between the United States and such country until either the President certifies to Congress that the country is fulfilling its obligations under the New York Convention, or a bill submitted to Congress approving the extension of the application of the WTO Agreement between the United States and the country is enacted into law.</summary>
