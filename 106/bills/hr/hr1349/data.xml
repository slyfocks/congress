  <summary>9/19/2000--Passed House amended.
Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to assess and collect a fee for health care services provided in connection with each health care visit (which excludes a prisoner-initiated visit pursuant to a staff referral or to obtain staff-approved follow-up treatment for a chronic condition) requested by a prisoner, except for preventative health care services, emergency services, prenatal care, diagnosis or treatment of chronic infectious diseases, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment.Requires that each fee assessed be collected by the Director: (1) from the account of the prisoner receiving health care services; or (2) if such services are provided because of an injury inflicted by another prisoner, from the account of the prisoner who inflicted the injury. Sets a minimum fee of one dollar. Specifies that the prisoner's consent shall not be required for the collection of the fee (but each prisoner shall be given a reasonable opportunity to dispute the amount of the fee or whether the prisoner qualifies under an exclusion).Specifies that nothing herein may be construed to permit refusal of treatment to a prisoner on the basis that: (1) the prisoner's account is insolvent; or (2) the prisoner is otherwise unable to pay.Requires that sums collected under this Act: (1) be used for restitution of the victims where the prisoner is subject to a restitution order; and (2) be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund (75 percent) and be available to the Attorney General for administrative expenses incurred in carrying out this Act (25 percent) where the prisoner is not subject to such an order.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) notice to prisoners regarding this Act's provisions and related regulations; (2) notice before a public comment period; and (3) reporting requirements by the Director, including an itemization of the cost of implementing and administering the program, a description of current inmate health status indicators as compared to the year prior to enactment, and a description of the quality of health care services provided during the 12-month period ending on this Act's enactment date.Directs the Bureau to provide comprehensive coverage for services relating to human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) to each Federal prisoner in the Bureau's custody when medically appropriate. Prohibits the Bureau from assessing or collecting a fee for providing such coverage.(Sec. 3) Amends the code to authorize a State or local government to assess and collect a reasonable fee from a Federal prisoner's trust fund account (or institutional equivalent) for health care services if the prisoner is confined in a non-Federal institution under specified circumstances. Sets forth provisions regarding notice to prisoners regarding this Act's provisions and regarding State or local implementation thereof.Requires that any State or local government assessing or collecting a fee under this section provide comprehensive coverage for services relating to HIV and AIDS to each Federal prisoner in the custody of such State or local government when medically appropriate. Prohibits the State or local government from assessing or collecting a fee for providing such coverage.</summary>
