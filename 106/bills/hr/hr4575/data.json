    "text": "Veterans Service Improvement Act of 2000 - Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a program in not more than four geographically dispersed areas of the United States to improve access to and coordination of inpatient care of eligible veterans. Allows the Secretary, under the program, to pay reasonable costs of hospital care and services furnished to a program participant in a non-Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Requires the amount paid to be reduced by any copayment that the veteran would have been required to pay in a Department hospital for such care and services. Makes eligible for the program a veteran who: (1) is enrolled to receive medical services from a Department outpatient clinic; (2) requires such care and services for a non-service-connected condition and could not receive such services from a Department clinic; and (3) elects to receive such care under a health plan to which such individual is entitled.Requires at least 60 percent of the veterans residing in a designated area to reside at least two hours driving distance from the closest Department medical center that provides appropriate care.Directs the Secretary to submit to the congressional veterans' committees two reports on the implementation and operation of the program."
