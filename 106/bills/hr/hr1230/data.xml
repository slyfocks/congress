Allows any private or public entity to submit a claim for such damages.

Grants any such entity that submits such a claim that is rejected by the Secretary: (1) a right to an appeal to State court; and (2) the right to a civil trial by jury if the amount in dispute, including litigation costs, is $20,000 or greater.</summary>
