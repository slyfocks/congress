Rocky Flats Open Space Act - Declares that: (1) all Federal right, title, and interest to lands within the boundaries of the Rocky Flats site (Colorado) shall be retained by the United States; (2) the buffer zone shall be managed as open space; (3) the structures that comprise the former Lindsay Ranch homestead site within the Rock Creek Reserve area of the buffer zone shall be preserved and maintained to protect their historic significance; and (4) open space management of the buffer zone shall not be construed to affect management of the industrial area, or to preclude its management as open space after cleanup and closure is completed.Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) establish the Rocky Flats Open Space Advisory Council to examine options for long-term oversight and management of the Rocky Flats site and to make recommendations for its oversight and management; (2) ensure that Council membership includes representatives from designated Federal, State, and local entities; and (3) continue implementation of clean-up and closure activities at the site and, if necessary, within the buffer zone.</summary>
