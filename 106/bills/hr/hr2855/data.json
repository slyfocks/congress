Requires as parts of the system that the State: (1) have in effect laws requiring the use of certain procedures; and (2) establish a State reserve trust unit to carry out such laws and procedures.Requires a State reserve unit to: (1) withhold the net proceeds from the sale or refinancing of real property in the State against which a lien for overdue child support by the seller or refinancer has arisen; (2) hold a certain amount of such proceeds (anticipated future child support) in trust for the benefit of the child or children for whom the person has a support obligation; and (3) apply such amounts to satisfy such overdue child support, if all other available remedies are insufficient to do so."
