Requires the Department of Justice to conduct such review and make recommendations to resolve the complaint not later than 30 days after a petition is filed.Makes the right to review by the Department of Justice available to any complainant with a complaint that: (1) is not considered an eligible complaint under specified time criteria (eligible complaints were filed before July 1, 1997, and allege discrimination occurred between 1981 and 1996); and (2) is pending at the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Agriculture on this Act's enactment date.Deems complainants to have exhausted administrative remedies after review is completed and authorizes the filing of actions after such time in a district court. Requires the tolling of any statute of limitations beginning on the date the complaint was filed at the Department of Agriculture and ending on date of completion of review by the Department of Justice."
