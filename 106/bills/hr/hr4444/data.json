Subjects such investigations to certain requirements of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding limitations on investigations of injuries from import competition and procedures concerning the release of confidential business information.Declares a market disruption to exist whenever imports of an article like or directly competitive with an article produced by a domestic industry are increasing rapidly, either absolutely or relatively, so as to be a significant cause of material injury, or threat of material injury, to the domestic industry.Directs the ITC, if it makes an affirmative determination that market disruption exists, to propose the amount of increase in, or imposition of, any duty or other import restrictions necessary to prevent or remedy the market disruption. Requires the ITC to report to the President and the USTR with respect to its determination, including any recommendations. Requires the USTR to provide notice and the opportunity for public comment with respect to any proposed measure of the ITC.Directs the ITC to take certain actions with respect to a petition which alleges that critical circumstances exist and requests relief with respect to a particular product. Requires the ITC in such cases: (1) to determine whether delay in taking action would cause damage to the domestic industry which would be difficult to repair; and (2) if there is an affirmative determination, to make a preliminary determination of whether imports of the product which is the subject of the investigation have caused or threatened to cause market disruption. Requires the President, within ten days after receiving the USTR's recommendation with respect to an affirmative determination, to determine whether to provide provisional relief in the form of: (1) the imposition of or increase in any duty; (2) any modification, or imposition of any quantitative restriction on the importation of an article into the United States; or (3) any combination of such actions.Authorizes the USTR to enter into agreements with China to take any action necessary to prevent or remedy market disruption. Urges the USTR to seek to conclude such agreements within a specified time period.

Urges the USTR to conclude such agreements within a specified time period. Requires the President, within 20 days after receiving the USTR's recommendation concerning the trade diversion, to determine what action to take to prevent or remedy such diversion or its threat. Requires the ITC to review the continued need for trade relief taken under this Act if a WTO member notifies the Committee on Safeguards of the WTO of any modification in the action taken by them against China.Directs the President to provide by regulation for the efficient and fair administration of any restriction imposed under this Act.Division B: United States-China Relations - Title II: General Provisions - U.S.-China Relations Act of 2000 - Declares it to be the policy of the United States to: (1) develop trade relations that broaden the benefits of trade, and that lead to an increase, rather than a decrease, of labor, environmental, commercial rule of law, market access, anticorruption, and other standards across national borders; (2) pursue effective enforcement of trade-related and other international commitments by foreign governments through enforcement mechanisms of international organizations and through the application of U.S. law; (3) encourage the People's Republic of China to afford its workers internationally recognized worker rights and to protect the human rights of its people; and (4) highlight in the United Nations Human Rights Commission and in other appropriate fora violations of human rights by foreign governments, and seek the support of other governments in urging improvements in human rights practices.Title III: Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China - Establishes a Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China which shall: (1) monitor the acts of China which reflect compliance with or violation of certain human rights, in particular, those contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; (2) compile lists of persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or placed under house arrest, tortured, or otherwise persecuted by the Government of China due to the pursuit of their human rights; (3) monitor the development of the rule of law in China; (4) monitor and encourage the development of programs and activities of the U.S. Government and private organizations with a view toward increasing the interchange of people and ideas between the United States and China and expanding cooperation in areas that include, but are not limited to, increasing enforcement of human rights and developing the rule of law.
