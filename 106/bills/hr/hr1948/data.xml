Broadcasters Fairness in Advertising Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit any person from purchasing or placing an advertisement by wire or radio communication which discriminates against any communications entity by reason of the race, color, or ethnic background of: (1) any entity owner; or (2) the group to which the communications format of the entity is predominately designed to appeal. Authorizes either a private person or the Federal Communications Commission to bring an action for appropriate relief. Prohibits the head of an executive agency from soliciting an offer from, or awarding a contract or subcontract to, any offeror or contractor who has failed to certify that they have not engaged in such prohibited activity and will not so engage during the period of the contract or subcontract.</summary>
