Authorizes either a private person or the Federal Communications Commission to bring an action for appropriate relief. Prohibits the head of an executive agency from soliciting an offer from, or awarding a contract or subcontract to, any offeror or contractor who has failed to certify that they have not engaged in such prohibited activity and will not so engage during the period of the contract or subcontract."
