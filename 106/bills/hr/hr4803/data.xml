  <summary>6/29/2000--Introduced.
National Flood Insurance Program Fairness Act - Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to replace requirements for the notification of changes to flood insurance map panels (thus, repealing them) with the following new requirements for the notification and appeal of such changes.Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide notice of any change to flood insurance map panels, including any change in a letter of map amendment or a letter of map revision by: (1) providing the chief executive officer of each community affected by the change, by registered mail, a copy of the revised maps for such community and a statement explaining the process under this Act to appeal to the Director for changes in such revised maps; and (2) causing notice of such changes to be published in the Federal Register, and a statement explaining the process (under this Act) to appeal to the Director for changes in such revised maps.Allows a community affected by the change to appeal the change.Requires the Director: (1) during a 30-day period that begins upon the receipt of an objection, to determine whether to deny the objection, revise the changes to the panels in response to the objection, or to grant additional time to the community to obtain evidence related to the objection; and (2) to notify the chief executive of the community, in writing and by registered mail, of such determination.Requires the Director, not later than 30 days after any final determination as described by this Act, to provide written notification to each owner of real property affected by the change to panels resulting from such determination.Requires the Director, if an owner of real property affected by a change to panels incurs expense in connection with the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services (but not legal services) in effecting any appeal of such change to the Director which is successful, to reimburse such individual for such expense.Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to repeal the requirement for the publication or notification of proposed flood elevation determinations to require the Director, in establishing projected flood elevations for land use purposes for any community, to first propose such determinations by: (1) providing the chief executive officer of each community affected by the proposed elevations, by registered mail, notice of the elevations, including a copy of the maps and a statement explaining the process to appeal for changes in such elevations; (2) causing notice of such elevations to be published in the Federal Register, which shall include a statement explaining the process to appeal for changes in such elevations; and (3) publishing the elevations in a prominent local newspaper.</summary>
