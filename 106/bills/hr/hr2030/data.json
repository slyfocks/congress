Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) accept recommendations for Health Care Financing Administration Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) level II code modifications yearly from the public; (2) cause determinations on recommendations received during the three months immediately preceding the last month of a calendar quarter to be made not later than the first day of the following calendar quarter; and (3) incorporate approved modifications to HCPCS level II codes into the payment systems established under Medicare not later than 180 days after the determination approving a modification was made. Prohibits the Secretary from requiring a minimum period of marketing experience with respect to a drug or device as a condition of consideration or approval of a recommendation for a HCPCS level II modification for such drug or device. Directs the Secretary to maintain and continue the use of HCPCS level III codes (as in effect on June 1, 1999), and to make them available to the public."
