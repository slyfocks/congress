  <summary>6/7/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to repeal provisions that excluded firearms, shells, and cartridges from the definition of "consumer product." Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful for any person to import or manufacture a handgun unless the weapon: (1) cannot be fired with the average hand and finger strength of a four year old child; (2) cannot be fired without an ammunition magazine or clip attached; (3) has a locking feature that cannot be removed without making the weapon inoperable; or (4) has a mechanism that visibly and noticeably indicates whether ammunition is present in the weapon. Mandates, for knowing violations: (1) fines or imprisonment (or both); and (2) revocation of a license to import, manufacture, or deal in firearms or import or manufacture ammunition.</summary>
