  <summary>7/20/1999--Introduced.
Child Protection Act of 1999 - Requires any elementary or secondary school or public library that has received Federal funds for the acquisition or operation of any computer that is accessible to minors and that has access to the Internet to: (1) install software on that computer adequately designed to prevent minors from obtaining access to any obscene information or child pornography; and (2) ensure that such software is operational whenever that computer is used by minors. Allows temporary interruption of software operation to permit a minor, under the direct supervision of an adult designated by the school or library, to have access to information that is not obscene, is not child pornography, or is otherwise unprotected by the Constitution. Requires determinations of adequate design to be made by an agency or official designated by the State Governor. Authorizes Federal agency heads to respond to violations of this Act by seeking remedies, in the same manner as under the General Education Provisions Act, including withholding of further payments, issuing a complaint to compel compliance through a cease and desist order, or entering into a compliance agreement with the recipient of funds. Prohibits seeking recovery of funds from the recipient.</summary>
