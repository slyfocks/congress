  <summary>7/27/2000--Introduced.
Amends Federal transportation law to delay the effective date for implementing regulations requiring that a locomotive horn be sounded by each train that approaches and enters upon each public highway-rail grade crossing. Amends the definition of supplementary safety measure which does not require the sounding of a locomotive horn for the prevention of highway-rail casualties. Excludes from such definition adequate median barriers that prevent movement around crossing gates. Repeals the exclusion from (thus including in) the meaning of supplementary safety measure any flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad.</summary>
