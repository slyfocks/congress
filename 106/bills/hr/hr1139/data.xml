(Sec. 101) Reserves specified portions of such funds for payments to Indian tribes and for quality assurance and quality improvement activities relating to programs under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBGA). Provides for allotment of funds among the States and territories according to a specified formula, or for matching payments based on certain portions of their expenditures for specified purposes authorized under CCDBGA. Requires targeting of at least 70 percent of such subsidy for child care assistance funds to working non-welfare families, who are not TANF recipients under a State or territory program. Title II: Dependent Care Tax Credit Reform - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the dependent care tax credit and to provide an equivalent benefit where one parent stays at home to provide child care for child under age one. (Sec. 202) Allows a business-related tax credit for employer expenses for employer-provided child care assistance. (Sec. 203) Allows the dependent care credit against the alternative minimum tax. Title III: Grants to Business Consortia - Subtitle A: Grant Program - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make grants to States to provide grants to eligible entities to improve access to affordable, local, quality child care services. (Sec. 301) Makes eligible for such a grant a consortium that: (1) has not received a grant under this title; and (2) consists of representatives from at least five businesses (or a nonprofit organization that represents at least five businesses), each of which, to the maximum extent practicable, is located in the same geographic region. Requires States to give priority, in providing such grants, to eligible entities that consist of a majority of representatives from small businesses. Sets a maximum limit on the amount of any such grant provided to an eligible entity for any fiscal year. (Sec. 302) Sets forth requirements for grant applications, use of funds, and matching funds. Subtitle B: General Provisions - Authorizes appropriations for such child care services grants to business consortia. Title IV: After School Program - Subtitle A: 21st Century Community Learning Centers - Amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to require that discretionary grants be awarded to local educational agencies (LEAs) for supporting certain programs of public elementary schools or secondary schools, including middle schools, that serve communities with substantial needs for expanded learning opportunities for children and youth. (Sec. 401) Increases the maximum duration of such a grant from three to five years. (Sec. 402) Requires the LEA to demonstrate that it will provide specified portions of the annual costs of project activities from sources other than such grant funds. (Sec. 403) Requires the use of grant funds to establish or expand community learning centers that provide activities that offer expanded learning opportunities for children and youth in the community (such as activities conducted before or after school), and which may include any of the currently authorized activities. (Sec. 405) Extends through FY 2004 the authorization of appropriations for such Act. Authorizes continuation awards of FY 1998 grants. Subtitle B: After School Snacks - Amends the National School Lunch Act to provide for participation by certain additional institutions under the child and adult care food program. Allows such institutions to claim reimbursements for meal supplements which they serve without charge to children in afterschool care. (Sec. 411) Revises eligibility requirements for meal supplements for children in afterschool care. Title V: Model States Early Learning Program - Amends SSA title IV part A (TANF) to make appropriations for FY 2000 through 2004 for model States early learning programs. Provides for allotment of funds among the States, territories, and Indian tribes according to a specified formula, or for matching payments based on portions of their expenditures for an early learning program under CCDBGA. (Sec. 501) Amends CCDBGA to establish the Model States Early Learning Program. Sets forth program requirements for State participation and plans, allowable activities, and annual reports. Title VI: Child Care Worker Incentives - Child Care Worker Incentive Act of 1999 - Amends CCDBGA to establish a national child care provider scholarship program. (Sec. 602) Sets forth eligibility criteria for scholarship applicants, including: (1) demonstrated commitment to a child care career; (2) cost sharing by the applicant and employer; and (3) the employer's agreement to provide increased financial incentives to the employee upon completion of the education or training. Includes such program under requirements for State plans, allotments, payments, and annual reports. Authorizes appropriations. Title VII: Research and Demonstration Program - Amends CCDBGA to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), directly or through grants, contracts, or other arrangements, to carry out research, demonstration projects, and other activities relating to child care, including activities designed to improve the quality and increase the availability of child care. (Sec. 701) Includes among allowable activities under such research and demonstrations program: (1) research on child care needs of low-income families, on good policies and practices, and on retention of child care provider staff; (2) demonstrations of technology-based education and training; (3) demonstration projects for new methods; (4) a National Center on Child Care Statistics; and (5) a hotline to locate local child care resources, and child care consumer education activities. Authorizes appropriations. Title VIII: Miscellaneous - Subtitle A: Child and Adult Food Program - Amends the National School Lunch Act to increase reimbursement rates for family or group day care homes under the child and adult care food program. Subtitle B: Mortgage Insurance for Child Care and Development Facilities - Children's Development Commission Act - Amends the National Housing Act to authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to insure mortgages for: (1) new or rehabilitated child care and development facilities, including mortgage insurance for fire safety equipment loans; and (2) purchase or refinance of existing child care and development facilities. (Sec. 855) Establishes the Children's Development Commission which shall: (1) issue facility standards and compliance certifications; and (2) make loans not in excess of $50,000 for facility rehabilitation or renovation.
