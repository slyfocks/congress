(Retains the current requirement that a recipient must either have received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or TANF for 30 months or be within 12 months of losing eligibility because of a time limit.)Prescribes criteria for the provision of project funds to assist certain noncustodial parents to participate in employment or related activities that will enable them to make regular child support payments.
