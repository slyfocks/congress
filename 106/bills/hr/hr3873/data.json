    "text": "Alternative Education for Safe Schools and Safe Communities Act of 2000 - Title I: Alternative Education Program - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to add to title IV (Safe and Drug-Free Communities) a new part B, Alternative Education Financing and Establishment Grants. (Currently title IV has a part A but no part B.)Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) allocate such part B funds among States on the basis of relative amounts received under the ESEA title I (Helping Disadvantaged Students Meet High Standards) part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies); and (2) reserve specified portions of such funds for outlying areas and for programs for Indian children. Allows reservation of certain amounts for national evaluation and national activities.Requires each State educational agency (SEA) to distribute at least 95 percent of its State allotment to local educational agencies (LEAs). Allows the remainder to be used for State-level activities and evaluation, including a limited amount for administration.Sets forth requirements for SEA applications and their approval, SEA activities, and State performance measures for part B programs.Directs each SEA to distribute part B funds to LEAs on a competitive grant basis if the State allotment is less than a specified amount, and on a formula grant basis if such allotment equals or exceeds such amount. Requires such competitive grant awards to: (1) go to LEAs with approved applications that can demonstrate a significant number of incidents of children age five through 21 who have been suspended or expelled from public school; (2) give priority to LEAs in which more than 30 percent of the children are from low-income families; (3) be of sufficient size and scope so as to be effective; (4) be distributed on an equitable geographic basis; and (5) be by peer review application approval. Requires distribution of such formula grant awards as follows: (1) 80 percent of funds to LEAs based on relative numbers of children, age five through 17, who reside in their school districts from families with incomes below the poverty line; and (2) 20 percent to LEAs based on relative enrollments in public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools within their boundaries. Sets the Federal share of part B programs at: (1) 65 percent for LEAs with poverty levels above 30 percent; and (2) 35 percent for those with levels below that.Sets forth requirements for local applications and their approval, and for LEA uses of part B funds.Requires State and national program evaluations and reports.Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct research to develop and identify proven alternative education practices; and (2) disseminate such practices to SEAs and LEAs receiving part B funds. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out, directly or through grants or contracts, programs and activities consistent with the purposes of this Act, such as collection of data, dissemination of information, and development of model programs and activities.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or the Gun-Free Schools Act.Authorizes appropriations."
