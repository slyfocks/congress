    "text": "Abandoned Mine Restoration Act of 1999 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out a program, managed by the head of the Sacramento District Office of the Corps of Engineers, to assist stewards of lands owned by the United States and non-Federal entities to address environmental and water quality problems caused by drainage and related activities from abandoned, inactive, and post-production noncoal mines.Permits the Secretary to provide technical, planning, design, restoration, remediation, and construction assistance to Federal and non-Federal entities for carrying out projects to address such environmental and water quality problems, but only if the Secretary determines that such a project will improve environmental quality, is in the public interest, and is cost-effective.Requires that the Federal share of the cost of a project to be 100 percent for projects carried out on Federal land and 65 percent for other projects. Sets forth provisions governing Federal cost share credits and reimbursements to non-Federal entities for project resources, services, and work.Requires that the non-Federal share of operation and maintenance costs for a project to be 100 percent, except that in the case of a project undertaken on Federal lands, the Federal agency with management responsibility for the lands shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance costs.Prohibits more than $10 million from being allotted for projects in a single locality, but permits the Secretary to accept funds voluntarily contributed by the non-Federal or Federal entity for expanding the scope of services requested.Prohibits the Secretary or any State or political subdivision which implements any remedial action which is consistent with a State and Environmental Protection Agency approved remediation plan at an abandoned mine site and adjacent lands to provide water quality protection from being treated, based on actions taken consistent with the plan, as being: (1) the site owner or operator or the arranger or transporter for disposal; (2) responsible for any discharge or release of pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous substances on or from the abandoned mine site or adjacent lands; or (3) subject to any enforcement action pursuant to Federal law, except for violations involving gross negligence.Authorizes the Secretary to provide assistance to the Western Universities Mine-Land Reclamation and Restoration Consortium for carrying out the purposes of the program.Authorizes appropriations."
