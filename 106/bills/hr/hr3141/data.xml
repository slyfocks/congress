  <summary>10/25/1999--Introduced.
Personal Watercraft Responsible Use Act of 1999 - Directs the Secretary of Commerce to withhold up to ten percent of grants made to a coastal State for development and administration of a management program for the land and water resources of its coastal zone in each fiscal year unless such State implements certain enforceable policies prohibiting a person from operating a personal watercraft in excess of no-wake speed in its coastal waters. Requires a coastal State's management program to include provisions that designate sensitive areas of its coast with respect to the enforcement of such policies in such areas. Authorizes a State to use such grants to develop and implement the enforceable policies under this Act.Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish certain guidelines and standards for the operation of personal watercraft, consistent with the enforceable policies, in the national boating safety program. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make recreational boating law enforcement grants to States that have: (1) implemented a recreational boating safety program incorporating the national guidelines and standards for personal watercraft; and (2) adopted the enforceable policies under this Act, if the State is a coastal State. Requires States, as a condition of receiving a grant, to provide matching funds on a one-to-one basis of Federal-to-State contributions.Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the availability of appropriations, to make grants to States to support the activities of collaborative task forces to minimize conflicts between personal watercraft and other recreational and commercial users. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to award task force development grants on a competitive basis, with no State receiving more than 25 percent of the total amount appropriated for a fiscal year. Sets forth similar matching fund requirements.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
