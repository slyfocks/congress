Authorizes: (1) a shared housing referral agency to request the Attorney General to conduct and share criminal background checks respecting shared housing caretaker applicants; and (2) the Attorney General to charge a fee for such service. Provides a criminal penalty for the knowing use of such information for other than housing determinations. States that an agency that reasonably relies upon such information shall not be liable for damages based on such information's inaccuracy."
