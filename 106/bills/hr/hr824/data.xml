  <summary>2/24/1999--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should inform the Polish Government of Polish-Americans who deserve to have their citizenship restored and claims to their wrongfully expropriated homes and properties considered under a fair rule of law that provides for compensation and restitution regardless of a claimant's current nationality; (2) the Polish Government should fulfill its responsibilities to consider the claims of these victims under such rule; and (3) the President should instruct U.S. representatives to all multilateral treaty-based institutions to work to deny admission or financial benefits to the Polish Government until it fulfills these responsibilities.</summary>
