  <summary>9/13/2000--Introduced.
Veterans Healthcare Fairness Act - Preserves veterans' disability compensation payments, as well as survivors' dependency and indemnity compensation, in the case of service-connected disabled Persian Gulf War veterans who voluntarily participate in a health study sponsored by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and who, as a result of such participation, are diagnosed as having a motor neuron disease for which a presumption of service-connection is no longer warranted. Requires the Secretary to restore benefits for any such veterans (or their survivors) whose benefits were terminated before the enactment of this Act.</summary>
