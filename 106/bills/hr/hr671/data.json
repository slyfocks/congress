Provides for an increase in the amount of assets allowable for children in foster care under SSA title IV part E. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish an action plan to promote collaboration between HHS and other Federal programs to promote the self-sufficiency of children aging out of foster care. Provides, with respect to the independent living initiatives program under SSA title IV part E, for: (1) the use of updated foster care data in the funding formula for determining the basic amount for such program for a State for a fiscal year (while removing State entitlement to such basic amount under State plan provisions); and (2) a funding increase under such program."
