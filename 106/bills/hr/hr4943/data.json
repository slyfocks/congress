    "text": "Small Business Federal Acquisition Simplification Act of 2000 - Amends the Small Business Act to require each acquisition of goods or services by an authorized individual (individual) using a government-wide commercial purchase card (card) to be from a small business unless no such small business: (1) provides goods or services of the same kind or comparable nature; (2) can provide the goods or services within the required time; or (3) can meet quality standards established in writing by the acquiring agency. Requires an individual who uses such card to acquire such goods or services from other than a small business to: (1) report such acquisition to that agency's person responsible for acquisition; and (2) document the reasons for not making such acquisition from a small business.States that an individual making a covered acquisition of less than $2,500 need not obtain individual price information for such goods or services, but allows the individual to take certain other factors into consideration, such as whether the market for such goods or services is highly competitive and whether such goods or services are readily available. Allows an individual to make a covered acquisition of more than $2,500 but less than $25,000 only if the individual obtains pricing information from not less than two small businesses that deal in such goods or services (provides pricing information sources). Allows an individual to make a covered acquisition of more than $25,000 only if the individual: (1) advertises the proposed acquisition by electronic media not fewer than 12 days before; (2) considers all price quotations received in a timely manner; and (3) solicits price quotations from at least three small businesses that deal in such goods or services, requiring at least one of such businesses to include a small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, or veterans.Requires each Federal agency to: (1) maintain a comprehensive source list of small businesses that are vendors of goods or services likely to be acquired by that agency; and (2) publish annually in the Federal Register, and transmit to the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, information regarding acquisitions made under this Act.(Sec. 3) Requires the Comptroller General to: (1) conduct an audit of the ten largest Federal agencies making covered acquisitions; and (2) report to the congressional small business committees on audit results and compliance with this act.(Sec. 4) Amends provisions concerning participation by small businesses in the performance of contracts let by Federal agencies to mandate that the failure of a prime contractor to make timely payment to a small business subcontractor shall be a material breach of the contract with the Federal agency, allowing the Federal agency to withhold from the prime contractor any amounts that the prime contractor owes to the subcontractor, and to pay such amounts directly to the subcontractor.(Sec. 5) Requires each subcontracting plan under such contracts to include: (1) a certification that the offeror or bidder will acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials to obtain the performance of construction work from subcontractors named in the bid or proposal and in the amount and quality used in preparing the bid or proposal, unless the subcontractor is no longer in business or can no longer meet the quality, quantity, or delivery date; and (2) assurances that the offeror or bidder will provide information concerning subcontracting opportunities and related information on an appropriate Internet site accessible to small businesses."
