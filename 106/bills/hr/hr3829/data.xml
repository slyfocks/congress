FECA Reform Act of 2000 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury, upon written request, to disclose to the Department of Labor current retirement income and tax return information only for purposes of, and to the extent necessary for, the administration of Federal workers' compensation law.Amends Federal workers' compensation law to authorize the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) to require a totally disabled employee to report his or her earnings from employment or self-employment. Requires the inclusion of the value of housing, board, lodging, and other benefits which are part of such earnings. Forfeits any authorized disability compensation for employees not reporting such earnings.Considers refunds to the United States by an employing Federal agency from third person recoveries against an employee as employee compensation for purposes of authorized continuation of pay during a period of disability.Authorizes the conversion upon a conditional date of basic compensation for total or partial disability to an annuity.

Prohibits benefits from being paid for wage loss during any period which the individual is confined in a penal institution or correctional facility after conviction for an offense constituting a felony or other crime. Requires the names and social security numbers of such individuals to be made available to the Secretary to enforce such prohibition.Authorizes an employee to use annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay for the first three days of a disability (during which period such employee is currently not entitled to compensation).Increases the monthly compensation authorized, in the case of an employee's death, with respect to a surviving spouse with at least one child and for children having no surviving spouse.
