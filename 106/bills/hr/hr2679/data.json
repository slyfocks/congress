Sets forth a specified percent of such funds for administrative expenses related to administering motor carrier safety programs and motor carrier safety research.(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to develop a long-term strategy (including an annual plan and schedule for achieving, at a minimum, specified goals) for improving commercial motor vehicle, operator, and carrier safety.(Sec. 103) Amends Federal aid highway law to provide, based on a specified formula pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act), for proportionate reductions in appropriated funds from the Highway Trust Fund to carry out the motor carrier safety grant program.(Sec. 104) Authorizes additional appropriations out of the Highway Trust Fund for the motor carrier safety grant program for FY 2001 through 2003.Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century to increase authorizations of appropriations for the motor carrier safety grant program for FY 2001 through 2003. Prohibits the Secretary from making such grants to a State unless the State enters into an agreement that provides that the total State expenditure for the development or implementation of programs for improving motor carrier safety and enforcement of U.S. orders on commercial motor vehicle safety, hazardous materials transportation safety, and compatible State regulations will be maintained at a level at least equal to FY 1997, 1998, and 1999 levels.Requires the Secretary to withhold amounts allocated for motor carrier safety from States that are not in compliance with certain commercial driver license requirements. Provides for the reallocation of such funds if a State is not in compliance with such requirements by June 30 of the fiscal year in which the funds are withheld.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to establish in the Administration a motor carrier safety advisory committee.Title II: Commercial Motor Vehicle and Driver Safety - Amends Federal transportation law to disqualify from operating a commercial motor vehicle for at least one year any individual: (1) committing a first violation of driving a commercial motor vehicle with a revoked, suspended, or canceled commercial driver's license; or (2) convicted of causing a fatality through negligent or criminal operation of a commercial motor vehicle. Disqualifies an individual from operating a commercial motor vehicle for life for committing more than one violation of operating such vehicle with a revoked, suspended, or canceled commercial driver's license or being convicted of more than one offense of causing a fatality through negligent or criminal operation of such vehicle.(Sec. 201) Requires the Secretary to disqualify an individual from operating a commercial motor vehicle on an emergency basis for up to 30 days if allowing such individual to continue to operate such vehicle would create an imminent hazard.Directs the Secretary to issue regulations disqualifying an individual from operating a commercial motor vehicle who has been convicted of serious offenses involving a noncommercial motor vehicle. Defines \"serious traffic violation\" to mean, among other things, driving a commercial motor vehicle when the individual: (1) has not obtained a commercial driver's license; (2) does not have in his or her possession a commercial driver's license unless the individual held a valid commercial driver's license on the date of the citation; and (3) has not meet certain minimum testing standards with respect to the class of vehicle the individual is operating or type of cargo the vehicle is carrying.(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary, in prescribing regulations on minimum standards for testing and ensuring the fitness of an individual operating a commercial motor vehicle, to include minimum testing standards for the operation of a school bus in a State that elects to issue a commercial driver's license school bus endorsement. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe different minimum testing standards for different classes of school buses.(Sec. 203) Requires a State, in order to avoid the withholding of its apportionment of Federal-aid highway funds, to comply with certain commercial driver's license requirements, including to: (1) notify State officials of the State in which an individual has committed a (non-parking) violation of the State's motor vehicle control traffic law and has a commercial driver's license that has been issued by another State; (2) record and make available to authorized persons and entities such violations (including those that involve a motor vehicle and a commercial motor vehicle) in the driving record of the individual who has a commercial driver's license; and (3) revoke, suspend, or cancel for a specified time the commercial driver's license of an individual who has been convicted of serious offenses involving a noncommercial motor vehicle.(Sec. 204) Requires the Secretary, if a State is not in substantial compliance with specified Federal commercial driver's license requirements, to: (1) issue an order declaring all such licenses issued by such State as invalid; and (2) prohibit such State from issuing any more commercial driver's licenses.(Sec. 205) Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century with respect to the nationwide toll-free telephone system for drivers of commercial motor vehicles and others to report violations of Federal motor carrier safety regulations. Requires such system to be staffed 24 hours a day seven days a week by individuals knowledgeable about Federal motor carrier safety regulations and procedures. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 206) Directs a State, before issuing an individual a motor vehicle operator's license, to request information on the individual's driving record from the National Driver Register and the commercial driver's license information system.(Sec. 207) Directs the Secretary to develop and implement appropriate staffing standards for Federal and State motor carrier safety inspectors in international border areas. Directs the Secretary to allocate five percent of specified funds for border commercial motor vehicle safety programs and enforcement activities and projects.(Sec. 208) Urges the Secretary to ensure that motor carriers operate safely by imposing civil penalties at a level calculated to ensure prompt and sustained compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial driver's license laws.(Sec. 209) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the causes of, and factors contributing to, crashes that involve commercial motor vehicles.
