  <summary>6/7/2000--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code to make it unlawful for any person engaged in a gambling business to knowingly use the Internet or any other interactive computer service (service) to: (1) place, receive, or otherwise make a bet or wager; or (2) send, receive, or invite information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager. Prescribes penalties.Grants the district courts original and exclusive jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of this Act and prescribes civil remedies. Provides enforcement authority for violations taking place on Indian lands.Exempts from liability under this Act any service provider who, after being properly notified by a Federal or State law enforcement agency that a particular online site of such provider is being used by another person to violate this Act, removes or disables access to such site. Requires a provider, in order to receive such immunity, to: (1) maintain an electronic or written policy that requires the provider to terminate the account of a violating subscriber following receipt of a notice of violation; and (2) not knowingly permit its service to be used for such prohibited purposes.Authorizes alternative injunctive relief against such a provider and/or persons who use such provider.Exempts providers from liability for content, furnished by another person, that advertises or promotes non-Internet gambling activities, unless the provider is engaged in the business of such gambling. Requires such providers, in order to receive such immunity, to maintain the termination policy and to not knowingly permit the use of their services for such activities as required under the exemption above. Requires the provider to take appropriate action after notice from a Federal or State law enforcement agency that the provider's service is being used for such prohibited purposes. Authorizes alternative injunctive relief against such a provider under certain limitations and considerations.Exempts a provider who takes any action to remove or disable access, in compliance with this Act, from liability for damages, penalty, or forfeiture. States that nothing in this Act shall otherwise require a provider: (1) to monitor material or use of its service; or (2) except as required by notice, to gain access to, remove, or disable access to material. Lists exceptions to the prohibitions under this Act, including for certain State and multi-State lotteries and authorized horse or dog racing or live jai alai. Specifies that the prohibitions of this Act do not apply to any otherwise lawful bet or wager, placed on a closed-loop subscriber based service or a private network, and lawfully received by a federally recognized Indian tribe, if permitted under and conducted in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, provided that each person, when placing, receiving, or otherwise making such a bet or wager, is physically located on Indian lands. Directs the Attorney General to submit to Congress: (1) an analysis of the problems associated with enforcing this Act; (2) recommendations for the best use of Department of Justice resources for enforcement; and (3) an estimate of the amount of activity and money being used to gamble on the Internet.</summary>
