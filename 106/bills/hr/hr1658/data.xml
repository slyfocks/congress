  <summary>3/27/2000--Passed Senate amended.
Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal criminal code (the code) to establish general rules relating to civil forfeiture proceedings.(Sec. 2) Sets forth notification requirements with respect to seized property and civil forfeiture proceedings, including: (1) a requirement that the notice the Government is required to send to interested parties in a nonjudicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute be sent to achieve proper notice as soon as practicable and within 60 days after the date of the seizure; and (2) required conditions for extending the notification period.Sets forth procedures for filing claims for seized property. Directs the Government, within 90 days after a claim has been filed, to file a complaint for forfeiture consistent with specified requirements or return the property pending the filing of a complaint (allows a court to extend the period for good cause shown or upon agreement of the parties). Provides that if the Government does not file such a complaint, return the property, or, before the time for filing a complaint has expired, obtain a criminal indictment containing an allegation that the property is subject to forfeiture and take the steps necessary to preserve its right to maintain custody of the property, the Government shall promptly release the property and may not take any further action to effect the civil forfeiture of such property.Authorizes the Government, in lieu of or in addition to filing a civil forfeiture complaint, to include a forfeiture allegation in a criminal indictment. Specifies that if criminal forfeiture is the only forfeiture proceeding commenced by the Government, the Government's right to continued possession of the property shall be governed by the applicable criminal forfeiture statute. Bars dismissal of a complaint on the ground that the Government did not have adequate evidence at the time the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the property.Allows any person claiming an interest in seized property, in any case in which the Government files a complaint for forfeiture, to file a claim asserting such person's interest, with an exception. Directs such person to file an answer to the Government's complaint within 20 days after the date of the filing of the claim.Authorizes the court, if a person with standing to contest the forfeiture of property is financially unable to obtain representation by counsel, to: (1) authorize counsel to represent that person with respect to the claim where the person is represented by counsel appointed in connection with a related criminal case; or (2) insure that the person is represented by a Legal Services Corporation (LSC) attorney, at the person's request, where the property subject to forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as a primary resident.Places the burden of proof, in an action brought under any civil forfeiture statute for the civil forfeiture of any property, on the Government to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is subject to forfeiture. Authorizes the Government to use evidence gathered after the filing of a complaint for forfeiture to establish that property is subject to forfeiture. Directs the Government, if its theory of forfeiture is that the property was used to commit or facilitate the commission of a criminal offense, or was involved in such commission, to establish that there was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.Declares that an innocent owner's interest in property shall not be forfeited under any civil forfeiture statute. Places on the claimant the burden of proving that the claimant is an innocent owner by a preponderance of the evidence.Specifies that an otherwise valid claim shall not be denied on the ground that the claimant gave nothing of value in exchange for the property if: (1) the property is the claimant's primary residence; (2) depriving the claimant of the property would deprive the claimant of the means to maintain reasonable shelter in the community; (3) the property is not, and is not traceable to, the proceeds of any criminal offense; and (4) the claimant acquired his or her interest in the property through marriage, divorce, or legal separation, or the claimant was the spouse or legal dependent of a person whose death resulted in the transfer of the property to the claimant through inheritance or probate. Directs the court to limit the value of any such real property interest for which innocent ownership is recognized to the value necessary to maintain reasonable shelter. Bars the assertion of an ownership interest in contraband or other property that it is illegal to possess.Sets forth provisions regarding partial interests in property subject to forfeiture by an innocent owner, motions to set aside forfeiture, and release of seized property.Authorizes a claimant to petition the court to determine whether a forfeiture was constitutionally excessive. Directs the court to compare the forfeiture to the gravity of the offense. Places upon the claimant the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence at a hearing conducted by the court without a jury, that the forfeiture is grossly disproportional to the offense upon the claimant. Directs the court to reduce or eliminate a forfeiture found to be grossly disproportional as necessary to avoid a violation of the Eighth Amendment.Authorizes the court to impose a civil fine of ten percent of the value of the forfeited property upon a claimant in any civil forfeiture proceeding in which the Government prevails if the court finds that the claimant's assertion of an interest in the property was frivolous. Specifies that such fine shall not be less than $250 nor greater than $5,000.(Sec. 3) Amends the Federal Tort Claims Act to authorize compensation for injury or loss of goods, merchandise, or other property while in the possession of any customs or other law officer if the claimant was not convicted of a crime for which the claimant's property interest was subject to criminal forfeiture and if other specified circumstances apply. Authorizes the Attorney General to settle, for up to $50,000 in any case, a claim for damage to, or loss of, privately owned property caused by an investigative or law enforcement officer who is employed by the Department of Justice acting within the scope of his or her employment, subject to specified limitations.(Sec. 4) Rewrites Federal judicial code provisions to provide that upon the entry of a judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seized or arrested under any provision of Federal law: (1) such property shall be returned forthwith to the claimant or his agent; and (2) if it appears that there was reasonable cause for the seizure or arrest, the court shall cause a proper certificate to be entered and neither the person who made the seizure or arrest nor the prosecutor shall be liable to suit or judgment on account of such suit or prosecution, nor shall the claimant be entitled to costs, except as follows. Makes the United States liable under specified circumstances, when the claimant substantially prevails, for: (1) reasonable attorney fees and costs reasonably incurred by the claimant; (2) post-judgment interest; and (3) specified interest and imputed amounts of interest in cases involving currency, other negotiable instruments, or the proceeds of an interlocutory sale. Specifies that the United States shall not be required to disgorge the value of any intangible benefits nor make any other payments to the claimant not specifically authorized by this Act.Sets forth provisions regarding situations involving multiple claims to the same property.

Requires the application for the restraining order to: (1) set forth the nature and circumstances of the foreign charges and the basis for belief that the person arrested or charged has property in the United States that would be subject to forfeiture; and (2) contain a statement that the restraining order is needed to preserve the availability of property for such time as is necessary to receive evidence from the foreign country or elsewhere in support of probable cause for the seizure of the property.Amends the CSA to provide for seizure by the Attorney General of property subject to forfeiture to the United States in the manner set forth in the code.(Sec. 6) Authorizes the use of forfeited property to pay restitution to any victim of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture, including, in the case of a money laundering offense, any offense constituting the underlying specified activity.(Sec. 7) Directs that all civil forfeitures of real property and interests in real property proceed as judicial forfeitures.

Directs the court, upon conviction, to order the forfeiture of the property in accordance with specified CSA procedures.(Sec. 17) Provides for judicial sanctions up to and including dismissal with prejudice of the claim of any claimant in a civil forfeiture case or any related criminal forfeiture case under CSA when the claimant refuses to provide certain financial records located in a foreign country when it is within the claimant's capacity to waive the claimant's rights under applicable financial secrecy laws or to obtain the records.(Sec. 18) Rewrites Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provisions regarding the bringing in and harboring of aliens to authorize the seizure and forfeiture of the gross proceeds of a violation and any property traceable to such conveyance or proceeds.
