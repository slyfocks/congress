Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to eliminate the Rule of 78s accounting method for calculating refunds of unearned interest on credit transactions consummated after September 30, 1999 (currently, September 30, 1993). Directs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue final regulations implementing this Act."
