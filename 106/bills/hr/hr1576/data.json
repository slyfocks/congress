Shields a consumer from liability for any unsolicited check unless the consumer actually receives and negotiates such check. Creates a rebuttable presumption that such unsolicited instrument was neither received nor negotiated by the consumer to whom it was issued. Prohibits information on any liability pertaining to such unsolicited instrument from being reported to or received by any consumer reporting agency."
