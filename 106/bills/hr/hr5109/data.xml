Authorizes the Department's Under Secretary for Health to modify any adjustment determination made by a facility director. Requires each director to report annually to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on staffing for covered positions at that facility.

Requires a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees on the feasibility and desirability of using a computer-based system in conducting such evaluations.(Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to contract with an appropriate entity to conduct a follow-up study on post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam veterans.

Directs the Secretary to limit program care and services to general medical and surgical services, and to require that such services be provided only upon preauthorization by the Secretary. Makes eligible for the program a veteran who: (1) is enrolled to receive medical services from a nearby Department outpatient clinic; (2) has received care within 24 months preceding the veteran's application for program enrollment (3) requires such care and services for a non-service-connected condition and could not receive such care and services from a Department clinic; and (4) elects to receive such care and services under an entitled health plan.
