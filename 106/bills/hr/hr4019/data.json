    "text": "Telecommunications Merger Review Act of 2000 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in any proceeding to approve an application to assign or transfer control of a telecommunications license, permit, or certificate, from: (1) denying such application unless such assignment will result in a violation of FCC rules and such violation cannot be cured by a conditional approval; or (2) conditioning such approval except to the extent necessary to ensure compliance with such rules. Requires all action on such applications to be completed within 90 days after FCC receipt, unless the applicant requests an extension. Provides a 60-day deadline with respect to FCC action on an application for the acquisition by one local exchange carrier or its affiliate of the securities or assets of another local exchange carrier in which the acquiring carrier does not, and after such acquisition will not, have ownership or control of more than two percent of the subscriber lines installed in the aggregate in the United States."
