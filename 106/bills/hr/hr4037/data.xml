Requires the FEC to publish, during each calendar quarter, a list of each waiver granted during the previous quarter.(Sec. 104) Prohibits fraudulent misrepresentation in solicitation of contributions for or on behalf of any candidate or political party; or knowing and willful participation in or conspiracy to participate in any plan, scheme, or design to violate this prohibition.(Sec. 105) Subjects to regulation under FECA: (1) as a contribution any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any clearly identified individual to seek nomination or election to Federal office; and (2) as an expenditure any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any clearly identified individual to seek such nomination or election. Applies this regulation to corporations and labor organizations.(Sec. 106) Permits the principal campaign committees of candidates for the House of Representatives or the Senate to file their reports on a monthly basis instead of quarterly or semiannually, as otherwise required. Requires monthly filers also to file: (1) a pre-primary election report (although the FEC may waive it if the primary occurs within the first 20 days of a month); and (2) (in lieu of monthly reports due in November and December of such year) pre-general election, post-general election, and year-end reports.(Sec. 107) Sets uniform 15-day deadlines for semiannual, year-end, and monthly reports.(Sec. 108) Requires electronic filings accessible by computers to be accessible by facsimile (FAX) machines or electronic mail in the case of any report required to be filed within 24 hours after the transaction reported has occurred.(Sec. 109) Deems the actual receipt of certain independent expenditure reports within 24 hours by the appropriate recipient to be the time of filing (thus requiring actual receipt of such reports within 24 hours).(Sec. 110) Requires certain multicandidate political action committees (PACs) to file monthly reports in presidential election years.(Sec. 111) Makes additional reporting requirements changes requiring: (1) the principal campaign committee of a candidate to provide appropriate notice, in writing, of any contribution of $1,000 or more received by any authorized committee of such candidate during the period which begins on the 20th day before an election and ends upon the closing of the polls (currently, received by any such authorized committee after the 20th day, but more than 48 hours before, any election); (2) such notification to be made within 24 (currently, 48) hours after the receipt of such contribution; (3) certain reports currently required to be filed cumulatively during the calendar year to which they relate, in the case of any such report which is the first report required to be filed after the date of an election, to include a statement of the total contributions received and expenditures made as of the election date; and (4) establishment of the status of election cycle reporting vs. calendar year reporting of certain expenditures and disbursements.Title II: Contributions and Expenditures - Repeals the current requirement that contributions to a candidate in a non-election year be considered as made during the election year (thus allowing an individual to make up to $25,000 in contributions during a non-election year as well as in an election year.)(Sec. 202) Revises the prohibition against direct or indirect campaign contributions by foreign nationals to specify donations and other disbursements as prohibited.Codifies applicable Federal regulations for the stated purpose of prohibiting use of foreign funds by PACs and for protecting the equal participation of eligible voters in campaigns and elections for Federal office.(Sec. 203) Excludes from the meaning of contribution any lines of credit obtained by candidates (including brokerage accounts, credit cards, and home equity lines of credit) if they constitute commercially reasonable loans.(Sec. 204) Prohibits the separate segregated political fund established by a corporation, labor organization, or other specified entity from causing another person to make a contribution or expenditure by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal.(Sec. 205) Repeals the requirement that the annual estimate by the Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. voting age population specify such population by congressional district.
