Emerging Missile Threats Assessment and Contingency Planning Act - Directs the President: (1) to transmit to Congress a current assessment of the missile threat posed to the United States by North Korea, such assessment to include the most recent North Korea missile development and testing; (2) to include with such assessment a certification as to whether the United States will be able to defend itself against a North Korea missile attack during 2000, whether an initial national missile defense system, if deployed by 2005, will be capable of defeating expected missile threats from North Korea and other missile technology recipient states, and the earliest date by which the United States could deploy an effective national missile defense; and (3) if unable to make a positive certification, to report to Congress on missile defense options to ensure adequate protection.</summary>
