  <summary>3/25/1999--Introduced.
Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge Protection Act of 1999 - Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from implementing any agreement entered into before this Act's enactment date that would have the effect of allowing expansion of the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport beyond the capacity of that airport on that enactment date. Gives no force or effect to the environmental impact statement prepared by the Department of Transportation and the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport Commission with respect to the expansion of the Airport, dated May 1998. Requires the preparation of a new environmental impact statement with respect to the expansion of such airport in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 before the date on which construction is begun to expand that airport, that: (1) fully determines and describes the impacts on protected species of fish and wildlife that inhabit or use the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge of increases in overflights of the refuge resulting from the expansion; and (2) includes a determination of whether consultation is required under Endangered Species Act of 1973 with respect to that expansion. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress regarding whether the activities associated with the expansion of such airport or additional overflights of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge by air traffic using that airport may constitute a taking of an endangered species or threatened species prohibited by the Endangered Species Act of 1973.</summary>
