    "text": "Civil Aviation Research and Development Authorization Act of 1999 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize FY 2000 and 2001 appropriations for certain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) research and development (R&D) programs. Requires the Department of Transportation's (DOT) annual budget request for the FAA to identify all of the activities carried out by it within the categories of basic research, applied research, and development, as classified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11. (Sec. 4) Requires the FAA's national aviation research plan to include, among other things, a highlight of the R&D technology transfer activities that promote technology sharing among government, industry, and academia through the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. (Sec. 5) Directs the Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the FAA to submit jointly to Congress an integrated civil aviation safety R&D plan. (Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to make available through the FAA Internet home page abstracts relating to all research grants and awards made with funds authorized by this Act, except any material whose release is prohibited by law or regulation. (Sec. 7) Requires the Administrator of the FAA to conduct research to develop technologies and analyze information to predict the effects of aircraft design, maintenance, testing, wear, and fatigue on nonstructural aircraft systems. (Sec. 8) Directs the Administrator of the FAA to exclude from consideration for a FAA grant any person (except certain members of a recipient class) who received grant funds from a Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award process. (Sec. 9) Prohibits an entity from spending funds appropriated under this Act unless it agrees to comply with the Buy American Act. Declares that it is the sense of Congress that entities receiving financial assistance under this Act should spend the assistance to purchase only American-made equipment or products. Requires the Administrator of the FAA to provide each recipient of such assistance notice of such Buy American requirements. (Sec. 11) Prohibits the use of funds for contracts with persons falsely labeling products as made in America. (Sec. 12) Encourages the FAA to conduct research on the laser visual guidance landing system."
