Presidential Debate Reform Act - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to direct the President to establish a Presidential Debate Commission (Commission) six months before each general election for the offices of President and Vice President beginning with the general election in 2000. Directs the Commission to establish: (1) one preliminary debate; (2) not more than two vice presidential debates; and (3) not fewer than two nor more than four presidential debates. Authorizes appropriations. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the amount of Federal payments for a party's nominating convention for the following general election if the party's nominee for President or Vice President does not certify to the Commission that the nominee will participate in all applicable Commission debates (other than a preliminary debate).</summary>
