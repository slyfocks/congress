  <summary>3/22/1999--Introduced.
Employee Pension Portability and Accountability Act of 1999 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, with respect to retirement savings, to: (1) provide for an exclusion from an employee's gross income of payroll deduction contributions to individual retirement accounts (IRAs); (2) require an employer, upon request from an employee, to withhold retirement savings from wages; (3) provide a credit to eligible small employers for pension plan start-up costs; (4) permit an employer to establish a Secure Money Annuity or Retirement (SMART) Trust (as defined); (5) provide for faster vesting of employer matching contributions under a plan including an accrued benefit derived from such contributions; (6) require spousal pension right-to- know provisions; (7) set forth various nondiscrimination rules for qualified cash or deferred arrangements and matching contributions. (8) require one-percent employer contributions under the alternative method of meeting nondiscrimination requirements for IRC 401(k) plans; (9) redefine the term highly compensated employee; (10) revise multiemployer plan provisions with respect to the special limitation rule, the exemption for survivor and disability benefits, the full funding limitation, valuation, and partial termination rules; (11) allow rollovers from and to IRC section 403(b) plans; (12) set forth requirements relating to rollover contributions from deferred compensation plans of State and local governments; (13) permit specified rollovers and make other revisions concerning portability; (14) exclude from gross income, for certain IRC purposes, amounts involved in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a defined benefit governmental plan, if such transfer is for purchase of service credit under such plan a specified type of repayment; (15) modify requirements for joint and survivor annuities to provide for an alternative joint and 75 percent survivor annuity payable while both the participant and the spouse are alive; (16) treat periods of family and medical leave, under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as hours of service for purposes of pension participation and vesting.</summary>
