  <summary>4/15/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the treatment of S corporations and to the tax exemption for farmers' cooperatives, to declare that cooperative marketing includes the value-added processing of the products of cooperative members and other producers through animals, that is, by: (1) feeding such products to cattle, hogs, fish, chickens, or other animals; and then (2) selling the animals (or animal products) which were fed such feed products. Authorizes a U.S. district court to issue a declaratory judgment relating to the initial or continuing qualification of a farmers' cooperative as tax-exempt.</summary>
