Authorizes a State regulatory authority to: (1) establish programs for monitoring the operating and efficiency performance of in-State cogeneration and small power production facilities in order to determine whether they meet Federal Energy Regulatory Commission standards; and (2) require that a contract entered into before the date of enactment of this Act be amended to conform to State requirements governing rates to retail electric consumers."
