  <summary>5/6/1999--Introduced.
Requires a 25 percent increase, for FY 2000 and thereafter, in the amount that would otherwise be allocated to a State for prevention and intervention related to school violence in a grant for juvenile delinquency-related programs and programs to improve the juvenile justice system under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, if the State has in effect a law which requires that: (1) any public or private school administrator or employee with reasonable cause to believe that a student is or has been in possession of a firearm while in or on the premises of a school building in violation of Federal or State law immediately report the student's conduct to an appropriate law enforcement agency and to an appropriate juvenile department or State agency; (2) upon receipt of such report, the law enforcement agency immediately investigate to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the student, while in or on the premises of a public building, possessed a firearm in violation of Federal or State law; (3) if probable cause is determined, the student immediately be detained by the law enforcement agency for not more than 72 hours in an appropriate juvenile justice setting for psychological evaluation and a judicial determination of whether the student is a danger to himself or herself or to others, and a parent, guardian, or other adult with responsibility for the student be notified of that detention and its purposes; and (4) if the court determines that the student is a danger, the student be placed in an appropriate juvenile justice setting to receive professional psychological counseling. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
