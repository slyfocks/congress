Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to waive or vary such requirements, if a plan sponsor applies for such exemption, upon finding that compliance would: (1) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate; (2) not be administratively feasible; and (3) cause substantial business hardship to the sponsor.Establishes the Emergency Retiree Health Loan Guarantee Program and its Board. Authorizes the Program, through its Board, to guarantee loans provided by private banking and investment institutions to eligible plan sponsors to assist them in meeting obligations under this Act to restore benefits reduced after retirement. Requires such loan guarantees to be provided: (1) to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts pursuant to an amount authorized to be appropriated under this Act; (2) only in accordance with procedures established by the Board; (3) with specified limits on the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed and outstanding at any time, and on the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed with respect to a single eligible plan sponsor; and (4) with a termination date for the Board's authority to make commitments to guarantee any loan. Designates as an emergency requirement the amount made available to carry out the Program.Provides that other claims are not affected, and other causes of action are not authorized, by this Act.Authorizes the Secretary to assess civil penalties for violations of this Act."
