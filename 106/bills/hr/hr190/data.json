Requires each financial institution to prepare a public description of its lending and related programs designed to enhance the availability of community credit, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Amends the Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Fair Housing Act to prohibit: (1) creditor discrimination on the basis of the racial or ethnic characteristics of the applicant's surrounding neighborhood; (2) the Attorney General from initiating a civil enforcement action pursuant to the Consumer Credit Protection Act except upon referral; and (3) the use of statistical data indicating a disparate impact on various classes of applicants of a creditor's credit decisions as evidence of violations of such Act(s) unless accompanied by additional evidence demonstrating actual discrimination and intent to discriminate."
