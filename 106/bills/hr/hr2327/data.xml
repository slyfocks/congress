  <summary>6/23/1999--Introduced.
Deficit Accountability Act of 1999 - Amends the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to provide that pay for Members of Congress may not be increased by any adjustment scheduled to take effect in a year immediately following a fiscal year in which a deficit in the Federal budget exists. Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to determine and report to Congress on whether the Federal budget was in deficit for such fiscal year. Declares that failure to make such a determination in timely fashion shall be treated as a determination that the Federal budget was in deficit for the fiscal year involved.</summary>
