Requires the Secretary to begin releasing such wolves on such land by the latest of: (1) the date that is three years after this Act's enactment date; (2) the date on which the Secretary has obtained such wolves; or (3) the date on which the Secretary has obtained such land for that release.Directs the Secretary to designate areas in New York as critical habitat of such wolf for purposes of such Act."
