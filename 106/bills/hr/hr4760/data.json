Requires such registry to be used to determine the association, if any, between the disabilities of such veterans and the exposure to such weather.Presumes cold-weather injuries in such veterans to be service-connected and therefore compensable through veterans' disability compensation.Directs the Secretary, within 90 days, to prescribe initial regulations on injuries determined to have a positive association with sustained exposure to cold weather."
