Sets forth regulatory schedule requirements.Amends OSHA to make it inapplicable to home office employment, with the following exceptions which relate to specified OSHA provisions. Requires employers to report work-related injuries and illnesses sustained by an employee engaged in home office employment. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) impose sanctions for a failure of an employer to report a work-related injury or illness sustained by an employee engaged in home office employment, subject to review of such sanctions; and (2) make available information and standards to employees and employers in the recognition, avoidance, and prevention of unsafe or unhealthful working conditions appropriate for home office employment."
