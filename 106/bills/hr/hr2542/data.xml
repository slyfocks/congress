  <summary>7/16/1999--Introduced.
Space Access Improvement Act of 1999 - Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to declare that the general welfare of the United States requires the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop innovative technologies that would reduce the costs of transporting payloads and personnel to and from space, while simultaneously increasing the reliability and safety of advanced space transportation systems.Declares that the general welfare requires the Government to: (1) aggressively fund the development of innovative propulsion systems, high-temperature thermal protection systems, integrated vehicle health monitoring systems, lightweight durable airframes, and simplified launch and processing operations; (2) maintain a concerted effort in the development and testing of new space transportation technologies while providing sufficient funding for basic scientific research that is necessary for the long-term, revolutionary advances that will drastically reduce the costs of space access; (3) enhance U.S. economic competitiveness by facilitating U.S. commercial sector access to space transportation technology, data, and facilities, within the constraints imposed by national security considerations; (4) enter into cooperative research and development agreements with U.S. academic and commercial sectors to advance space transportation research, developments, and operations; (5) minimize regulations that discourage academic and commercial sector involvement in the development of advanced space transportation technologies; (6) utilize expertise and products available within the United States prior to seeking availability from foreign nations (except in cases where such utilization would be inconsistent with U.S. public interests); (7) equitably promote engineering and science education related to space transportation technologies, within constraints of national security considerations, to as broad a range of individuals as possible; and (8) continue to closely protect the intellectual property rights associated with advancements in advanced space transportation systems to maintain U.S. competitiveness in the world.Amends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 1986, respecting space shuttle pricing policy, to find and declare that: (1) the Space Transportation System remains an important space launch system (currently, is the primary space launch system); and (2) the United States must be committed to further developing low-cost, frequent, and reliable access to space.</summary>
