  <summary>12/15/2000--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to declare that, in the case of mail matter (cooperative mailings) sent (or proposed to be sent) by or on behalf of an organization authorized to mail at non-profit postage rates, which also has a contractual or any other business relationship with an entity not so authorized, non-profit postage rates shall apply if those rates would apply in the case of identical mail matter sent by an authorized organization without such a relationship with an unauthorized organization.Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that nothing in this Act should be considered to alter the authority of the U.S. Postal Service to: (1) to apply regular postage rates, rather than non-profit rates, to specified other mail matter; or (2) enforce any criminal law within its jurisdiction.</summary>
