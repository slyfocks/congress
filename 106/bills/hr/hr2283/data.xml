  <summary>6/18/1999--Introduced.
Authorizes duty performed by a member of the reserves on an honor guard detail for the funeral of a veteran, and training for such duty, to be considered a period of drill or training in addition to training otherwise required. Provides one day credit for each day of such duty for purposes of eligibility for military retirement. States that a reserve member who is on active duty under a call or order for more than 180 days and who is retained on active duty solely to participate in such honor guard detail shall not be counted toward the active-duty end strength limitations for such military department for that fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary of the military department concerned to accept voluntary services to participate in such details. Includes within the authorized uses of funds appropriated for State National Guard activities the support of State law requirements relating to National Guard participation in funerals of veterans.</summary>
