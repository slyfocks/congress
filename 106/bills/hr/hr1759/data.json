Allows such conveyance only after the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has made specified certifications to the Secretary with respect to the appropriate environmental cleanup of such area. Designates such lands and the Columbia River corridor adjacent to such lands as the Hanford Reach National Salmon Preserve and Recreational Area. Directs the Department of Energy and the State of Washington to enter into a joint agreement with Benton, Franklin, and Grant Counties to establish the Hanford Reach Protection and Management Commission, which shall develop and implement a plan to manage the lands conveyed by the Secretary in order to protect and enhance plant, fish and wildlife, and cultural resources, as well as recreational access to, and other uses of, Hanford Reach (a specified stretch of the Columbia River)."
