  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
District of Columbia Prison Safety Act - Amends the District of Columbia Code, as amended by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to change from mandatory to discretionary the authority of the Bureau of Prisons to house specified numbers and percentages of District of Columbia felons in private contract facilities by certain dates. Changes the number of sentenced felons to be so housed by December 31, 1999, from 2,000 to up to 2,000 (thus allowing for the transfer of fewer than 2,000 sentenced felons to private contract facilities by that date). Changes the percentage of the sentenced felon population to be so housed by September 30, 2003, from 50 percent to up to 50 percent (thus allowing for the transfer of a lower percentage of the sentenced felon population to private contract facilities by that date).</summary>
