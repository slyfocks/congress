Changes the number of sentenced felons to be so housed by December 31, 1999, from 2,000 to up to 2,000 (thus allowing for the transfer of fewer than 2,000 sentenced felons to private contract facilities by that date). Changes the percentage of the sentenced felon population to be so housed by September 30, 2003, from 50 percent to up to 50 percent (thus allowing for the transfer of a lower percentage of the sentenced felon population to private contract facilities by that date)."
