Extends pay-as-you-go and other specified provisions through FY 2009. Defines \"budget increase\" and \"budget decrease\" to mean, for purposes of pay-as-you-go provisions, an increase or decrease, respectively, in direct spending outlays or a decrease or increase, respectively, in receipts relative to the baseline. Requires a sequestration to offset the amount of any net budget (currently, deficit) increase caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation."
