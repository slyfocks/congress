Calls upon the administration strongly to support: (1) an independent process of data collection on human rights abuses in Sierra Leone, for use by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission when it has been established; and (2) any future initiatives of international accountability for Sierra Leone.Authorizes the President to provide assistance for the establishment and support of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to establish accountability for human rights abuses in Sierra Leone.Authorizes the Secretary of State, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, to collect human rights data with respect to Sierra Leone and assist the TRC.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 for: (1) establishment and support of the TRC; and (2) human rights data collection.(Sec. 6) Directs the President to report to specified congressional committees information, including measurable, credible, and verifiable evidence, concerning: (1) the extent to which countries neighboring on Sierra Leone are involved in arms flows into that country; and (2) illicit sales of Sierra Leonean gold and diamonds through neighboring countries.Declares that, if such a report contains measurable, credible, or verifiable evidence that a country is involved in arms flows into Sierra Leone, or that a country is involved in illicit sales of Sierra Leonean gold or diamonds through that country, then the Secretary of State shall: (1) take all necessary steps to initiate diplomatic efforts to bring about the termination of such activities by the country; and (2) inform the country, if it has not ceased the proscribed activity within three months after initiation of such diplomatic efforts, that U.S. foreign assistance may be terminated or suspended if it does not cease such activity.Authorizes U.S. assistance to the Central Government of a neighboring country if such government: (1) provides demonstrated support for the peace process in Sierra Leone in accordance with the Lome Convention of July 7, 1999; and (2) does not provide training or other support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the former Sierra Leonean army (AFRC) forces, or any other forces proscribed under the Lome Convention.
