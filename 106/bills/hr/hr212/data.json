Prohibits the President from restricting or prohibiting any exports (including restricted commercial or Federal financing) of food, other agricultural products, including fertilizer, medicines, or medical supplies and equipment as part of any policy of existing or future unilateral economic sanctions imposed against a foreign government. Authorizes the President to waive such sanctions for one-year periods if it is determined to be in the national security interests of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report annually to the Congress on the economic impact of multilateral and unilateral sanctions by foreign governments on U.S. exports of agricultural commodities. Directs the Secretary to expand agricultural export assistance under U.S. market development, food assistance, or export promotion programs to offset projected losses of agricultural commodity markets from such sanctions."
