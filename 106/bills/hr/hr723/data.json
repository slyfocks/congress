Allows an annual enrollment fee (of not over $15) and deductibles. Mandates copayments not over $10 per prescription. Prohibits approval of an application under provisions of the Public Health Service Act relating to biological products or provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act relating to new drugs if the drug manufacturer submits with the application the results of research carried out by the National Institutes of Health, or under an agreement under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, until the manufacturer agrees to pay to the Secretary of Health and Human Services seven percent of the gross sales receipts."
