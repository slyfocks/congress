Requires the President to report to specified congressional committees if it is determined that such programs are not exempt from such sanctions.(Sec. 5) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to establish a Congressional Oversight Group for Agricultural Negotiations that shall provide oversight and guidance with respect to agricultural trade policy and negotiation of agricultural trade issues.(Sec. 6) Expresses the sense of Congress that a certain amendment made to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 was intended to allow the sale or barter of U.S. agricultural commodities included in U.S. food assistance only within the recipient country or countries adjacent to the recipient country, unless it: (1) is not practicable; and (2) will not disrupt commercial markets for the agricultural commodity involved.(Sec. 7) Directs the United States Trade Representative (USTR), not later than 30 days after the submission of the National Trade Estimate report, to identify those foreign countries that: (1) engage in unfair trade practices with respect to U.S. agricultural commodities, or unreasonably delay or preclude implementation of a report of a dispute panel of the World Trade Organization (WTO); or (2) are determined by the USTR to be priority foreign countries. Sets forth special rules with respect to such identification.Directs the USTR to report annually to specified congressional committees on actions taken under this Act to achieve fair and equitable market access for U.S. agricultural commodities.Authorizes the USTR with respect to those identified countries to: (1) take specified trade action; and (2) request that the secretary of Agriculture target the use of existing U.S. export programs that are administered within the Department of Agriculture to the commodity that is subject to the unfair trade practice by the priority foreign country.(Sec. 8) Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to declare that the Department of Agriculture shall be the lead agency for sanitary and phytosanitary issues that affect agricultural exports. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to identify sanitary and phytosanitary measures currently negatively affecting agricultural exports, by country and commodity, noting: (1) whether such measures are consistent with the WTO sanitary and phytosanitary agreement; and (2) whether issues arising from such measures are being addressed and resolved. Directs the Secretary to report the findings to Congress not later than July 31, 1999.</summary>
