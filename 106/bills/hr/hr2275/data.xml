  <summary>6/17/1999--Introduced.
Ensuring Physician Choice Act of 1999 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to require group health plans, if they provide for coverage of services only if such services are furnished exclusively through health care professionals who are members of a closed panel of health care professionals, to make available an option which provides for coverage of services regardless of whether or not the professionals are members of such a panel. Exempts from such requirement: (1) plans that maintain an alternative group health plan which offers such a coverage option; and (2) plans (other than ones under which all benefits consist of health insurance coverage) of small employers who employ an average of two to 25 employees on business days.</summary>
