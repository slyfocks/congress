Directs the Administrator, for each bundled contract, to determine: (1) the amount of savings and benefits achieved by bundling the contract requirements; and (2) whether such savings and benefits will continue if such contract remains bundled, and whether such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small businesses.Requires an annual report from the Administrator to the congressional small business committees on contract bundling."
