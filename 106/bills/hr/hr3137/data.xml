  <summary>10/25/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 to authorize the Administrator of General Services to provide, upon request, to each President-elect and each Vice-President-elect, for use in preparing for the assumption of official duties as President or Vice-President, payment of expenses during the transition for briefings, workshops, or other activities to acquaint key prospective presidential appointees with the types of problems and challenges that most typically confront new political appointees when they make the transition from campaign and other prior activities to assuming the responsibility for governance after inauguration. Provides for such activities to be conducted primarily for individuals the President-elect intends to nominate as department heads or appoint to key positions in the Executive Office of the President.</summary>
