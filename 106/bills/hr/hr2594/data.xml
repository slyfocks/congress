  <summary>7/22/1999--Introduced.
America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to States, State courts, local courts, units of local government, and Indian tribal governments, acting directly or through agreements with other public or nonprofit entities, for 25 programs that involve: (1) continuing judicial supervision, including periodic review at least every 45 days, over preliminarily qualified offenders with mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders who are charged with non-violent misdemeanors, for a period not to exceed one year; and (2) the integrated administration of services, which includes specialized training of law enforcement and judicial personnel to identify and address the unique needs of a mentally ill or mentally retarded offender, voluntary diversion into outpatient or inpatient mental health treatment that carries with it the possibility of prosecution of the original criminal charge if the mentally ill or mentally retarded defendant is noncompliant with program requirements, centralized case management involving the consolidation of all of a mentally ill or mentally retarded defendant's misdemeanor cases (including violations of misdemeanor probation) and the coordination of all treatment plans of mental health and social service providers, and life skills training. Defines "preliminarily qualified offender with mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders" to mean a person who: (1) previously or currently has been diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional as having a mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders or who manifests obvious signs of mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders during arrest or confinement or before any court; and (2) is deemed eligible for diversion by designated judges. Directs the Attorney General to issue regulations and guidelines necessary to carry out this Act, including the methodologies and outcome measures proposed for evaluating each applicant program. Sets forth provisions regarding application requirements, the Federal cost share (75 percent), geographic distribution of grants, reporting requirements, and technical assistance, training, and evaluation. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
