Directs the Secretary to: (1) issue written findings in response to the issues raised in the petition; and (2) report to Congress the results of the investigations, if any. Directs the Secretary to review the marketing practices of air carriers that may inhibit the availability of quality, affordable air transportation services to commercial service airports. Requires the Secretary, if it is determined that one or more marketing practices of air carriers inhibit such services, to issue regulations addressing such practices."
