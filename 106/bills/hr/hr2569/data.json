    "text": "Fair Energy Competition Act of 1999 - Amends the Federal Power Act (FPA) to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to calculate and publish a generation performance standard for oxides of nitrogen from covered electric generating units in designated regions. Sets forth implementation guidelines which take into account: (1) ozone episodes; (2) fine particulate matter; (3) carbon dioxide; and (4) mercury emission reductions.(Sec. 4) Instructs FERC to allocate allowances: (1) for each air pollutant for which a statutory tonnage cap has been established; and (2) each person who demonstrates achievement of an independently certified reduction in gross electric energy demand during a covered period. Provides for carryover and trading of allowances.Prescribes implementation guidelines, including: (1) a measurement and verification protocol; (2) compliance with allowance limits; and (3) excess emissions.(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a National Electric System Public Benefits Board, which shall establish the National Electric System Public Benefits Fund to provide matching funds to States to support programs relating to renewable energy sources, universal electric service, energy conservation, and other public purposes.(Sec. 6) Prescribes guidelines for funding, distribution, and wires charges.(Sec. 7) Prescribes a minimum schedule for the total amount of electricity sold by non-hydroelectric facilities and generated by renewable energy sources. Prescribes procedural guidelines for: (1) renewable energy credits; and (2) mandatory FERC sales of renewable energy credits.(Sec. 8) Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to require each retail electric supplier to make net metering service available upon request to a retail electric consumer served or solicited by such supplier.Prescribes guidelines governing: (1) rates and charges; (2) safety and performance standards; and (3) interconnection standards among on-site generating facilities, net metering systems, and local distribution systems.(Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a disclosure system to allow retail consumers knowledgeably to compare retail electric service offerings (including comparisons based on generation source portfolios, emissions data, and price terms); and (2) promulgate regulations accordingly. Requires certain seller disclosures to wholesale customers as well. Declares that failure of a retail company to provide accurate disclosure shall be treated as a deceptive act in commerce prohibited under the Federal Trade Commission Act.(Sec. 11) Declares that no electric utility shall be required after enactment of this Act to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electric energy from cogeneration and small power production facilities.(Sec. 12) Prohibits any person, except in accordance with State-prescribed verification procedures, from submitting or executing a change: (1) in the selection made by a retail electric supply customer (\"slamming\"); or (2) to the number of products or services offered (\"cramming\").(Sec. 13) Prescribes privacy guidelines governing consumer proprietary information."
