Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to contract for the emergency health care of such veterans in non-Department facilities. Includes such contracted emergency care within the definition of authorized Department medical services. Authorizes the reimbursement of enrolled veterans for expenses incurred in the treatment of any medical emergency which poses a serious threat to life or health. Directs the Secretary to require in such a contract that payment by the Secretary for treatment of enrolled veterans at the non-Department facility be made only after any payment that may be made with respect to such treatment: (1) under part A or B of the Medicare program (title XVIII of the Social Security Act); and (2) by a third-party insurance provider."
