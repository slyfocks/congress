Authorizes enforcement: (1) by denial or termination of authorization to handle, manage, treat, release, discharge, dispose, store, transport, remove, move, or deliver covered substances; (2) by any other means authorized by law; and (3) for entities receiving Federal financial assistance, through specified compliance provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
