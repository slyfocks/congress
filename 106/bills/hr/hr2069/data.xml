  <summary>6/8/1999--Introduced.
Medicare Clinical Practice Patterns Act of 1999 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish: (1) clinical profiles of the practice patterns of health care providers providing items and services under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to determine how their practice patterns compare to each other; and (2) a method for public dissemination of summary information on such profiles without identifying the patient involved. Permits the Secretary, for certain such items and services, to adjust the amount of Medicare payments made to health care providers to encourage their provision of services in a medically appropriate manner and to discourage significant deviations in underservice or in overservice from generally acceptable medical norms.</summary>
