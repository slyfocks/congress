  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994), with respect to funds received under basic grants to local educational agencies, to repeal requirements for: (1) determining the number of children aged five to 17 from families below the poverty line; and (2) biennial population updates on the number of such children. (Thus, allows certain counties flexibility in spending such funds.)</summary>
