States that such Reserve shall not be considered to be an SPR component. Conditions the Secretary's authority to sell SPR products upon a finding by the President that a severe energy supply interruption exists. Preconditions such finding upon a determination by the President that: (1) a dislocation in the heating oil market has resulted from such interruption; or (2) another circumstance constitutes a regional supply shortage of significant scope and duration and SPR sales would directly and significantly help reduce the adverse impact of such shortage.(Sec. 201) Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct a continuing evaluation of the residential price data supplied by the Energy Information Administration for the Northeast and for published crude oil prices; and (2) determine release procedures governing SPR petroleum distillate after consultation with the heating oil industry.Requires the Secretary to submit a plan for the Reserve to the President and Congress by a specified deadline.Mandates establishment of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve Account in the Treasury subsequent to the Secretary's decision to establish the Reserve.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2003.(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on: (1) the use of energy futures and options contracts to provide cost-effective protection from sudden price surges for heating oil for government entities, consumer cooperatives, and other organizations that purchase heating oil in bulk to market to end use Northeast consumers; and (2) how to most effectively inform such organizations about the risks of futures and options contracts.Title III: Marginal Well Purchases - Authorizes the Secretary to purchase oil from a marginal well at $15 per barrel, adjusted for inflation, from amounts authorized to operate the SPR whenever the price of oil decreases to less than that amount.Title IV: Federal Energy Management - Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to raise from $750,000 to $10 million the cancellation ceiling for certain Federal agency multiyear energy savings performance contracts requiring advance notice, before award, to certain congressional committees.Title V: Alaska State Jurisdiction Over Small Hydroelectric Projects - Amends the Federal Power Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to discontinue its licensing and regulatory authority over certain new, small (power production capacity of 5,000 kilowatts or less) qualifying hydroelectric project works in Alaska effective upon FERC certification that Alaska has a regulatory program in place for water-power development that: (1) protects certain public and environmental interests to the same extent provided by FERC and specified Federal law; (2) gives equal consideration to energy conservation, fish and wildlife protection, recreational opportunities, environmental quality, the interests of Alaska Natives, and beneficial public uses; and (3) has licensing requirements for construction, operation and maintenance of lights, signals, and fishways by a licensee at its own expense, operation of navigation facilities subject to Secretary of the Army regulations, and fish and wildlife protection and enhancement based upon Federal and State agency recommendations.(Sec. 501) Authorizes the licensee of a project works licensed before enactment of this Act to elect to subject such works to licensing and regulation by Alaska in accordance with this Act.Declares that, with respect to project works on an Indian reservation, a conservation system unit, or Federal public lands, a State license or exemption from license shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary having jurisdiction over such lands, and such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.Requires the State of Alaska to notify FERC within 30 days after making any significant modification to its regulatory program. Requires FERC to reassert its regulatory and licensing authority if Alaska has not complied with one or more requirements of this Act. Prescribes FERC compliance review procedures.Title VI: Weatherization, Summer Fill, Hydroelectric Licensing Procedures, and Inventory of Oil and Gas Reserves - Amends the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000 to repeal the requirement that as of FY 2001 funds appropriated for weatherization assistance grants be contingent upon a 25 percent cost share by qualified participants.(Sec. 601) Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to repeal the mandate that an average of at least 40 percent of funds provided in a State for weatherization be earmarked for weatherization materials. Raises the ceiling of permissible per dwelling weatherization expenditures from $1600 to $2500, adjusted annually according to a specified formula. Includes within such expenditures the cost of heating and cooling modifications and replacements.(Sec. 602) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy, upon request of the chief executive officer of a State, to provide information, technical assistance, and funding to: (1) develop consumer education and outreach programs to encourage consumers to fill their storage facilities for kerosene, propane, and heating oil during the summer months; (2) promote the use of budget contracts, price cap contracts, and fixed price contracts, and other advantageous financial arrangements; and (3) give preference to States that contribute public funds or leverage private funds to develop State summer fill and fuel budgeting programs.Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 603) Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to report to Congress on expedited hydroelectric licensing procedures.(Sec. 604) Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct and update regularly an inventory of all onshore Federal lands to identify: (1) U.S. Geological Survey reserve estimates of subterranean oil and gas resources; (2) restrictions or impediments to development of such resources; and (3) furnish such inventory data to certain congressional committees. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 605) Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to direct the Secretary of Energy (acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information Agency) to submit to Congress an annual Home Heating Readiness Report on the readiness of the natural gas, heating oil and propane industries to supply fuel under various weather conditions, including rapid decreases in temperature.Title VII: National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2000- National Oilheat Research Alliance Act of 2000 - Authorizes the oilheat industry to conduct a referendum through a qualified industry organization among retailers and wholesalers for the creation of a National Oilheat Research Alliance to develop programs concerning oilheat research and development, safety issues, consumer education, and training. Defines "oilheat industry" to include those persons involved in the production, transportation, and sale of oilheat, and those engaged in the manufacture and distribution of oilheat utilization equipment in the United States (but excluding the ultimate consumers of oilheat).(Sec. 705) Permits State industry trade association participation in such Alliance. Prescribes guidelines for Alliance membership and representation.(Sec. 707) Requires the Alliance to: (1) levy and collect annual assessments on the wholesale sale of No. 1 distillate and No. 2 dyed distillate; and (2) establish a program coordinating its operation with that of any similar State, local, or regional program.Prescribes allocation guidelines governing Alliance funds made available to a qualified State association. Conditions fund availability upon the Alliance's determination that the funds will be used to benefit the oilheat industry directly.(Sec. 708) Instructs the Secretary of Commerce, using only data provided by the Energy Information Administration and other public sources, to make available to Congress, the Alliance, the Secretary of Energy, and the public, an analysis of changes in oilheat prices relative to other energy sources. Requires such price analysis to compare indexed changes in consumer grade oilheat prices to a composite of indexed changes in: (1) residential electricity; (2) residential natural gas; and (3) propane on an annual national average basis.Restricts Alliance activities to research and development, training, and safety matters in any year in which the five-year average price composite index of consumer grade oilheat exceeds the five-year rolling average price composite index of residential electricity, residential natural gas, and propane in an amount greater than 10.1 percent.(Sec. 709) Empowers the Alliance to bring suit in Federal district court to compel compliance with any assessments it levies.(Sec. 711) Mandates that Alliance-funded consumer education activities include a statement that they were supported by the Alliance.(Sec. 712) Prohibits such consumer education activities from including: (1) a reference to a private brand name if such activities were undertaken with funds derived from Alliance assessments; (2) a false or unwarranted claim on behalf of oilheat or related products; or (3) a reference regarding the attributes or use of any competing product.
