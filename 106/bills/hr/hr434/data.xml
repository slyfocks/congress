Directs the President to monitor, review, and report to Congress annually on the progress of sub-Saharan countries to determine their current or potential eligibility under the requirements of this Act.(Sec. 112) Grants duty-free treatment, without any quantitative limitations, to textile and apparel articles imported from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, if such country: (1) adopts an efficient visa system, domestic laws, and enforcement procedures to prevent unlawful transshipment of such articles (preferential treatment claimed on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components) and the use of counterfeit documents; (2) enacts legislation or promulgates regulations that would permit U.S. Customs Service verification teams to have access necessary to investigate allegations of transshipment through such country; (3) agrees to report, at the request of the U.S. Customs Service, on the total exports from and imports into that country with respect to such articles; (4) will cooperate with the United States to prevent circumvention as provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing; (5) agrees to require all of its producers and exporters of such articles to maintain complete records of the production and the export of the articles for at least two years; and (6) agrees to report, at the request of the U.S. Customs Service, documentation establishing the country of origin of such articles as used in such country in implementing an effective visa system.Directs the Secretary of Commerce to monitor imports of a textile and apparel article from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country into the United States to determine if there has been a surge in such imports, and whether such article is being imported in such increased quantities as to cause serious damage (or threat of damage) to the domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article. Directs the President, if there is an affirmative determination, to suspend the duty-free treatment provided such article.Directs the President to eliminate the existing quotas on textile and apparel articles imported into the United States from: (1) Kenya within 30 days after it adopts an effective visa system to prevent unlawful transshipment of textile and apparel articles and the use of counterfeit documents relating to their import into the United States; and (2) Mauritius within 30 days after it adopts a visa system.(Sec. 113) Directs the President to deny trade benefits under this Act to any exporter that has engaged in transshipment with respect to textile or apparel products from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.(Sec. 116) Directs the President to develop, and report to Congress on, a plan for the purpose of negotiating and entering into one or more trade agreements with interested beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to increase trade and investment between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.(Sec. 117) Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to establishment of the position of Assistant United States Trade Representative for African Affairs within the Office of the United States Trade Representative for the purpose of directing and coordinating interagency activities on United States-Africa trade policy and investment matters.Subtitle C: Economic Development Related Issues - Expresses the sense of Congress with respect to making debt relief available to the world's poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and human rights, alleviates poverty, and combats terrorism and the spread of AIDS.(Sec. 122) Expresses the sense of Congress that the stated policy of the executive branch in the 1997 Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa initiative is a step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa and is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this Act.
