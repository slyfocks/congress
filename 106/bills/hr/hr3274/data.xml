Patients' Formulary Rights Act of 1999 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code to prohibit a group health plan, and the insurance issuer offering such coverage, from using a formulary (a plan which limits the particular drugs for which coverage will be available) unless the plan or issuer: (1) notifies participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees in advance about, and makes available to treating health care professionals under the plan, specified information concerning the formulary; (2) notifies such individuals of any changes in the formulary; and (3) when a drug is removed from the formulary, permits an individual to continue to have the drug prescribed for treatment of the same condition.Includes within required formulary information: (1) the extent of therapeutic substitution; (2) a complete list of all drugs included in the formulary; (3) information on access to nonformulary drugs; (4) whether or not, and to what extent, coverage will exist for nonformulary drugs; (5) copayments or other cost-sharing for formulary drugs; and (6) limits on coverage payments for outpatient formulary and nonformulary drugs.Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require its authorized health insurance issuers and any Medicare+Choice organization to comply with such notification requirements in the same manner that such requirements apply to health insurance coverage or issuers in connection with a group plan.Requires the coordination of notification and formulary requirements through an interagency memorandum of understanding among the Secretaries of Labor, the Treasury, and Health and Human Services.</summary>
