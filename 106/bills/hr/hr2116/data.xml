Prohibits a veteran receiving such care from being transferred from the providing facility without the consent of the veteran or his or her representative.Includes noninstitutional extended care services within the definition of "medical services" authorized to be provided to eligible veterans through the above date.Directs the Secretary to operate and maintain a program to provide the following extended care services to eligible veterans: (1) geriatric evaluation; (2) nursing home care, either in facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs or in community-based facilities; (3) domiciliary services; (4) adult day health care; (5) noninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care; and (6) respite care. Prohibits the Secretary from furnishing such services for a non-service-connected disability unless the veteran agrees to make a copayment for services of more than 21 days in a year. Requires the Secretary to establish a methodology for establishing the copayment amount. Establishes in the Treasury the Department of Veterans Affairs Extended Care Fund for deposits and disbursements to cover such care.Authorizes the Secretary to furnish adult day health care to veterans enrolled in the Department's annual patient enrollment system who would otherwise require nursing home care.Authorizes the Secretary to furnish respite care services through contract arrangements.Requires the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans' committees on the operation of this section.(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to carry out three pilot programs to determine the effectiveness of different models of all-inclusive care-delivery in reducing the use of hospital and nursing home care by frail, elderly veterans. Requires the Secretary, under one pilot program, to provide services to eligible veterans: (1) directly through Department facilities and personnel; (2) through a combination of services provided under contract with appropriate public and private entities and those provided through Department facilities and personnel; and (3) through a combination of services provided through cooperative arrangements with appropriate public and private entities and services provided through Department facilities and personnel. Terminates each pilot program three years after its commencement. Requires a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees.(Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a pilot program to determine the feasibility and practicability of enabling eligible veterans to secure needed assisted living services as an alternative to nursing home care. Requires such program to be carried out at a designated Department health care region selected by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary, under such program, to enter into contractual arrangements for the provision of up to six months of assisted living services for eligible veterans. Requires a program report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees. Terminates such program three years after its commencement.Subtitle B: Other Access-to-Care Matters - Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse for the reasonable value of emergency treatment furnished in a non-Department facility those veterans who are active Department health-care participants (enrolled in the annual patient enrollment system and recipients of Department hospital, nursing home, or domiciliary care under such system within the last 24-month period) and who are personally liable for such treatment. Provides reimbursement limitations. Provides an independent right of recovery for the United States when a third party subsequently makes a payment for the same treatment. Requires the veteran to notify the Secretary of any third party payment. Authorizes the Secretary to waive recovery of such payment in the best interests of the United States. Requires the Secretary to include in FY 2002 and 2003 budget justification materials a report on the implementation of the reimbursement program.(Sec. 112) Requires the Secretary to furnish hospital and medical services, and authorizes the Secretary to furnish nursing home care, to any veteran awarded a Purple Heart.(Sec. 113) Directs the Secretary of Defense to enter into an agreement with the Secretary for reimbursement to the Secretary for medical care provided by the Department to military retirees eligible for care under the TRICARE Program (a Department of Defense managed health care program). Provides agreement conditions and limitations. Requires such agreement to be entered into within nine months after enactment of this Act. Directs the Secretary of Defense to include in each future TRICARE contract provisions to implement such agreement.(Sec. 114) Removes certain restrictions on the authorized use of Department facilities to treat military personnel for an alcohol or drug dependence or abuse disability.(Sec. 115) Revises a program providing counseling and treatment for veterans who have experienced sexual trauma to: (1) extend such program through calendar year 2004; (2) require (currently authorizes) the Secretary to provide such care and services to those in need; and (3) ensure that information about such care and services is revised and updated and made available through appropriate means (requiring a report from the Secretary to the veterans' committees on implementation of such outreach efforts).Requires the Secretary to: (1) study, and report to the veterans' committees on, the possibility of extending eligibility for such care and services to former reserve personnel; and (2) report to such committees on implementation of the sexual trauma program. Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense to jointly report to the appropriate congressional committees describing the efforts of their respective departments to ensure that military personnel, upon separation, are provided appropriate and current information about such counseling and treatment programs, including eligibility requirements and application procedures.(Sec. 116) Directs the Secretary to carry out a program to enhance the provision of specialized mental health services to veterans, including programs relating to the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse disorders.
