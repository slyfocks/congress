Defines such pesticides as those registered in Canada for use on agricultural crops and registered in the United States for use on other food use crops. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to accept a written request from a Canadian registrant for same-use U.S. registration unless substantial evidence exists precluding such acceptance."
