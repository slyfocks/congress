(2) permit a SNF to waive a three year transition period and elect to have the amount of payment for all covered facility costs determined pursuant to the adjusted Federal per diem rate applicable to it;

and (2) sustainable growth rate with regard to publication and with regard to the data to be used in determining such updates.(Sec. 202) Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a process to use data collected by entities and certain organizations in determining the practice expense component for purposes of determining relative values for payment for physicians' services under the appropriate fee schedule under Medicare part B; and (2) include in the publication of the estimated and final updates a description of such process for the use of external data in making adjustments in relative value units and the extent to which the Secretary has used such external data in making such adjustments for each year.(Sec. 203) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the physician and non-physician clinical resources necessary to provide safe outpatient cancer therapy services and the appropriate payment rates for such services under the Medicare program.Subtitle B: Hospital Outpatient Services - Amends SSA title XVIII part B to revise requirements for the PPS for hospital OPD services to: (1) require the Secretary to provide for a specified outlier adjustment for covered OPD services, as well as transitional pass-through payments for additional costs of "innovative" medical devices, drugs, and biologicals, while ensuring budget neutrality; (3) include medical devices as covered OPD services; (4) allow the Secretary to elect to establish relative payment weights based on mean hospital costs for covered OPD services; (5) limit, generally, the variation of costs of covered OPD services classified within a group for purposes of comparable treatment with respect to the use of resources; (6) change the Secretary's optional periodic review of PPS components to a mandatory annual review; and (7) establish a transitional adjustment in the amount of PPS payment for covered OPD services to limit declining payments under Medicare for such services, with a special rule for small rural hospitals, without regard to budget neutrality.(Sec. 211) Directs the Secretary to: (1) study and report to Congress on the extent to which intravenous immune globulin could be delivered and reimbursed under Medicare outside of a hospital or physician's office; and (2) report to Congress on whether the PPS for Medicare-covered outpatient services should apply to specified rural hospitals, clinics, and services for which payment may be made under Medicare.(Sec. 213) Amends SSA title XVIII part B to delay application of the PPS for hospital outpatient department services to cancer center hospitals.(Sec. 214) Limits the outpatient hospital copayment amount for a procedure to the amount of the inpatient hospital deductible amount.
