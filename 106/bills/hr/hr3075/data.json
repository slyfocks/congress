(2) permit a SNF to waive a three year transition period and elect to have the amount of payment for all covered facility costs determined pursuant to the adjusted Federal per diem rate applicable to it; (3) exclude certain additional items and services from being covered facility items and services (thus providing for Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) pass-through payment for such items and services, including certain ambulance services and chemotherapy items) while ensuring budget neutrality for FY 2001; (4) apply to facilities participating in the Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration Project requirements for determining base payments on a per diem basis; (5) modify requirements for the first cost reporting period update that is used in determining facility specific per diem rates; and (6) establish a payment rule for certain qualified acute SNFs serving individuals who are immuno-compromised secondary to an infectious disease, with specific diagnosis.(Sec. 126) Directs the Secretary to assess the resource use of patients of SNFs serving such immuno-compromised individuals to determine whether or not any permanent adjustments are needed to take into account the resource uses and costs of these patients.(Sec. 127) Directs the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MEDPAC) to study and report to Congress on SNFs furnishing covered SNF services to determine the need for an additional payment amount under Medicare to take into account SNFs in Alaska and Hawaii.Subtitle D: Other - Makes various specified technical amendments to the Medicare rural hospital flexibility program under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) and to provisions on payment to hospitals for inpatient hospital services under Medicare part D (Miscellaneous), as well as to various specified miscellaneous provisions of BBA '97, such as provisions on payment for home hospice care based on location where care is furnished.Title II: Provisions Relating to Part B - Subtitle A: Adjustments to Physician Payment Updates - Amends SSA title XVIII part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) to modify provisions on: (1) payment for physicians' services with regard to updates to provide for new guidelines for determining updates for years beginning with 2000 and 2001;
