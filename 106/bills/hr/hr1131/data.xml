ATM Public Safety and Crime Control Act - Amends the Bank Protection Act of 1968 and the Federal Credit Union Act to require each Federal supervisory agency for depository institutions to prescribe regulations, pursuant to recommendations made by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), mandating lighting and surveillance camera quality sufficient to be used effectively as evidence in a criminal prosecution. Amends Federal law to instruct the FBI Director to: (1) periodically review standards and procedures in connection with enhanced surveillance equipment at depository institutions; (2) make technical recommendations regarding enhanced surveillance to the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration Board; and (3) furnish certain congressional committees with copies of such recommendations. Sets a deadline by which the Federal banking agencies and the National Credit Union Administration Board must prescribe final regulations for such enhanced security measures.</summary>
