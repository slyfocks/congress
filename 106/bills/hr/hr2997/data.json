Bases LEA eligibility for such grants on the same criteria as that for LEAs to receive State grants in participating States.Requires such LEAs or their schools to use grant funds for: (1) educational technology, including software and hardware; (2) professional development; (3) technical assistance; (4) teacher recruitment and retention; (5) parental involvement activities; or (6) academic enrichment programs.Requires SEAs to award grants on a competitive or formula basis. Limits to five percent that portion of a grant which may be used for State administrative costs.Requires grant program reports by SEAs, specially qualified LEAs, and the Secretary.Authorizes appropriations."
