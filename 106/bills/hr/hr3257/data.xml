  <summary>11/16/1999--Passed House amended.
State Flexibility Clarification Act - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require a congressional committee report on a public bill or joint resolution that includes a Federal intergovernmental mandate that reduces the Federal Government's responsibility to provide funding to State, local, or tribal governments under the then-existing program, to include in such report a statement of how the committee specifically intends the States to implement the reduction and to what extent the legislation provides additional flexibility, if any, to offset it.Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to include in the estimate statement required with respect to such legislation: (1) if no additional flexibility is provided in the legislation, a description of whether and how the States can offset the reduction under existing law; or (2) if additional flexibility is provided, whether the resulting savings would offset the reductions in that program, assuming the States fully implement such flexibility.</summary>
