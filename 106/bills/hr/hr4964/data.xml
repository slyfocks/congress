Establishes the Public Health Emergency Fund to support such activities.Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish reasonable capacities appropriate for national, State, and local public health systems and their work forces to detect and respond effectively to significant public health threats; (2) award grants to determine the extent to which States or local public health agencies can achieve such capacities; and (3) award grants to address core public health capacity needs.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2010 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for defending and combating public health threats of the 21st century.Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) an Antimicrobial Resistance Task Force to coordinate Federal programs relating to antimicrobial resistance; and (2) a joint interdepartmental working group on preparedness and readiness for the medical and public health effects of a bioterrorist attack. Requires: (1) research and development of new antimicrobial drugs and diagnostics; (2) educational programs for medical and health personnel in the use of antibiotics; and (3) grants to establish demonstration programs promoting the judicious use of antimicrobial drugs and the control of the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.</summary>
