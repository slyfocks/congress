(Current law allows personal representatives to select such allotments if, during January 1, 1969, and December 31, 1971, one of such events occurred with respect to the decedent.)Subjects a beneficiary's interest in a settlement trust and the distributions thereon to creditor action only to the extent that Settlement Common Stock and related distributions are subject to such action under the Act.Title II: National Leadership Symposium For American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Youth - Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Education for the Washington Workshops Foundation for administration of a national leadership symposium for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian youth on the traditions and values of American democracy.</summary>
