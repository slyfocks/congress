  <summary>5/23/2000--Introduced.
Child and Adult Care Food Program Integrity Act of 2000 - Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act with respect to management of the child and adult care food program (CACFP).(Sec. 2) Revises CACFP eligibility criteria for participating organizations to require that they have not been determined ineligible for participation in any other Federal program as a result of program requirement violations. Requires sponsoring organizations to: (1) employ an appropriate number of monitoring personnel to ensure effective oversight of the operations; and (2) have in effect a policy that restricts other employment by employees interfering with CACFP responsibilities. Requires private institutions that apply for initial participation in CACFP to be bonded, if required by State law.(Sec. 3) Revises provisions for CACFP institutional approval and applications. Requires the State agency to determine that the sponsoring organization is administratively capable of operating the program described in its application, and would fulfill an identified need under CACFP. Allows a State to limit the number of sponsoring organizations in a geographical area if a sufficient number are available and able to serve day care homes in that area. Sets forth requirements relating to: (1) site visits; (2) CACFP program information for parent's or guardians; and (3) allowable administrative expenses for sponsoring organizations.(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary to establish procedures for termination or suspension of participating organizations.(Sec. 5) Allows a State to recover certain disbursed funds upon determining that the institution has engaged in fraud or abuse with respect to CACFP or has submitted an invalid claim for reimbursement.Allows State agencies to withhold reimbursements temporarily without a hearing for up to 90 days under specified conditions.(Sec. 6) Prohibits sponsoring organizations from reserving for administrative expenses any more than 15 percent of the CACFP payment; but allows States to waive such limitation if the organization provides justification for exceeding such amount.(Sec. 7) Requires State agencies to limit the ability of family or group day care homes to transfer from one sponsoring organization to another more frequently than once a year. Authorizes State agencies to permit or require such homes to transfer from one sponsoring organization to another more frequently than once a year for good cause.(Sec. 8) Requires a State to return, and the Secretary to reallocate to other States on the basis of need, any audit funds allocated under CACFP that are not obligated by the State for that fiscal year.(Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to provide continuous training to State agencies, and ensure that it is provided to sponsoring organizations, in identifying and preventing fraud and abuse and in improving management of CACFP.</summary>
