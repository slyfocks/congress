  <summary>10/25/1999--Passed House amended.
Made in America Information Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce, upon a determination that there is sufficient manufacturer interest and that manufacturers will provide fees so the program will operate without Federal Government cost, to establish a three-year toll-free number pilot program solely to help inform consumers whether a product with a retail value of at least $250 is made in America. Requires the Secretary to contract for the establishment and operation of such pilot program. Requires consumers to be informed that registration does not mean that: (1) the product is endorsed or approved by the Government; (2) the Secretary has conducted any investigation to confirm that the product meets the definition of "American made" in this Act; or (3) the product contains 100 percent U.S. content. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to propose regulations to: (1) establish a voluntary product registration procedure; (2) establish and collect a fee to cover registration costs; (3) establish the pilot program; and (4) assess manufacturer interest in the program. Sets forth registration fee amount, crediting, and collection provisions. Imposes civil monetary and Federal procurement penalties for knowingly registering a product that is not American made.</summary>
