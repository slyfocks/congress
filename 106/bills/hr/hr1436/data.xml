  <summary>4/15/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) to require certain notices in the Federal Register to include identification of the specific industry or industries to which the OSHA standard, to be promulgated under the OSHA rule, will apply. Directs the Secretary of Labor to ensure that the OSHA standard, as applicable to each such industry, is based upon: (1) an assessment of the risks to workers in such industry from the hazard which is the subject of the standard; (2) the range of estimates and the best estimate of the quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits of the standard in each such industry; and (3) an analysis of the costs likely to occur in each such industry as a result of compliance with the standard. Authorizes the Secretary to determine such risks and benefits on information from similar industries, operations, or processes, to the extent that information is not available on the specific risks to workers in any such industry.</summary>
