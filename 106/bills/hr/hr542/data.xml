  <summary>2/3/1999--Introduced.
Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 to reduce from 18 to 14 the number of Trident ballistic missile submarines subject to statutory limitation on retirement or dismantlement. Expresses the sense of the Congress that, if the Secretary of the Navy should reduce the number of such operational submarines from the current 18 to 14, the amount otherwise programmed for national missile defense programs for any fiscal year after such reduction should be increased by the savings derived from such reduction.</summary>
