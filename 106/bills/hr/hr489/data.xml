TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Child Care and Development Services Title II: Strengthening the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act Title III: Crime Prevention Program America After School Act - Title I: Child Care and Development Services - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to authorize and to make appropriations for FY 2000 through 2004 for new and expanded programs for child care and development services, including direct services provided outside of normal school hours, to promote the health and academic achievement of school age children, and assist the children in avoiding high risk behaviors. (Sec. 104) Requires each State that receives a block grant under such Act to use certain reserved funds to make grants to elementary or secondary schools or community-based organizations to expand the availability and affordability of quality child care and development services, especially direct services provided outside of normal school hours (including before- and after-school care and weekend, holiday, and summer care) for school age children. Requires grant preference to entities that: (1) serve communities with a high rate of poverty and a high incidence of at-risk children; and (2) propose programs that make certain transportation services available to the children served. Requires the use of grant funds for direct services outside of normal school hours, related quality services, and indirect services. Title II: Strengthening the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act - Amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to require that discretionary grants be awarded to local educational agencies (LEAs) for supporting certain programs of public elementary schools or secondary schools, including middle schools, that serve communities with substantial needs for expanded learning opportunities for children and youth. (Sec. 201) Increases the maximum duration of such a grant from three to five years. (Sec. 202) Requires the LEA to demonstrate that it will provide specified portions of the annual costs of project-assisted activities from sources other than such grant funds. (Sec. 203) Requires the use of grant funds to establish or expand community learning centers that provide activities that offer expanded learning opportunities for children and youth in the community (such as activities conducted before or after school), and which may include any of the currently authorized activities. (Sec. 204) Authorizes continuation awards of FY 1998 grants. (Sec. 205) Extends the authorization of appropriations for such Act. Title III: Crime Prevention Program - Amends the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to establish the After School Crime Prevention program. Directs the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to make grants to public and private agencies to fund effective after school juvenile crime prevention programs. Requires grantees to make available non-Federal matching funds in percentages determined by the Administrator. Requires grant priority to programs that: (1) are targeted to high crime neighborhoods or at-risk juveniles; (2) operate during the period immediately following normal school hours; (3) provide educational or recreational activities designed to encourage law-abiding conduct, reduce the incidence of criminal activity, and teach juveniles alternatives to crime; and (4) coordinate with State or local juvenile crime control and juvenile offender accountability programs. (Sec. 301) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
