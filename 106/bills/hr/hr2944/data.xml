Directs FERC to encourage incentive transmission pricing policies for approved organizations.(Sec. 104) Grants the consent of Congress to compacts among the States to establish regional transmission siting agencies.(Sec. 105) Permits FERC to mandate that a transmitting utility expand or improve its facilities for electric energy transmission in interstate commerce, subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and all other applicable State and Federal laws.Title II: Electric Reliability - Grants FERC regulatory jurisdiction over the electric reliability organization (organized pursuant to this Act), all affiliated regional reliability entities, all system operators, and all users of the bulk-power system for purposes of enforcing compliance with this Act. Sets forth procedural guidelines for establishment of a FERC- approved electric reliability organization (ERO) whose function shall be to develop and enforce standards for an adequate level of reliability of the bulk-power system. Prescribes implementation guidelines.(Sec. 201) Requires the ERO to take all appropriate steps to gain recognition in Canada and Mexico. Requires the United States to use its best efforts to enter into an agreement with such countries to provide for effective compliance with organization standards.Mandates system operator membership in such electric reliability organization, and in the appropriate affiliated regional reliability entity.

Requires FERC to exempt any person or transaction from such access requirements if it finds that regulation of such person or transaction is irrelevant to the jurisdictional rates of a public utility or natural gas company.(Sec. 516) Retains the jurisdiction of FERC and State commissions to determine whether a public utility company or natural gas company may recover in rates certain costs of an associate company.(Sec. 517) Declares this Act inapplicable to: (1) the United States; (2) a State or its political subdivision; and (3) a foreign governmental authority not operating in the United States.(Sec. 519) Grants FERC certain FPA enforcement powers.(Sec. 522) Transfers from the Securities and Exchange Commission to FERC all books and records that relate primarily to the functions vested in FERC by this Act.(Sec. 524) Amends the FPA to repeal its conflict of jurisdiction guidelines.Subtitle C: Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 - Amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to declare that, upon enactment of this Act, no electric utility shall be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase or sell electric energy or capacity pursuant to PURPA provisions governing cogeneration and small power production.(Sec. 532) Directs FERC to promulgate and enforce regulations to assure that no utility shall be required to absorb the costs associated with electric energy or capacity purchases from a qualifying facility executed prior to enactment of this Act (thus assuring such utilities recovery of all costs associated with such purchases). Provides that such regulations shall be treated as a rule enforceable under the FPA.Subtitle D: Additional Provisions Promoting Competition - Permits acquisition of retail electric energy on an aggregate basis by a group of retail electric consumers, or any entity acting on behalf of such group, if the group is served by local distribution companies whose facilities are subject to open access.(Sec. 542) Requires a local distribution company to allow its retail electric consumers who are certain small-sized power generation facilities to interconnect with its facilities.Title VI: Federal Electric Utilities - Subtitle A: Tennessee Valley Authority - Amends the FPA to repeal: (1) hearing, notice and review procedures relating to interconnection or wheeling orders that result in electric power sales or delivery outside the Tennessee Valley Region; and (2) guidelines governing equitability within territory restricted electric systems (transmission within the Tennessee Valley Region).(Sec. 602) Amends the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 to repeal restrictions placed upon the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to sell or deliver power beyond the area for which it was the primary source of power on July 1, 1957.(Sec. 603) Specifies circumstances under which TVA may: (1) sell electric power at retail; and (2) sell excess electric power at wholesale for use outside the Tennessee Valley Region. (Sec. 605) Mandates that TVA and its distributors renegotiate existing long-term contracts with respect to: (1) remaining term; (2) length of termination notice; (3) amount of electric energy that distributors may purchase from non-TVA suppliers, including access to the TVA transmission system; and (4) stranded costs recovery.(Sec. 606) Subjects TVA transmission and local distribution of electric power to FPA jurisdiction to the same extent as a public utility transmission of electric power in interstate commerce is subject to such jurisdiction.

Bars TVA use of such recovered proceeds to pay for additions to TVA's generating capacity.Mandates that the annual TVA management report to Congress include: (1) long-range financial plans; (2) source of funds used for TVA capacity additions; and (3) reduction of publicly-held TVA debt.(Sec. 609) Subjects the TVA to Federal antitrust jurisdiction.Subtitle B: Bonneville Power Administration - Subjects to the regulatory purview of the FPA the Bonneville Transmission System (the System), including the transmission of electric energy and the provision of necessary associated services over such System.(Sec. 623) Prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of proposals initiated by the Bonneville Administrator (Administrator) to place a surcharge on transmission rates to meet certain statutory cost recovery requirements.(Sec. 624) Bars the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) from selling electric energy or capacity to any retail electric consumer that was not under contract for the purchase of electric energy on October 1, 1998.(Sec. 625) Amends the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act to restrict the acquisition of new major BPA generating resources to: (1) FERC determination of customer payment-in-full for such resources; and (2) BPA determination that no surcharge will be required in connection with such acquisition.(Sec. 626) Subjects the BPA to Federal antitrust jurisdiction.Subtitle C: Other Power Marketing Administrations - Mandates that rates and charges made by each Federal power marketing administration (PMA) shall be the lowest possible that will recover all costs incurred by the United States for the production of electric energy sold by such PMAs.
