Provides that payment of such amount shall be in full satisfaction of any claims that the Tribe may have against the United States with respect to such damages. States that such payment shall: (1) have the status of a judgment of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the purposes of the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act; (2) be made in accordance with that Act's requirements on the condition that after payment of attorney's fees and litigation expenses, of the remaining amount, not less than 30 percent shall be distributed on a per capita basis and not more than 70 percent shall be set aside and programmed to serve tribal needs; and (3) not be used to purchase land for the purpose of having such land taken into trust for the Tribe's benefit."
