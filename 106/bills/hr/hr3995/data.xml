District of Columbia Receivership Accountability Act of 2000 - Requires each court-appointed District of Columbia receiver who administers departments, offices, and agencies of the District of Columbia government to: (1) administer such entities through practices which promote the financial stability and management efficiency of the District government; (2) ensure that the costs incurred in the administration of such entities (including the receiver's personnel costs) are consistent with applicable regional and national standards; (3) administer the entities by applying generally accepted accounting principles and fiscal management practices; (4) consult with the Mayor and Chief Financial Officer of the District in preparing the entity's annual budget for a fiscal year; and (5) prepare and submit to the Mayor, for inclusion in the District's annual budget, estimates of the expenditures and appropriations necessary for the maintenance and operation of such entities for the year.Authorizes the Mayor and the D.C. Council to make revisions to such estimates if, under the terms of the receiver's appointment by the court involved, the Mayor and the Council are authorized to do so, or if the estimates were proposed by the District Housing Authority receiver appointed during 1995.Requires: (1) an independent auditor, selected jointly by the receiver involved and the Mayor, to conduct an annual fiscal, management, and program audit of each District department, agency, or office administered by a receiver (unless, under the terms of the receiver's appointment by the court involved, audits are conducted by an auditor selected jointly by the parties to the action under which the receiver was appointed or the receiver is the District Housing Authority receiver appointed during 1995); and (2) the receiver to carry out procurement on behalf of such entities by obtaining full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures, with the exception that alternative methods may be used under specified conditions.Applies, with respect to District receivers, provisions of the Anti-Deficiency Act which limit expenditure and obligation amounts.</summary>
