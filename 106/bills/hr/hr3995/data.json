Council to make revisions to such estimates if, under the terms of the receiver's appointment by the court involved, the Mayor and the Council are authorized to do so, or if the estimates were proposed by the District Housing Authority receiver appointed during 1995.Requires: (1) an independent auditor, selected jointly by the receiver involved and the Mayor, to conduct an annual fiscal, management, and program audit of each District department, agency, or office administered by a receiver (unless, under the terms of the receiver's appointment by the court involved, audits are conducted by an auditor selected jointly by the parties to the action under which the receiver was appointed or the receiver is the District Housing Authority receiver appointed during 1995); and (2) the receiver to carry out procurement on behalf of such entities by obtaining full and open competition through the use of competitive procedures, with the exception that alternative methods may be used under specified conditions.Applies, with respect to District receivers, provisions of the Anti-Deficiency Act which limit expenditure and obligation amounts."
