(Authorizes the Secretary to designate additional insurance lines.) (Sec. 5) Sets forth disclosure requirements for rejected insurance applicants. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to establish a task force on insurance agency appointments which shall: (1) review and recommend solutions to improve inner city and minority insurance agents' ability to market insurance products, including steps to increase minority appointments. (Sec. 9) Directs the Secretary to annually collect and make available to the public insurance data from each designated MSA. (Sec. 10) Sets forth civil and injunctive remedies for agent violations of this Act. (Sec. 11) Terminates this Act five years from its effective date (with a two-year discretionary extension). (Sec. 12) Directs the Secretary to conduct studies of: (1) insurance applicants; (2) insurer actions to meet needs of minority and low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, including small businesses; (3) disparate claim treatment; (4) territory rating; and (5) reinvestment requirements.</summary>
