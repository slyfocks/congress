Defines a \"publicly-held obligation\" as one subject to the public debt limit, except any obligation issued directly to certain Federal trust funds or Government accounts.Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm- Rudman-Hollings Act) to require, in any fiscal year when such obligations are reduced by an amount less than the amount of such surplus, the shortfall to be included in the calculation of the sequestration required to offset the deficit increase."
