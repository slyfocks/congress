  <summary>10/28/1999--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to require the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce the face amount of publicly-held obligations issued under public debt provisions and of those whose principal and interest are guaranteed by the U.S. Government (except guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary) by an amount not to exceed the amount of the social security trust funds surplus in the preceding fiscal year. Defines a "publicly-held obligation" as one subject to the public debt limit, except any obligation issued directly to certain Federal trust funds or Government accounts.Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm- Rudman-Hollings Act) to require, in any fiscal year when such obligations are reduced by an amount less than the amount of such surplus, the shortfall to be included in the calculation of the sequestration required to offset the deficit increase.</summary>
