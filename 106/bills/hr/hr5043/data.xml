  <summary>7/27/2000--Introduced.
Book Stamp Act - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a program to promote child literacy and improve children's access to books at home and in early learning and other child care programs, by making books available through early learning and other child care programs.Directs the Secretary to carry out such program by allotting grants to applicant State agencies on the basis of relative amounts received by States under specified provisions of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990.Requires State agencies to use such grants to enter into contracts with local child care resource and referral agencies to carry out program activities. Allows State agencies to reserve up to three percent of grant funds to support a public awareness campaign relating to program activities.Requires local agencies which receive such contracts to use grant funds to provide payments for eligible early learning program and other child care providers, on the basis of local needs, to enable the providers to make books available, to promote child literacy and improve children's access to books at home and in early learning and other child care programs.Amends Federal law relating to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to require USPS to establish special postage stamps for child literacy, at the regular first-class rate plus a differential amount. Makes patron use of such special-rate postage stamp voluntary. Requires the USPS to pay all of certain amounts raised by sales such stamp to HHS for child literacy promotion activities. Expresses the sense of Congress that nothing in this section should: (1) cause a net decrease in total funds received by HHS or any other Federal agency, component, or program; and (2) affect regular first-class or other regular postage rates.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
