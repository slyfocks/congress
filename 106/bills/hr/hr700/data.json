    "text": "Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 1999 - Amends Federal aviation law to prohibit: (1) an air carrier from using a single flight number to denote a flight that it knows will involve a change in aircraft between flight segments; (2) an air carrier from providing an explanation of the reason for the delay or cancellation of a flight, or diversion of a flight to another airport, that it knows or has reason to know is false or misleading; (3) an air carrier or airport from conducting, or having conducted, a security procedure at an airport in a manner that results in a child under two years of age being separated from the child's parent or guardian without the consent of the parent or guardian; (4) an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent from selling air transportation in the United States for a flight that bears a designator code of a carrier other than the carrier that will provide the air transportation unless they first inform the person purchasing the air transportation that the air carrier providing the air transportation will be a carrier other than the carrier whose designator code is used to identify the flight; and (5) an air carrier from prohibiting a person (including a governmental entity) that purchases air transportation from only using a portion of the air transportation purchased (including using the air transportation purchased only for one-way travel instead of round-trip travel), and from assessing an additional fee on or charge to such person or any ticket agent that sold the air transportation to such person. (Sec. 2) Requires an announcement by an air carrier of a delay or cancellation of a flight, or a diversion of a flight to an airport other than the airport at which the flight is scheduled to land, to include an explanation of the reason for such delay, cancellation, or diversion. Makes an air carrier liable to each aircraft passenger for an excessive departure or arrival delay of the aircraft. Requires an air carrier that cancels a flight on the date it is scheduled for reasons other than safety to provide each passenger air transportation in a timely manner to the destination for which such passenger purchased the air transportation and a refund of the amount paid for air transportation. Requires an air carrier that finds baggage or property that has on it the name of an individual to make a good faith effort to find and return it to the individual. Requires an air carrier, upon request of any person (including a governmental entity), to disclose the number or percentage of seats that the carrier intends to make available on a specific date for use by a person redeeming an award under a frequent flyer program on any air transportation route provided by the carrier. (Sec. 3) Sets forth penalties for violations committed under this Act. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study, and report the results to Congress, to determine if air carriers are providing, during changes of planes, a level of supervision of unaccompanied children under 12 years of age that is sufficient to ensure the safety of such children."
