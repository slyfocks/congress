  <summary>11/3/1999--Introduced.
College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 1999 - Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide for enhanced penalties for any offense involving fraud or misrepresentation in connection with obtaining or providing, or furnishing information to a consumer on, any scholarship, grant, loan, tuition, discount, award, or other financial assistance for financing an education at an institution of higher education, such that those penalties are comparable to the base offense level for misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a government agency.Excludes debts in connection with such fraud from permissible exemptions of property from estates in bankruptcy.Directs the Secretary of Education: (1) and the Attorney General, in conjunction with the FTC, to report jointly to Congress each year on fraud in the offering of financial assistance for financing an education at an institution of higher education; and (2) in conjunction with the FTC, to maintain a scholarship fraud awareness site on the Internet web site of the Department of Education.</summary>
