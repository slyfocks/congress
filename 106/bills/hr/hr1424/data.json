(Sec. 5) Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit the purchase, ownership, or possession of body armor by violent felons, with a procedure for the Secretary of the Treasury to grant an exception where a person's employment, livelihood, or safety is dependent on the ability to possess and use body armor. Grants a law enforcement officer immunity from liability for false arrest arising from the enforcement of this section unless the person has in his or her possession a certified copy of the permission granting the person relief from the prohibition. Sets penalties for violations of this prohibition. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the head of a Federal agency to donate body armor that is surplus property and in serviceable condition directly to any State or local law enforcement agency. Allows specified officials in the Treasury and Justice Departments to act as the head of a Federal agency."
