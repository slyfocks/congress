Limits the amount of Federal funds that may be made available to such an organization for construction of a particular rehabilitation project to 65 percent of the total rehabilitation costs, but not to exceed 100 percent of actual construction costs incurred, and makes the local organization responsible for resource rights costs and all Federal, State, and local permits.Authorizes the Secretary, acting through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, to provide technical assistance in planning, designing, and implementing rehabilitation projects, should an organization request such assistance.Prohibits any assistance authorized under this Act from being used to perform operation and maintenance activities.Outlines assistance application requirements. Directs the Secretary to establish a system of approving rehabilitation assistance requests from organizations equitably.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2005 to provide financial and technical assistance. Requires the Secretary to conduct an assessment of the rehabilitation needs of covered projects. Requires: (1) the Secretary to maintain a database to track the benefits derived from, and expenditures made to, rehabilitation projects and to report annually to Congress on the status of activities conducted; and (2) local organizations that received assistance to report to the Secretary on the status of rehabilitation efforts undertaken using financial assistance after the completion of the specific projects for which assistance was provided.Title II: Dam Safety - Directs the Secretary of the Army to: (1) establish an inventory of dams constructed by (and using funds made available through) the Works Progress Administration, the Works Projects Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps; and (2) assess the condition of such dams and their need for rehabilitation or modification. Requires within two years of the enactment of this Act a report to Congress containing such inventory and assessment.Requires the Secretary of the Army, if a dam presents an imminent and substantial risk to public safety, to take measures to prevent or mitigate against such risk, except for dams under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Limits the Federal share of the cost of assistance provided to carry out measures to prevent or mitigate such risk to 65 percent of such cost.Authorizes appropriations.
