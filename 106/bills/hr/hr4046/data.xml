  <summary>3/21/2000--Introduced.
Fisheries Recovery Act of 2000 - Amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) regarding avoiding and minimizing bycatch and bycatch mortality. Modifies the definition of "essential fish habitat" to include nonmanaged fish. Requires a fishery management plan to close an area to a gear or practice that may affect such habitat unless the Regional Fishery Management Council determines that closure is not necessary and the Secretary of Commerce finds that the gear or practice will have a minimal adverse impact on habitat and minimal bycatch. Requires a Federal agency to which the Secretary has recommended habitat conservation measures to ensure that its action is not likely to adversely modify or impair habitat. Requires that conservation organization representatives be included on Councils. Removes references to international agreements from provisions relating to rebuilding overfished fisheries. Directs the Secretary, during preparation of a highly migratory species plan or amendment, to take into account (currently, to minimize, to the extent practicable) any disadvantage to U.S. fishermen in relation to foreign competitors.Amends the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 to modify the composition of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.(Sec. 7) Amends the Magnuson Act to mandate observers on commercial fishing vessels to collect data necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery. Requires a permit and fees regarding: (1) a vessel fishing in the exclusive economic zone or special areas or for anadromous species of Continental Shelf fishery resources; (2) the operator of such a vessel; or (3) the first U.S. processor to receive the fish.(Sec. 8) Modifies: (1) the definition of "overfishing" and "overfished" to include jeopardizing the ecological integrity and sustainability of marine ecosystems; (2) conservation and management measure requirements; and (3) fishery management plan requirements to add ecosystem considerations. Requires each: (1) fishery management plan to have a fishery impact statement; and (2) Council established under the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas to prepare a Fisheries Ecosystem Plan for each major marine ecosystem in its jurisdiction.(Sec. 9) Modifies requirements regarding the contents of fishery management plans and rebuilding overfished fisheries.(Sec. 10) Defines "precautionary approach" as exercising additional caution in favor of conservation when information is absent, uncertain, unreliable, or inadequate. Applies that approach to conservation and management measures.(Sec. 11) Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Magnuson Act.</summary>
