Human Rights, Opportunity, Partnership, and Empowerment for Africa Act (or the Hope for Africa Act) - Declares the policy of Congress toward sub-Saharan African countries. Title I: Cancellation of Debt Owed By Sub-Saharan African Countries - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to direct the President to cancel all concessional and nonconcessional loans made, guarantees issued, or credits extended by the United States to sub-Saharan African countries. Directs the President to report annually to the appropriate congressional committees concerning the cancellation of debt.(Sec. 102) Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of State to notify foreign governments that have provided loans, guarantees, or credits to the government of a sub-Saharan African country that it is U.S. policy to forgive all such debts and that such foreign governments should do the same.(Sec. 104) Amends the International Financial Institutions Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Directors at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank) to use the U.S. vote to advocate that such financial institutions: (1) unconditionally cancel all debts owed by a sub-Saharan African country to such institution; (2) encourage each country benefitting from such debt cancellation to allocate 20 percent of the country's national budget (including savings from such debt cancellation) to basic services, as the country has committed to do under the United Nations 20- 20 Initiative; and (3) after canceling such debt, require that any future loans not be used to finance in whole or part the implementation of any agreement which requires the country to pay more than five percent of its annual export earnings toward the servicing of foreign loans. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report to specified congressional committees with respect to the response by foreign governments to the policies advocated by this section.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) report to Congress on the amount of debt owed to any U.S. person by any country in sub-Saharan Africa; and (2) acquire and cancel each debt obligation owed to each U.S. person.(Sec. 106) Amends the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1999 to include as an additional duty of the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission that it advise the Secretary of the Treasury and report to Congress on the viability and desirability of having each indebted sub-Saharan African country repay foreign loans in their currency.(Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary of State to encourage the government of each sub-Saharan African country to allocate 20 percent of its national budget (including the savings from cancellation of debt owed by it to the United States) to other foreign countries, to the IMF and the World Bank, and to U.S. persons for the provision of basic services to individuals in their respective country, as provided for in the United Nations 20-20 Initiative.(Sec. 108) Expresses the sense of Congress that, prior to the cancellation of debt owed by sub-Saharan African countries, each such country should not pay in any calendar year an aggregate amount greater than five percent of the export earnings of the country for the prior calendar year.Title II: Trade Provisions Relating to Sub-Saharan Africa - Directs the United States, pursuant to the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, to eliminate existing quotas on textile and apparel exports to the United States from Kenya and Mauritius not later than 30 days after each country demonstrates that it: (1) does not engage in significant violations of internationally recognized human rights; (2) provides for the enforcement of certain internationally recognized worker rights; and (3) takes adequate measures to prevent illegal transshipment of goods. Directs the President to continue the no quota policy for each of the other sub-Saharan African countries that are in compliance with such requirements.(Sec. 201) Provides that, when the quota for either Kenya or Mauritius is first eliminated, the quota for textile and apparel products from China for each calendar year shall be reduced by an amount equal to the volume of imports of all textile and apparel products from all sub-Saharan African countries into the United States in the preceding calendar year, plus five percent of that amount.Requires the Secretary of Labor to determine, and report annually to Congress on, whether or not each sub-Saharan African country is providing for effective enforcement of internationally recognized worker rights.Directs the President to report annually to Congress on the growth in textiles and apparel exports to the United States from countries in sub-Saharan Africa in order to inform U.S. consumers, workers, and textile manufacturers about the effects of the no quota policy.Directs the President to provide an additional benefit of 50 percent tariff reduction for any textile and apparel product of a sub-Saharan African country that meets the requirements (relating to human rights, workers rights, and illegal transshipments) and that is imported directly into the United States from such country if the business enterprise, or a subcontractor of the enterprise, producing the product is in compliance with specified conditions.Sets forth specified conditions for the import of textile and apparel goods into the United States, including such goods from a sub-Saharan African country. Sets forth penalties for violations committed under this Act.Directs the U.S. Customs Service to monitor and the Commissioner of Customs to report annually on measures taken by sub-Saharan African countries which export textiles or apparel goods to the United States to prevent unlawful transshipment of such goods and circumvention of this Act or any agreement regulating trade in such goods between such country and the United States.(Sec. 202) Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize the President to provide duty-free treatment for certain import-sensitive articles, or articles set forth in the product list of the Lome Treaty, that are the product of a beneficiary developing sub-Saharan African country and that are in compliance with certain human rights requirements with respect to such articles if the President determines that such articles are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from such countries.Sets forth certain rules of origin for purposes of duty-free treatment of products from beneficiary developing sub-Saharan African countries.Extends duty-free treatment to: (1) products from beneficiary developing sub-Saharan African countries through June 30, 2005; and (2) products of other beneficiary developing countries through June 30, 1999.(Sec. 203) Grants a U.S. citizen a cause of action in the U.S. district court to seek compliance of sub-Saharan African countries with the requirements of this Act.Title III: Development Assistance for sub-Saharan African Countries - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise congressional findings with respect to long-term development assistance for sub-Saharan Africa to declare that the HIV- AIDS epidemic, along with other conditions, have caused countless deaths and untold suffering among the people of sub-Saharan Africa.(Sec. 302) Directs the Agency for International Development (AID) to provide capacity building assistance through participatory planning to private and voluntary organizations that are involved in providing assistance for sub-Saharan Africa.(Sec. 303) Prohibits military assistance to sub-Saharan African countries.(Sec. 304) Revises critical sectoral priorities provisions to give priority to: (1) increasing food security by promoting agriculture policies in sub-Saharan African countries; (2) improving health conditions in such countries by emphasizing, among other things, HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment programs; (3) providing increased access to voluntary family planning services, including access to prenatal healthcare; (4) improving education and vocational education, with particular emphasis on primary education and vocational education for women; and (5) developing income-generating opportunities, including development of manufacturing and processing industries and microcredit projects.(Sec. 305) Increases the minimum amount of long-term development assistance that should be targeted to certain critical sectors with respect to sub-Saharan African countries.(Sec. 306) Directs the Administrator of AID to report semiannually to Congress on: (1) how, and to what extent, AID has consulted with nongovernmental organizations in sub-Saharan Africa regarding the use of long-term development assistance to sub-Saharan African countries; (2) the extent to which such assistance has been successful in capacity building among local nongovernmental organizations and in increasing food security and access to health and education services among the people of sub-Saharan Africa; and (3) how, and to what extent, such assistance has furthered the goals of sustainable economic and agricultural development, gender equity, environmental protection, and respect for workers' rights there.(Sec. 307) Authorizes appropriations for the Development Fund for Africa.Title IV: Sub-Saharan Africa Equity and Infrastructure Funds - Directs the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to initiate one or more equity funds in support of infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa, including basic health services (including AIDS prevention and treatment), hospitals, potable water, sanitation, schools, electrification of rural areas, and publicly-accessible transportation.Title V: Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import Bank Initiatives - Directs the Board of Directors of OPIC to establish and work with an advisory committee to assist it in developing and implementing policies, programs, and financial instruments with respect to sub-Saharan Africa, including with respect to equity and infrastructure funds established under this Act. Sets forth requirements with respect to the composition and administration of the advisory committee.(Sec. 502) Amends the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to revise provisions establishing an advisory committee to require such committee to assist the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States in developing, among other things, financial instruments with respect to sub-Saharan African countries.
