    "text": "Voluntary Basic Educational Skills Testing Act - Directs the Assistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement, before any funds are obligated for a fiscal year, to submit to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a spending plan for activities funded through the Office of Educational Research and Improvement for such year. (Sec. 3) Gives to the National Assessment Governing Board (established under the National Education Statistics Act of 1994) exclusive authority over all policies, direction, and guidelines for establishing and implementing voluntary national tests for fourth grade English reading and eighth grade mathematics. (Sec. 4) Requires such tests to be made available, upon request, to a State, local educational agency, or private or parochial school. Prohibits making the use of such tests a condition for receiving any Federal funds. (Sec. 5) Directs the Board to review the current national test development contract, and modify it as necessary, or terminate it and negotiate a new contract under the Board's exclusive control. Sets forth Board responsibilities with respect to development of, and content and standards for, such tests. (Sec. 6) Prohibits a State or local educational agency from requiring any private or parochial school student, or home-schooled individual, to take any test developed under this Act without the student's or individual's written consent. (Sec. 7) Amends the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 to: (1) revise requirements for appointment of Board members; and (2) provide that the Board, in its exercise of its functions, powers, and duties, shall be independent of the Secretary of Education and the other offices and officers of the Department of Education. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to appoint individuals to fill vacancies on the Board caused by expiration of member terms or creation of new membership positions under this Act."
