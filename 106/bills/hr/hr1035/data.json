Makes a public-use airport eligible for such assistance if it is located in an air quality nonattainment area. Directs the Secretary in selecting an applicant sponsor for a grant to give priority consideration to applicants that achieve the greatest air quality benefits measured by the amount of emission reduced per dollar of grant funds. Sets forth fund requirements. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot program. Authorizes appropriations."
