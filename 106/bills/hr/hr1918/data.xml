  <summary>5/25/1999--Introduced.
Criminal Welfare Prevention Act, Part II - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) require the Commissioner of Social Security to pay a State or local jail or correctional facility or public psychiatric institution (confinement entities) for monthly reports on the identities of inmates or patients whose benefits under SSA title II are determined by the Commissioner not to be payable as a result of such reports; (2) set such payments at $400 for reports furnished within 30 days after such confinement begins, or $200 for reports furnished within 90 days after such confinement begins, with a 50 percent reduction in the amount of such payments under SSA titles II and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) in cases involving a comparable payment under the former title with respect to the same inmate or patient; (3) exempt from the Privacy Act of 1974 any agreements with such confinement entities to supply such reports; (4) transfer from the social security trust funds any sums necessary to enable the Commissioner to make such payments; and (5) eliminate the SSA title II requirement that confinement stem only from a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year (thus denying OASDI benefits to inmates or patients confined for any criminal offense).</summary>
