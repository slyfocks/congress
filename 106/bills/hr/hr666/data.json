(Sec. 6) Mandates that activities funded under this Act be primarily focused upon materials that promote: (1) improved energy efficiency; (2) elimination or minimization of emissions of global climate change gases and contaminants; (3) minimization of industrial wastes and pollutants; and (4) use of recycled resources as primary materials for industrial production. Sets forth guidelines for major program elements and for participation by Federal departments and agencies. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory committee consisting of representatives of the private, academic, and public sectors to consult and coordinate with Federal entities in identifying and implementing the appropriate projects to be funded under this Act.
