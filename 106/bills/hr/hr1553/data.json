    "as": "Passed House amended", 
    "date": "1999-05-19", 
    "text": "National Weather Service and Related Agencies Authorization Act of 1999 - Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 and 2001 to the Secretary of Commerce to enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to carry out: (1) Operations, Research, and Facilities activities of the National Weather Service (NWS); (2) Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction activities of NWS; (3) Atmospheric Research Operations, Research, and Facilities environmental research and development activities of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OOAR); (4) Atmospheric Research Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction environmental research and development activities of OOAR; (5) Operations, Research, and Facilities environmental research and development and related activities of the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS); (6) Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction environmental research and development and related activities of NESDIS; and (7) Operations, Research, and Facilities environmental research and development and related activities required to meet recurring facilities operations costs associated with the David Skaggs Research Center in Boulder, Colorado. Revises requirements for the Secretary of Commerce's duties with respect to the NWS to include responsibilities for: (1) serving as the sole official source of weather and flood warnings; (2) issuing storm warnings; (3) collecting, exchanging, and distributing meteorological, hydrological, climatic, and oceanographic data and information;(4) preparing hydrometeorological guidance and core forecast information; and (5) issuing marine and aviation forecasts and warnings. Bars the NWS from providing or assisting other entities to provide a service that is currently provided or can be provided by commercial enterprise, unless: (1) the service provides vital weather warnings and forecasts for the protection of life and property of the general public; or (2) the U.S. Government is obligated to provide such service under international aviation agreements to provide meteorological services and exchange meteorological information. Directs the Secretary to report to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate detailing all NWS activities which do not conform to requirements of this Act and outlining a timetable for their termination. Expresses the sense of the Congress that NWS must fully take into account the dangerous and life threatening nature of weather patterns in Wind Zone IV, otherwise known as tornado alley, before making any determination to close any of its local weather service offices. Requires the NOAA Administrator to exclude from consideration for grant agreements made after FY 1999 under the activities for which funds are authorized under this Act, any person who received funds (other than due to membership in a class specified by law for which assistance is awarded to class members according to a formula) appropriated for a fiscal year after FY 1999 under a grant agreement from any Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award process. Makes such an exclusion effective for a period of five years after receipt of such Federal funds. Directs the Administrator to make available through NOAA's Internet home page the abstracts relating to all research grants and awards made with funds authorized by this Act. Prohibits any funds authorized pursuant to this Act from being expended by an entity unless such entity agrees, in expending such assistance, to comply with the Act of March 3, 1933, known as the Buy American Act. Expresses the sense of the Congress that entities receiving any equipment or products that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance provided under this Act should, in expending such assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products. Requires the Secretary to provide to each recipient of such assistance a notice describing such statement. Prohibits any person who has been finally determined by a court or Federal agency to have intentionally affixed a label bearing a \"Made in America\" inscription or any inscription with the same meaning to any product sold in or shipped to the United States that is not made in the United States, from receiving any contract or subcontract made with funds provided pursuant to this Act pursuant to debarment, suspension, and ineligibility procedures."
