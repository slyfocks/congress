(2) record any violation that has resulted in the disqualification, revocation, suspension, or cancellation of an individual's commercial driver's license; (3) notify State officials of the State in which an individual has committed a (non-parking) violation of a State or local motor vehicle control traffic law and has a commercial driver's license that has been issued by another State or is operating a commercial vehicle without a commercial driver's license and has a driver's license issued by another State; (4) prohibit the issuance of a special license or permit (including a provisional or temporary license) to an individual who holds a commercial driver's license that permits the individual to drive a commercial motor vehicle during a period in which the individual is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle or the individual's driver license is revoked, suspended, or canceled; (5) maintain, as part of its driver information system, a record of each (non-parking) violation of a State or local motor vehicle traffic control law while operating for each individual who holds a commercial driver's license; and (6) record and make available to authorized persons and entities such violations (including those that involve a motor vehicle and a commercial motor vehicle) in the driving record of the individual who has a commercial driver's license.(Sec. 203) Requires the Secretary, if a State is in substantial noncompliance with specified Federal commercial driver's license requirements, to prohibit such State from carrying out commercial driver licensing procedures and issuing any more commercial driver's licenses.(Sec. 204) Directs a State, before issuing or renewing an individual's motor vehicle operator's license, to request information on the individual's driving record from the National Driver Register and the commercial driver's license information system.(Sec. 205) Amends Federal transportation law to subject to specified civil penalties (in addition to any other penalties) motor carriers that fail to register their operations or that operate beyond the scope of their registrations.(Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary to suspend, amend, or revoke any part of the registration of a motor carrier, broker, or freight forwarder for failure to pay certain civil penalties imposed with respect to violation of certain Federal commercial motor vehicle safety regulations or failure to arrange and abide by an acceptable payment plan for such penalties.Prohibits an owner or operator of a commercial motor vehicle from operating in interstate commerce if such owner or operator fails to pay (or to arrange and abide by an acceptable plan for paying) a civil penalty for violation of certain Federal commercial motor vehicle safety regulations.(Sec. 207) Requires the Secretary to approve a State's plan to adopt and assume responsibility for enforcing Federal and State regulations on commercial motor vehicle safety if the Secretary decides the plan is adequate to promote specified objectives and, among other things, ensures that the State will cooperate in the enforcement of registration requirements and financial responsibility requirements with respect to motor carriers (including motor carriers for passengers and property), brokers, and freight forwarders.(Sec. 208) Redefines "imminent hazard", for which a commercial motor vehicle may be ordered out of service, to mean any condition of vehicle, employee, or commercial motor vehicle operations which substantially increases the likelihood of serious injury or death if not discontinued immediately.(Sec. 209) Excludes from the Board's jurisdiction over transportation of household goods any property moving from a factory or store unless the householder has purchased it with the intent to use in his or her dwelling, has requested the transportation, and has paid the carrier for it.Increases from $1,000 to $5,000 the threshold amount of a claim requiring binding arbitration of a dispute between a motor carrier, water carrier, or freight forwarder and a shipper of household goods.Directs the Comptroller General to study the effectiveness of DOT's enforcement of household goods consumer protection rules.(Sec. 210) Directs the Secretary to require, by regulation, each commercial motor vehicle owner and operator granted new operating authority to undergo a safety review.Directs the Secretary to initiate a rulemaking to establish minimum requirements for applicant motor carriers (including foreign motor carriers) seeking Federal interstate operating authority to ensure that they are knowledgeable about applicable Federal motor carrier safety standards.(Sec. 211) Directs the Secretary to complete a rulemaking to improve training and provide for the certification of motor carrier safety auditors, including private contractors, to conduct safety inspection audits and reviews.(Sec. 212) Directs the Secretary to complete DOT's rulemaking, Docket No. FHWA-99-5710, to amend Federal motor carrier safety regulations to determine which motor carriers operating commercial motor vehicles designed or used to transport between nine and 15 passengers (including the driver) for compensation shall be covered.(Sec. 213) Amends the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century with respect to the nationwide toll-free telephone system for drivers of commercial motor vehicles and others to report violations of Federal motor carrier safety regulations.
