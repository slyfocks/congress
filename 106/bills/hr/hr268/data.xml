  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Airport Community Representation Act - Amends Federal aviation law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to approve the application for an airport development project grant located within five miles of a State boundary only if: (1) a policymaking committee has been established consisting of a specified number of members from each State located within five miles of the airport and the State in which the airport is located; and (2) the sponsor has fully considered the findings of the committee with respect to the project. Authorizes the Secretary to approve an eligible agency's application to impose a passenger facility fee to finance an airport-related project located within five miles of a State boundary only if, among other things, the eligible agency has complied with the requirements of this Act to the same extent as an airport development project sponsor is required to comply.</summary>
