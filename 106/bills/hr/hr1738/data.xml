  <summary>5/6/1999--Introduced.
Amends Federal aviation law to require the Secretary of Transportation, after receiving a joint application from an air carrier and a community primarily served by a small hub airport or a nonhub airport for an exemption to provide nonstop regional jet air service that meets certain Federal noise limits between a small hub airport or nonhub airport and a high density airport, to grant the exemption, provided granting it would: (1) be in accordance with established principles of safety; or (2) not violate the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Authorizes the Secretary to grant an exemption for: (1) a period of not less than 12 months; (2) a minimum of two daily roundtrip flights; and (3) a maximum of four daily roundtrip flights.</summary>
