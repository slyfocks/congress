Prohibits any requesting official from delegating such authority, except due to disability. Requires the AG to notify a requesting official of his determination, including any modifications needed before approving the application. Authorizes the issuing judge to consider past activities of the target (as well as facts and circumstances relating to current and future activities of such target) in determining whether or not probable cause exists for issuance of the order.(Sec. 603) Provides the same requirements, prohibitions, and authorities as above for requests from such officials for a court order for a physical search of a target under the Act.(Sec. 604) Requires information acquired under the Act to be included in required semiannual reports from the AG to the intelligence committees concerning all electronic surveillance conducted by the United States.
