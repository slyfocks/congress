    "text": "Youth Gun Crime Enforcement Act of 1999 - Title I: Extending and Strengthening the Brady Law - Subtitle A: Extending the Brady Act to Gun Shows - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit any person from organizing, planning, promoting, or operating a gun show without: (1) registering with the Secretary of the Treasury and paying a registration fee; (2) notifying the Secretary, at least 30 days in advance, of the date, time, duration, and location of the show; (3) submitting to the Secretary, at least 72 hours in advance, an updated list of all show vendors planning to participate; (4) verifying the identity of each show vendor participating by examining a valid identification document containing a photograph of the vendor; (5) requiring each vendor to sign a ledger with identifying information and a notice advising the vendor of his or her obligations; (6) notifying each attendee of requirements under the Act; (7) submitting to the Secretary, at least five days after the end of the show, a copy of the ledger and notice; and (8) maintaining a copy of the records described above at the permanent place of business of the show promoter for such period of time and in such form as the Secretary shall require.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) responsibilities of transferors and transferees who are not licensees, including criminal background check requirements; (2) responsibilities of licensees who agree to assist such persons in firearm transfers; and (3) records of licensee transfers.Sets penalties for violations of this Act.Authorizes the Secretary to enter, during business hours, the place of business of any show promoter and any place where a show is held for purposes of examining required records and the inventory of licensees conducting business at the show, without a showing of reasonable cause or a warrant.Increases penalties for violations of criminal background check requirements.Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle B: Establishing a Mandatory Handgun Waiting Period and Giving Law Enforcement More Time to Complete Background Checks - Prohibits a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer from transferring a firearm to an unlicensed person unless specified requirements are met, including that: (1) before completion of the transfer, the licensee transmits notice of the proposed firearm transfer to the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the transferee; (2) the system provides the licensee with a unique identification number or five (currently, three) business days have elapsed since the licensee contacted the system and the system has not notified the licensee that the receipt of a firearm by such person would violate the Act; and (3) if the firearm is a handgun or semiautomatic assault weapon, not less than 72 hours have elapsed since the licensee contacted the system, or if the firearm is a handgun, the transferee has presented to the transferor a written statement, issued by the chief law enforcement officer of the transferee's place of residence during the 10-day period ending on the date of the most recent proposal of such transfer by the transferee, stating that the transferee requires access to a handgun because of a threat to the life of the transferee or of a member of the household of the transferee.Requires a chief law enforcement officer who accepts notice of a proposed firearm transfer to destroy any statement or other record containing information derived from the notice, unless such officer determines that the transfer would violate Federal, State, or local law.Directs the Secretary to: (1) promulgate regulations regarding the manner in which licensees shall transmit notice of a proposed transfer to such officer; and(2) exempt licensees from the notice requirement where the Secretary determines such notice does not further the purposes of this subtitle.Subtitle C: Keeping Guns Out Of the Hands of Dangerous Juvenile Offenders - Defines the term \"adjudicated delinquent\" to mean an adjudication of delinquency based upon a finding of the commission of an act by a person prior to his or her 18th birthday that, if committed by an adult, would be a serious drug offense or violent felony.Provides that for purposes of Federal firearms provisions, any State conviction or adjudication of delinquency which has been expunged or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored by the jurisdiction in which the conviction or adjudication of delinquency occurred shall nevertheless be considered a conviction or adjudication of delinquency unless: (1) the expunction, set aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights (expunction) is directed to a specific person; (2) the State authority granting the expunction has expressly determined that the circumstances regarding the conviction and the person's record and reputation are such that the person will not act in a manner dangerous to public safety; and (3) the expunction expressly authorizes the person to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms.Specifies that the requirement for an individualized restoration of rights shall apply whether or not, under State law, the person's civil rights were taken away by virtue of the conviction or adjudication.Prohibits the sale or other disposal of a firearm or ammunition to a person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person has been an adjudicated delinquent. Authorizes appropriations.Title II: Restricting Youth Access to Firearms - Prohibits the sale, delivery, or other transfer: (1) of a handgun, or ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun, to a person who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under age 21 (currently, such prohibition applies with respect to juveniles); or (2) of a semiautomatic assault weapon or a large capacity ammunition feeding device to persons under 21.Applies the exemption applicable with respect to possession of a handgun in defense against a home intrusion to persons under 21 (currently, juveniles).
