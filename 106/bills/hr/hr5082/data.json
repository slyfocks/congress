    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "2000-07-27", 
    "text": "Local Participation in Railroad Operations Act - Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit rail carriers from constructing, developing, or expanding railroad maintenance facilities, intermodal rail transfer facilities, railroad sidings, railroad bridges, railroad yards, or other railroad facilities unless the Surface Transportation Board determines that the rail carrier has provided affected local communities with notice and an opportunity to be heard with respect to such activities. Sets forth requirements with respect to such public meetings.Prohibits the Board from approving the consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control of a rail carrier by one or more rail carriers unless it has received assurances that the rail carriers have addressed adequately and will continue to address adequately problems identified with respect to the quality of life and safety of persons who live, work, or are for any other reason near railroad tracks.Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to publish in the Federal Register proposed regulations for reducing noise pollution generated from railroad operations and railroad facilities. Sets forth certain regulation requirements. Repeals a section of the Noise Control Act of 1972 regarding railroad noise emission standards upon the issuance of the final regulations under this Act."
