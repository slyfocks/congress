    "text": "Social Security On-line Privacy Protection Act of 1999 - Prohibits an interactive computer service from disclosing to a third party an individual's social security number or related personally identifiable information without the individual's prior informed written consent. Defines interactive computer service as one providing computer access to multiple users via modem or other means of telecommunication to the Internet or any other on-line network. Requires such service to permit an individual to revoke any consent at any time, upon which revocation such service shall cease disclosing such number or information to a third party. Gives the Federal Trade Commission enforcement authority under this Act."
