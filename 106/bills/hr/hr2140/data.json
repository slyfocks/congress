Prohibits such revised boundaries from taking place if Congress adopts a Joint Resolution disapproving the revision.Increases the total acreage limitation for the Area to 10,000 (currently, approximately 6,800).Requires any property acquired for the Area to be purchased from willing sellers. Repeals Federal provisions providing for exchange of Federal lands within the Area for non-Federal lands within its boundaries.Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with other entities (currently, Georgia and its political subdivisions) to assure standardized acquisition, planning, design, construction, and operation of the Area.Increases from $79.4 million to $115 million the cap on the authorization of appropriations for land acquisition for the Area. Authorizes the Secretary to accept the donation of funds and lands or interests in lands to carry out this Act.Requires the Secretary to submit: (1) the initial general management plan for the Area to the House Committee on Resources (currently, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs); and (2) within three years after funds are made available, a revision of such plan to specified congressional committees."
