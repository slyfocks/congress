Requires the USTR, in making the National Trade Estimate, to consider, among other things, any advice given by representatives of affected U.S. industries, including representatives of labor unions.Title II: Relief From Unfair Trade Practices Under the Trade Act of 1974 - Declares that, for purposes of trade relief action by the USTR, an act, policy, or practice of a foreign country is unreasonable and burdens or restricts U.S. commerce if it provides for an agreement, understanding, or informal arrangement between the foreign government and a foreign business enterprise that has the effect of restricting market access in the country for U.S. goods or services or diverting goods or services of that country or any other country to the United States.(Sec. 2103) Requires the USTR to report annually to Congress on all trade actions taken by the USTR with respect to countries that do not comply with trade agreements entered into with the United States.(Sec. 2104) Authorizes an interested person to request the USTR to undertake a review to determine whether a foreign country is in material compliance with the terms of a trade agreement with the United States.
