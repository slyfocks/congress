    "text": "Brevard County Beach Equity Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of the Army, in cooperation with interested non-Federal entities, to conduct a study to determine whether any erosion or property damage along the shoreline in Brevard County, Florida, is attributable to the Canaveral Harbor Project. Requires the Secretary to: (1) limit the scope of the study to a review of existing data, reports, and studies relevant to erosion in the County; (2) hire an independent coastal expert to review and report on such data, reports, and studies; and (3) select such expert from a list of experts approved by the Corps of Engineers, the Canaveral Port Authority, and the County Commission of the County.Requires the Secretary to: (1) take into account the effects of each previously implemented measure designed to mitigate erosion or property damage attributable to the Project, except those measures implemented under the Shoreline Protection Project; (2) determine whether any measures are necessary to prevent or mitigate erosion or property damage, or to correct or repair past erosion or property damage; and (3) plan, design, and implement such measures. Requires the Federal and non-federal share of the costs of implementing any measure to be the same as for such Project.Requires the Secretary: (1) if he or she carries out any renourishment of a shore or beach located within the area covered by the Shoreline Protection Project, to modify the Project cooperation agreement to increase the Federal share to reflect the increased construction and periodic renourishment costs incurred; and (2) based on any reallocation of such costs, to credit or reimburse each non-Federal interest for any excess funds it may have expended with respect to such Project.Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 to repeal the requirement for the reimbursement of the non-Federal interest for the Federal share of preconstruction planning and design costs for the project for shore protection for Broward County and Hillsboro Inlet, Florida if the work is compatible with and integral to such project.Authorizes use of up to $250,000 of funds made available for the operation or maintenance of the Canaveral Harbor Project to conduct the study. Provides for the costs of any mitigation measure carried out under this Act to be allocated to such Project as operation and maintenance costs."
