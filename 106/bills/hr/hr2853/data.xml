  <summary>9/14/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Federal judicial code to require the employer of a Federal grand or petit juror to pay to that juror, for each day during which such individual performs jury duty, a wage not less than the differential compensation less the aggregate amount of any fees and allowances paid to the juror for that day. Defines "differential compensation" to mean: (1) if that juror has a regular employment schedule with that employer, the wage or salary that the juror would have been paid for that day but for that juror's performance of jury duty; and (2) if that juror does not have a regular schedule with that employer, the average daily wage or salary of the juror during the seven-day period ending on the day before the juror first performed jury duty.Defines "employer" to include any public or private employer.Allows a person summoned for jury service to be excused upon a showing by his or her employer that payment of differential compensation would result in significant hardship to the employer.</summary>
