Federal Protective Service Reform Act of 2000 -Redesignates special policemen of the General Services Administration (GSA) as police officers.(Sec. 3) Empowers such police officers, while on duty, to: (1) carry firearms; (2) petition Federal courts for and execute arrest and search warrants; (3) make arrests without a warrant; and (4) conduct investigations, on and off the property, of offenses on such property. Authorizes the GSA Administrator to enter into agreements with State and local governments to obtain authority for police officers appointed under the Act to exercise, concurrently with State and local law enforcement authorities, such powers in areas adjacent to U.S. property under the charge and control of the Administrator.(Sec. 4) Increases the maximum penalty for violations of any rules or regulations with respect to Federal property.(Sec. 5) Empowers special agents with the same authority outside Federal property as police officers have.(Sec. 6) Directs the Administrator to establish the FPS as a separate operating service of GSA. Provides for the FPS to be headed by a Commissioner who: (1) shall be appointed by and report directly to the Administrator; and (2) has at least five years of professional law enforcement experience in a command or supervisory position. Requires the Commissioner to: (1) assist the Administrator; (2) serve as the U.S. law enforcement officer and security official with respect to the protection of Federal officers and employees in such property (other than buildings and areas that are secured by the United States Secret Service), except as otherwise prohibited by law; (3) render assistance to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies upon request; and (4) coordinate his or her activities with those of the Commissioner of the Public Buildings Service.(Sec. 7) Requires the pay and benefits for any FPS employee who maintains active law enforcement status to be determined in accordance with a pay and benefits package established by the Administrator that is equivalent to the pay scale and benefits package applicable to United States Capitol Police.(Sec. 8) Requires there to be at least 730 full-time police officers in the FPS one year after the enactment of this Act. Prohibits any reduction in such number of officers unless specifically authorized by law.Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the feasibility of merging all building security forces of the executive branch within and under the FPS's supervision.(Sec. 9) Directs the Commissioner to prescribe minimum standards of suitability for employment to be applied in the contracting of security personnel for Federal property.(Sec. 10) Authorizes appropriations from the Federal Buildings Fund.</summary>
