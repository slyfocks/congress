(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to allocate the amounts appropriated to carry out this Act equally among regional centers or area offices of the Bureau of the Census. (Sec. 6) Allows a grant to be used only to: (1) train volunteers to assist individuals to complete and return census questionnaires; (2) educate the public about the importance of participating in the 2000 census and the confidentiality that will be accorded to information collected; (3) recruit candidates to apply for census office and field enumerator positions; (4) sponsor community events to promote the 2000 census; (5) produce community-tailored promotional materials; or (6) rent space to provide any such training.
