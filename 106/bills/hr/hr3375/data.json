    "text": "Convicted Offender DNA Index System Support Act - Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to: (1) develop a plan to assist States in performing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analyses of DNA samples collected from convicted offenders, aimed at eliminating the backlog of convicted offender DNA samples awaiting analysis in State or local forensic laboratory storage in an efficient, expeditious manner that will provide for their entry into the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS); and (2) give preference in assistance to those States that have developed a comprehensive program for the DNA analysis of crime scene evidence in casework for which there are no suspects. Sets forth provisions regarding plan conditions and plan implementation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3) Directs the Attorney General to develop a plan to assist States in performing DNA analyses of crime scene evidence in casework for which there are no suspects aimed at eliminating the backlog of crime scene evidence awaiting DNA analysis in State or local forensic laboratory storage, including evidence that needs to be re-analyzed using upgraded methods, in an efficient, expeditious manner that will provide for the entry of those analyses into CODIS. Sets forth provisions regarding plan conditions and plan implementation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 4) Requires the FBI Director to develop a plan to effectively eliminate the backlog of crime scene evidence awaiting DNA analysis in forensic laboratory storage of the Bureau, including evidence that needs to be re-analyzed using upgraded methods, in an efficient, expeditious manner that will provide for the entry of those analyses into CODIS. Sets forth provisions regarding plan conditions and plan implementation. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 5) Requires the FBI Director to expand CODIS to include information on missing persons, including analyses of DNA samples voluntarily contributed from relatives of missing persons. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 6) Revises the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 to authorize the Director of the FBI to expand CODIS to include information on DNA identification records and analyses related to criminal offenses and acts of juvenile delinquency under Federal law, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the District of Columbia (DC) Code.Modifies the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to authorize the Director to establish an index of individuals convicted of criminal offenses or adjudicated delinquent for acts of juvenile delinquency, including specified qualifying offenses, and an index of analyses of DNA samples voluntarily contributed from relatives of missing persons. Directs that the index include only information on DNA identification records and DNA analyses that undergo semiannual external proficiency testing and that meet other specified requirements.Requires the Director to establish a list of qualifying offenses, including each criminal offense or act of juvenile delinquency under Federal law that constitutes a crime of violence (or, in the case of an act of juvenile delinquency, would, if committed by an adult, constitute a crime of violence), and each criminal offense under the DC Code that would, if committed in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, constitute a crime of violence.Requires: (1) the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to collect a DNA sample from each individual in the custody of the Bureau who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense, and to specify the time and manner of collection of DNA samples; and (2) the agency responsible for the supervision under Federal law of an individual on supervised release, parole, or probation to collect a DNA sample from each individual who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense, and to specify the time and manner of collection of DNA samples.Authorizes the Government of DC to: (1) identify one or more categories of individuals who are in the custody of, or under supervision by, DC as a result of a conviction of a qualifying offense, from whom DNA samples should be collected; and (2) collect a DNA sample from each such individual.Directs the Director of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for DC, or the Trustee appointed under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as appropriate, to collect a DNA sample from each individual under Agency or Trustee supervision who is on supervised release, parole, or probation and who has been convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for a qualifying offense, and to specify the time and manner of collection of DNA samples.Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) prescribe regulations that specify categories of conduct punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (qualifying military offenses) that are comparable to qualifying offenses, and sets forth standards and procedures for the analysis of DNA samples collected from individuals convicted of a qualifying military offense, their inclusion in an index, and the expungement of DNA identification records and such DNA analyses from the index in any circumstance in which the underlying conviction for the qualifying military offense has been reversed or the underlying record has been expunged for any other reason; and (2) specify the time and manner of collection of DNA samples.Sets criminal penalties for individuals from whom the collection of a DNA sample is required or authorized who fail to cooperate in the collection of that sample. Requires such cooperation as a condition of probation, supervised release, or release generally.Authorizes appropriations.Sets forth report and evaluation requirements."
