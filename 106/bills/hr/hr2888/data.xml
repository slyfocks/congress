  <summary>9/21/1999--Introduced.
Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 1999 - Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Education Assistance Act to revise and reauthorize title VII subtitle B, Education for Homeless Children and Youth.Prohibits States receiving such funds from segregating homeless children and youth solely on the basis of their homeless status (with an exception for separate schools for the homeless initiated before enactment of these amendments).Requires schools to enroll immediately any homeless child or youth seeking enrollment, even if the records (except immunization records) normally required for enrollment cannot be produced.Provides that the school of origin is the default interpretation of the best interest of the child regarding school placement, unless this is contrary to the wishes of parents or guardians.Requires LEAs that seek to receive such funds to conduct an assessment of the educational and related needs of homeless children and youth.Directs the Secretary of Education to disseminate nationwide a public notice of the educational rights of homeless children and youth.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
