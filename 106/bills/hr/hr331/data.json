    "text": "Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) to add a new title V (Public Funding for House of Representatives Elections) outlining the following: (1) qualifications for public financing; (2) limitations on contributions to qualifying House candidates prohibiting such a candidate from accepting contributions other than contributions from individuals that total not more than $100 per individual per election cycle, with an 80 percent in-State contribution requirement; (3) rules restricting public funding to specified purposes, such as buying broadcast time; (4) limitations on the maximum amount of public funding, which is set at $750,000 for qualifying House candidates; (5) various specified requirements pertaining to television debates and radio and television advertising; (6) reporting requirements for political committees and authorization for the filing of certain State reports in lieu of any required FECA report; (7) provisions regarding soft money of persons other than political parties; and (8) rules for contributions through intermediaries and conduits. Prohibits a national committee of a political party, including the national congressional campaign committees of a political party, and any officers or agents of such party committees from soliciting or receiving any contributions, donations, or transfers of funds, or spending any funds, not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act. Imposes similar restrictions generally with regard to any amount expended or disbursed by a State, district, or local committee of a political party for any activity which might affect the outcome of a Federal election. Provides that: (1) no national, State, district, or local committee of a political party shall solicit any funds for or make any donations to any organization that is exempt from Federal income taxation; and (2) no candidate for Federal office, individual holding Federal office, or any agent of such candidate or officeholder, may solicit or receive any funds in connection with any Federal election unless such funds are subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act."
