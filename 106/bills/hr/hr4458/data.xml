  <summary>5/15/2000--Introduced.
Repeals provisions authorizing the Secretary of Commerce, in conducting the decennial census of population, to obtain such other census information as necessary. Authorizes the Secretary, in connection with any such census, to request no information apart from what was asked on the short form used in the 2000 census. Requires the census question on ethnicity to be included as part of the question on race in the form of a single option designated as Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.</summary>
