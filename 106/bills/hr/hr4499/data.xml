  <summary>5/19/2000--Introduced.
Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to revise the definition of serious health condition to: (1) exclude from FMLA coverage a short-term illness, injury, impairment, or condition for which treatment and recovery are very brief; and (2) include a list of examples of types of illnesses, injuries, impairments, and physical or mental conditions to be covered under FMLA.Allows employers to require that intermittent leave be taken in increments of up to half a work day.Requires employees to: (1) request leave be designated as FMLA leave; (2) provide written application within five working days of providing notice to the employer for foreseeable leave; and (3) with respect to unforeseeable leave, to provide, at a minimum, verbal notification of the need for the leave not later than the time the leave commences, unless the employee is physically or mentally incapable of providing notice or submitting the application.Permits employers to require employees to choose between taking unpaid leave provided by the FMLA or paid absence under an employer's collective bargaining agreement or other sick leave, sick pay, or disability plan, program, or policy of the employer.Directs the Secretary of Labor to review all existing regulations for implementing FMLA, and to issue new regulations revised to reflect the amendments made by this Act.</summary>
