Declares that the value of such transferred vessels shall not be counted for the limitation on the aggregate value of excess defense articles that can be transferred to such a country in any fiscal year. Directs the Secretary, to the maximum extent possible, to require recipient countries, as a condition of transfer, to have such vessels repaired or refurbished at U.S. shipyards, including a U.S. Navy shipyard. Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the President should transfer on a grant basis certain excess aircraft and naval vessels to the Government of the Philippines; and (2) the United States should not oppose the transfer of F-5 aircraft by a third country to such Government."
