  <summary>10/24/2000--Introduced.
Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem misbranded any food that contains a known allergen unless its labeling bears a statement of such fact along with the name of the allergen. Makes such requirement applicable to known allergens contained in spices, flavorings, or colors.Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from considering any known allergen as an additive that qualifies for a food labeling requirement exemption applicable to incidental additives that are present in food at insignificant levels and that do not have any technical or functional effect.</summary>
