Reclamation Reform Refund Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to fully refund amounts received as payments (including the amount of associated interest) for charges assessed by the Secretary before January 1, 1994, for failure to file or properly file certain certification or reporting forms prior to the receipt of irrigation water pursuant to the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982. Provides that such refunds shall be made regardless of whether such payments were required by the United States, were made pursuant to a compromise or settlement, or were otherwise received by the United States. Requires, except with respect to the 1987 water year, such refunds to be reduced by a specified administrative fee for each failure to file certification or reporting forms. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
