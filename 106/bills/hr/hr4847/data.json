Provides that such refunds shall be made regardless of whether such payments were required by the United States, were made pursuant to a compromise or settlement, or were otherwise received by the United States. Requires, except with respect to the 1987 water year, such refunds to be reduced by a specified administrative fee for each failure to file certification or reporting forms.
