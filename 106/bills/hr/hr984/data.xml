Subjects to certain penalties exporters that engage in the transshipment of such articles (preferential treatment claimed on the basis of material false information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of the article or any of its components).(Sec. 104) Directs the Commissioner of Customs to analyze and the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to report to Congress on the extent to which partnership countries have cooperated with the United States with respect to the circumvention of existing quotas on imports of textile and apparel goods, and taken appropriate measures against circumvention violators (including exporters and importers involved in false information declarations relating to such goods).(Sec. 105) Directs the President to: (1) monitor the effects, if any, that implementation of NAFTA has on the access of beneficiary countries to the U.S. market for sugars, syrups, and molasses; and (2) in the event such implementation is adversely affecting such countries' access to the U.S. market, to take specified action to ameliorate such adverse effect.(Sec. 106) Grants duty-free treatment to rum liqueurs and spirituous beverages from Canada if certain conditions are met.(Sec. 107) Directs the President to convene a meeting with the trade ministers of the partnership countries in order to reach agreement for initiating negotiations for partnership countries to accede to the NAFTA.(Sec. 108) Directs the USTR to assess, and report to specified congressional committees on, the economic development efforts and market oriented reforms in each partnership country, and the ability of each country, on the basis of such efforts and reforms, to undertake the obligations of the NAFTA.Subtitle B: Revenue Offset - Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the exemption from certain requirements for treatment of welfare benefit funds of any welfare benefit fund which is part of a ten or more employer plan.

Stipulates that, if any portion of such a welfare benefit fund attributable to employer contributions is used for a purpose other than that for which the contributions were made, then such portion shall be treated as reverting to the benefit of the employers maintaining the fund (and thus becoming subject to specified nondeductibility requirements).Subtitle C: Suspension of Limitation on Cover of Tax on Distilled Spirits - Suspends between June 30 and October 1, 1999, the limitation on the cover over into the treasury of Puerto Rico of the tax on distilled spirits coming into the United States from Puerto Rico.
