  <summary>4/13/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Clean Air Act to suspend certain requirements for the use of reformulated gas and oxygenated fuels in nonattainment areas, and any such provisions under California law regarding such gas and fuels, upon a determination by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that, during the calendar month prior to such determination, the statewide average retail price of gasoline has been more than five percent above the baseline average price for California due to costs of complying with such requirements. Terminates such suspension upon the Administrator's determination that the statewide average retail price has been more than five percent below such baseline average price. Defines "baseline average gasoline price" as a statewide average price for gasoline sold at retail, for any calendar month, that is 120 percent of the statewide average retail price within California during the three-calendar year period preceding the calendar year in which such month occurs. Bars the retail sale of gasoline refined outside, and imported into, the United States in California during any suspension period.</summary>
