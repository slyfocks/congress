Terminates such suspension upon the Administrator's determination that the statewide average retail price has been more than five percent below such baseline average price. Defines \"baseline average gasoline price\" as a statewide average price for gasoline sold at retail, for any calendar month, that is 120 percent of the statewide average retail price within California during the three-calendar year period preceding the calendar year in which such month occurs. Bars the retail sale of gasoline refined outside, and imported into, the United States in California during any suspension period."
