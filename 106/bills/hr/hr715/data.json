Bans any candidate for election for Federal office from accepting any contribution from a nonparty political action committee. Title II: Ensuring Voluntariness of Contributions of Corporations, Unions, and Other Membership Organizations - Amends FECA to make it unlawful, except with the separate, prior, written, voluntary authorization of the individual involved, for: (1) national banks or corporations (except for certain tax exempt corporations) to collect from or assess their stockholders or employees any dues, initiation fee, or other payment as a condition of employment which will be used for political activities in which the national bank or corporation is engaged; and (2) labor organizations to collect from or assess their members or nonmembers any dues, fee, or other payment which will be used for political activities in which the labor organization is engaged. States that an authorization shall remain in effect until revoked and may be revoked at any time. Requires each entity collecting from or assessing amounts from an individual with an authorization in effect to provide the individual with a statement that the individual may at any time revoke the authorization. Requires applicable corporations, prior to the beginning of any 12-month period, as determined by the corporation, to provide each of their shareholders with a notice containing: (1) the proposed aggregate amount for disbursements for political activities for the period; (2) the individual's applicable percentage and pro rata amounts for the period; and (3) a form that the individual may complete and return to the corporation or organization indicating the individual's objection or approval to the disbursement of amounts for political activities during the period. Makes it unlawful for a corporation to make disbursements for political activities during the 12-month period in an amount greater than the sum of the applicable pro rata amounts for such period of all shareholders who return the form to the corporation prior to the beginning of the period and indicate their approval of such disbursement. Title III: Restrictions on Soft Money - Amends FECA to ban the solicitation, receipt, and use of funds (soft money) not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of FECA (FECA requirements) by national political parties and candidates, with the exception of certain activities. Requires that payments by State political parties for mixed political activities be subject to limitation and reporting under FECA as if such payments were expenditures, and permits such payments to be paid only from an account subject to FECA requirements. Prohibits transfers of funds between State political parties unless the funds are subject to the FECA requirements. Title IV: Effective Date - Establishes the general effective date for this Act, applicable to elections occurring after January 2001."
