TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Enrollment of Retirees in Tricare Prime and Medicare Reimbursement Title II: FEHBP Option for Retirees Uniformed Services Retiree and Dependents Health Care Availability Act - Title I: Enrollment of Retirees in TRICARE Prime and Medicare Reimbursement - States that the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) may not prohibit the enrollment of Medicare-eligible military retirees in the managed care option of the TRICARE program (a Department of Defense (DOD) managed health care program) solely on account of age or entitlement to hospital insurance benefits under Medicare part A. (Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS Secretary) to jointly establish a program (subvention program) that, beginning October 1, 2000, provides DOD with reimbursement from the Medicare program for health care services provided to Medicare-eligible retirees through the TRICARE program. Allows such reimbursement only if such retirees are also enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance program under Medicare part B. Requires program enrollment to be voluntary. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) waive enrollment fees; (2) modify existing TRICARE program contracts to incorporate enrollment provisions; and (3) establish cost-sharing requirements for enrollees. (Sec. 104) Provides for the determination of DOD reimbursement amounts, requiring the HHS Secretary to make such payments from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund. (Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to maintain current DOD health-care efforts for Medicare-eligible retirees in order to avoid imposing added costs to the Medicare program. Requires specified estimates of prior efforts and future targets with respect to DOD health care provided under the subvention program. Directs the Comptroller General to determine and report to the two Secretaries and Congress annually on the extent, if any, to which costs of the Secretary under the TRICARE program and the HHS Secretary under the Medicare program have increased as a result of the subvention program. Requires the Secretaries to take necessary action to offset any added costs. (Sec. 106) Requires the Secretary to reimburse subvention program participants for any late enrollment penalties imposed under the Medicare program. (Sec. 107) Provides that, in the case of a Medicare-eligible retiree who seeks to enroll in a Medicare supplemental policy, the issuer of such policy may not: (1) deny the issuance or effectiveness of such policy; or (2) discriminate in the policy's price. Makes eligible for both the subvention program and the Medicare supplemental program a Medicare-eligible retiree who: (1) is at least 65 years old and was eligible to enroll in Medicare part B; and (2) did not enroll in the Medicare program during his or her initial enrollment period. Title II: FEHBP Option for Retirees - Revises provisions concerning a demonstration project which includes certain covered military retirees and their beneficiaries within the Federal Employee Health Benefits program (FEHBP) to: (1) make such program permanent (currently terminates December 31, 2002); (2) remove certain reporting requirements; and (3) remove provisions concerning the application of Medigap protections to demonstration project enrollees. (Sec. 202) Requires the health and dental care benefits provided under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) and TRICARE Standard to be the same as those provided for the highest level of benefits under the service benefit plan of the FEHBP.</summary>
