Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 3632) Authorizes the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment to make grants to States and Indian tribes recognized by the United States that have a high rate, or have had a rapid increase, in methamphetamine or amphetamine abuse or addiction to permit such States and tribes to expand activities in connection with treatment in specific geographical areas.

Authorizes such agreement to provide $500,000, on a reimbursable basis, for such activities. Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle C: Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 - Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000 - Amends the Federal judicial code to direct the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines regarding any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in, 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine, (MDMA, or Ecstasy), paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA), or any other controlled substance that is marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure substantially similar to, or an effect on the central nervous system substantially similar to or greater than that of, MDMA (including an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act).Directs the Commission: (1) with respect to each such offense, to review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide for increased penalties that reflect the seriousness of those offenses and the need to deter them; and (2) to ensure that the Federal sentencing guidelines for offenders convicted of such offenses reflect the need for aggressive law enforcement action regarding offenses involving such controlled substances and the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving such substances.Expresses the sense of Congress that (1) the base offense levels for Ecstasy are too low and should be increased; and (2) the base offense levels for importing and trafficking the controlled substances described in the first paragraph should be increased.(Sec. 3664) Directs the Commission to promulgate amendments under this subtitle as soon as practicable after this subtitle's enactment in accordance with a procedure set forth in the Sentencing Act of 1987 (emergency guidelines promulgation authority) as though the authority under that Act had not expired.(Sec. 3665) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to make grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements for: (1) school-based programs concerning the dangers of abuse of and addiction to MDMA, related drugs, and other drugs commonly referred to as \"club drugs\"; and (2) community-based abuse and addiction prevention programs relating to MDMA, related drugs, and other club drugs. Requires a specified amount of the funds appropriated under this section to be made available to support and conduct periodic analyses and evaluations of effective prevention programs for abuse of and addiction to MDMA, related drugs, and other club drugs and the development of strategies for disseminating information about and implementing such programs. Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - Requires the head of each Federal department, agency, and establishment to place anti-drug messages on appropriate Internet websites controlled by such department, agency, or establishment which messages shall, where appropriate, contain an electronic hyperlink to the Internet website, if any, of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.(Sec. 3672) Authorizes the Attorney General: (1) through the DEA, to reimburse States and other public entities and consortia thereof for expenses incurred to clean up and safely dispose of substances associated with clandestine methamphetamine laboratories that may present a public health or environmental danger; and (2) to hire not more than five DEA personnel to administer this section.
