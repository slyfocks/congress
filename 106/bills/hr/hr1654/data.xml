TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Authorization of Appropriations Subtitle A: Authorizations Subtitle B: Limitations and Special Authority Title II: International Space Station Title III: Miscellaneous National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000 - Title I: Authorization of Appropriations - Subtitle A: Authorizations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2002 for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for: (1) human space flight; (2) science, aeronautics, and technology; (3) mission support; and (4) the Inspector General.(Sec. 105) Limits the total authorization of appropriations for NASA for each of FY 2001 and 2002.Subtitle B: Limitations and Special Authority - Sets forth limitations on, and special authorities (with prior notice to specified congressional committees) for, the use of funds with respect to the construction of new facilities and the repair, rehabilitation, or modification of existing facilities.(Sec. 124) Specifies limitations on the amount of funds that may be used for scientific consultations or extraordinary expenses.(Sec. 125) Earmarks a specified amount of the appropriations authorized for Earth Science for FY 2001 and 2002 for the Commercial Remote Sensing Program for commercial data purchases, unless NASA has integrated data purchases into the procurement process for Earth science research.(Sec. 126) Directs the Administrator to solicit comment on the potential impact of the participation of a foreign entity as a supplier of the spacecraft, spacecraft system, or launch system for a space mission and to consider U.S. national interests before entering into an obligation for such mission.Requires the Administrator to certify to Congress, at least 15 days in advance of any cooperative agreement with the People's Republic of China, or any company incorporated under Chinese laws, involving spacecraft, spacecraft systems, launch systems, or scientific or technical information, that such agreement is not detrimental to the U.S. space launch industry and will not improve China's missile or space launch capabilities.Directs the NASA Inspector General to conduct an annual audit of NASA policies and procedures for the export of technologies and the transfer of scientific and technical information to assess the extent to which NASA is carrying out its activities in compliance with Federal export control laws and such certification.(Sec. 127) Prohibits the obligation of any funds authorized by this Act for the definition, design, procurement, or development of an inflatable space structure to replace any International Space Station components scheduled for launch in the Assembly Sequence adopted by NASA in June 1999. Provides that nothing shall preclude NASA from leasing or otherwise using a commercially provided inflatable habitation module if such module would: (1) cost the same or less than the remaining cost of completing and attaching the baseline habitation module; (2) impose no delays to the Assembly Sequence; and (3) result in no increased safety risk.
