Fairness in Government Procurement Act of 1999 - Prohibits the Secretary of Defense from obligating or expending any funds appropriated to the Department of Defense to purchase from (or to participate in an intergovernmental transfer with) Federal Prison Industries (FPI) until FPI has: (1) implemented a cap on the sale or transfer of its furniture, metal products, electronic sub-components, textiles, textile products, clothing, and footware; and (2) submitted to Congress a legislative proposal to terminate (in phases during a seven-year period) its status as a mandatory supplier to executive agencies and a certification that the proposal is supported by FPI and was developed with input from stake holder groups. Bars the Secretary from entering into any contract for the purchase or transfer of FPI goods or services for under $100,000.</summary>
