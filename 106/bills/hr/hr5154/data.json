Sets forth similar requirements with respect to the reporting of possible defects in such vehicle or equipment that have resulted in a significant number of serious injuries or fatalities in a foreign country. Sets forth both criminal and civil penalties for manufacturers of foreign motor vehicle products who falsify information with respect to, or otherwise violate, the reporting requirements contained in this Act."
