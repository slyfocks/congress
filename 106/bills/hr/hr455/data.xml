  <summary>2/2/1999--Introduced.
Teacher Technology Training Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Education, through the Office of Educational Technology, to award grants to certain local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide classroom-related computer training to credentialed teachers. Allows such grants to be awarded for up to three years to LEAs in States in the Department of Education's Baby Boom Echo Report which are projected to have an increase in student enrollment of not less than 20,000 in public elementary and secondary schools during the next ten years. Requires grant applications to include a certification that the LEA has developed a progression of computer training for teachers that begins with basic classroom-related computer training and progresses through to a superior level of proficiency throughout the LEA. Directs the Secretary to provide at least one grant in each identified State to an eligible LEA that meets qualifications established by the Secretary. Authorizes the award of grants to additional eligible LEAs in such States based on application quality and school enrollment levels. Limits the amount of each grant award. Allows LEA use of grant funds to provide training by LEA personnel on school premises. Sets forth requirements relating to program evaluation, dissemination of results, and administrative costs. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
