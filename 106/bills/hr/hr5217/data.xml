  <summary>9/20/2000--Introduced.
Effective Labor Law Sanctions Act of 2000 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to direct the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), if it finds that an employee was discharged as a result of an unfair labor practice, to order: (1) award of back pay in an amount equal to three times the employee's wage rate at the time of the unfair labor practice; and (2) notify the employee of such employee's right to sue for punitive damages and damages with respect to a wrongful discharge under specified provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA).Amends LMRA to make it unlawful for any employer to discharge an employee for exercising rights protected under the NLRA. Allows an employee whose discharge is determined by the NLRB to be as a result of an unfair labor to file a civil action in: (1) any U.S. district court, without respect to the amount in controversy, to recover punitive damages; or (2) if actionable, in any State court to recover damages based on a wrongful discharge.</summary>
