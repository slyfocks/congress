  <summary>11/4/1999--Introduced.
Safe Pipelines Act of 2000 - Amends the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (the Act) to revise Federal minimum safety standards for gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities to require pipeline operators to be: (1) tested for qualification to perform enumerated activities related to the installation, testing, and maintenance of a pipeline; and (2) certified as qualified by the Secretary of Transportation to perform such activities.(Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary to require an operator of a pipeline facility that: (1) has an instrumented internal inspection device (smart pig) to test the pipeline once every five years for corrosion and anomalies and make test results available to the public; and (2) is not covered by a certain certification under a State pipeline safety program or by a State pipeline safety agreement to test the pipeline hydrostatically once every five years to redetermine its maximum allowable operating pressure of the pipeline and make test results available to the public.(Sec. 4) Requires pipeline operators to report to the Secretary hazardous liquid spills of more than 40 gallons and ruptures to pipelines.(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to make available on the Internet maps of the location of all pipeline facilities subject to the Act.(Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the effectiveness of: (1) external leak detection systems (including hydrocarbon sensor cables) for the purpose of improving pipeline leak detection; and (2) double-walled pipelines for the purpose of preventing ruptures and leaks.(Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary to complete cost-benefit analyses of all recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board to the Secretary that the Board classifies as being "open".(Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary to study and report to Congress on the optimal minimum burial depth of underground pipelines for the purpose of preventing the release of hazardous materials in the air.</summary>
