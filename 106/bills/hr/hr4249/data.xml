  <summary>5/15/2000--Passed House amended.
Cross-Border Cooperation and Environmental Safety in Northern Europe Act of 2000 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States Northern Europe Initiative is a sound framework for future U.S. involvement in Northern Europe; (2) the European Union should move expeditiously to authorize and fund the proposed "Northern Dimension" Initiative at appropriate yet substantial levels of assistance; (3) the United States should continue to support a wide-ranging strengthening of democratic and civic institutions on a regional basis to provide a foundation for political stability and investment opportunities, including cross-border exchanges, in Northern Europe; (4) the United States should demonstrate continued commitment to address environmental security challenges in Northwest Russia, in cooperation with partners in the region; (5) recently-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin should rapidly conclude pending nuclear waste management agreements to enable assistance programs to go forward; and (6) nuclear waste management assistance to Russia should only be provided after issues related to liability, taxation of assistance, privileges and immunities for foreign contractors, and audit rights have been resolved.Allocates specified sums from previously authorized appropriations for assistance and related programs for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States for the United States Northern Europe Initiative projects relating to environmental cleanup, law enforcement, public health, energy, business and trade promotion.Instructs the Secretary of State to report to Congress on: (1) the threat to environmental security presented by Russian marine nuclear reactor, waste, and contamination; and (2) possibilities for expanded United States and multilateral assistance programs for environmental clean-up in Northwest Russia, including technical exchanges and private- public partnerships.</summary>
