Requires each Federal agency to: (1) ensure that each information collection provides to persons required to submit information the option to use electronic submission, maintenance, or disclosure of information; (2) use information technologies that provide for electronic submission, maintenance, or disclosure of information to reduce burden and improve data quality, agency efficiency, and responsiveness to the public; and (3) publish a description of how respondents may electronically submit, maintain, or disclose the information to be collected. Requires the Director to report to the Congress on the extent to which Federal agencies reduced the collection of information burden on small businesses and other persons through the use of electronic submission, maintenance, or disclosure of information as a substitute for the use of paper."
