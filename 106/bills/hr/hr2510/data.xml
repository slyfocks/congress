  <summary>7/14/1999--Introduced.
Anti-Discrimination Act of 1999- Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make a defendant who purposefully engages in an unlawful employment practice by intentionally treating a covered person worse than another because of that covered person's race, gender, religion, or national origin guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a monetary fine (higher for a corporation than for an individual). Makes a subsequent conviction a felony if it involves conduct substantially similar to the first offense. Authorizes the U.S. Sentencing Commission to propose to the Congress amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines altering the sentences imposed under the amendment made by this Act.</summary>
