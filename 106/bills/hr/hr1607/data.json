Requires any charity receiving creditable donations primarily to assist poor individuals.(Sec. 103) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the effects of the charity tax credit under this title.Title II: Budget Offset - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the earned income credit for individuals without children.Title III: Tort Reforms Relating to Charitable Contributions - Relieves business entities of civil liability (except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct) relating to any injury or death: (1) resulting from use of equipment the entity donates, or from the operation (outside the scope of business of the entity) of aircraft or a motor vehicle loaned, to a nonprofit organization; (2) occurring at a facility of the entity used by a nonprofit organization (outside the scope of business of the entity), or during a tour of the facility (in an area otherwise not accessible to the general public). Preempts State liability law in this matter, but allows a State to elect not to allow this title to apply.Title IV: Charitable Choice Expansion Act - Charitable Choice Expansion Act of 1999 - Amends the Revised Statutes to prohibit the Federal Government and State or local governments receiving Federal funds for any assistance program (except certain education and child care programs) from discriminating against an organization providing assistance under, or applying to provide assistance under, such a program, on the basis that the organization has a religious character.Title V: Tax-free Distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts for Charitable Purposes - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from an individual's gross income any qualified distributions from individual retirement accounts to tax-exempt charitable organizations, charitable remainder trusts, pooled income funds, and charitable gift annuities."
