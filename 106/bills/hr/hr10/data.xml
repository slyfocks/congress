(Sec. 102) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) to exempt from its prohibition against interests in nonbanking organizations the shares of any company whose activities had been determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board), as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. (Sec. 103) Creates a statutory mechanism for the establishment of financial holding companies (FHCs) whose subsidiary depository institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed and meet other specified criteria. Instructs the Board to establish and apply comparable capital standards to a foreign bank with a subsidiary bank or commercial lending company in the United States. Permits an FHC to engage in any activity and acquire the shares of any company whose activities have been determined by the Board to be either financial in nature, or incidental to financial activities. Mandates consultation and coordination, between the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury (the Secretary) regarding determination of whether an activity is financial in nature, or incidental to financial activities. Includes among such activities any investments, lending, insurance, securities transactions, certain financial operations abroad, and ownership or control of banking interests. Mandates notification to the Board of certain large business combinations with FHCs. Requires an FHC to make assurances that risk management procedures adequately protect insured depository institution subsidiaries, including reasonable measures to preserve separate corporate identity and limited liability. Cites circumstances under which an FHC (and its foreign counterpart) may engage in nonfinancial activities. Permits FHCs which were not BHCs or foreign banks before becoming FHCs to retain limited non-financial activities and affiliations. Sets forth cross-marketing restrictions for FHC-controlled depository institutions. Requires the Board, when considering an FHC acquisition, merger, or consolidation, to consider the extent to which its subsequent failure or default after consummation could have serious adverse economic effects, or trigger financial instability ("too big to fail" factor). (Sec. 104) Preempts State anti-affiliation laws restricting transactions among insured depository institutions, wholesale financial institutions, insurance concerns, and national banks. Cites exceptions to such preemption, especially for State regulation of the business of insurance, including the retention of State capitalization requirements for an insurance entity acquired by another entity. Declares that this Act shall not affect State antitrust and general corporate law. Retains State oversight authority over specified financial activities other than insurance. Prohibits State regulation of the insurance activities of an insured depository institution or wholesale financial institution in any way that discriminates adversely between insured depository institutions or wholesale financial institutions and other entities engaged in insurance activities. (Sec. 105) Requires that mutual bank holding companies be regulated on the same terms as bank holding companies. (Sec. 105A) Amends the following banking acts to mandate public meetings concerning proposed large bank mergers and acquisitions: (1) BHCA of 1956; (2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA); (3) National Bank Consolidation and Merger Act; and (4) the Home Owners' Loan Act. (Sec. 106) Amends the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (RNIBBEA) to apply its prohibition against deposit production offices to interstate branches acquired or established under this Act, including all branches of a bank owned by an out-of-State BHC. (Sec. 107) Amends the FDIA to apply to any branch of a bank controlled by an out-of-State BHC certain requirements for branch closures by an interstate bank. (Sec. 108) Authorizes well-capitalized and well-managed limited purpose banks to engage in any banking activity. (Maintains the restriction that such banks may accept demand deposits or make commercial loans, but not both.) Prohibits such banks from permitting any overdraft (including intraday overdrafts), or incurring overdrafts in their accounts at a Federal Reserve Bank, on behalf of an affiliate, with certain exceptions. Permits such banks to: (1) issue corporate credit cards; (2) cross market affiliates; and (3) avoid divestiture by correcting violations within six months of receiving notice from the Board. (Sec. 109) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to Congress on the projected impact that enactment of this Act will have upon: (1) financial institutions with total assets of $100 million or less; and (2) upon insurance agents and consumers. (Sec. 110) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to study and report to Congress on the extent to which: (1) adequate services are being provided as intended by the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA), as a result of enactment of this Act (including services in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and for persons of modest means); and (2) credit is being provided to small businesses and farms as a result of this Act. Subtitle B: Streamlining Supervision of Financial Holding Companies - Amends the BHCA of 1956 to prohibit the Board from imposing any capital or capital adequacy criteria upon a non-depository institution FHC subsidiary that is: (1) in compliance with State or Federal capitalization rules; (2) registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and (3) duly licensed under State law. Prohibits the Board, in developing holding company capital adequacy requirements, from taking into consideration any affiliated investment company which is not a bank holding company (BHC) nor controlled by one holding 25 percent or more shares of the investment company worth more than $1 million. (Sec. 111) Authorizes the Board to transfer its BHC oversight authority to the appropriate Federal banking agency if a BHC is not significantly engaged in non-banking activities. Mandates Board deference to the SEC and relevant State securities and insurance authorities with respect to interpretations and enforcement of activities within their respective jurisdictions (functional regulation). (Sec. 112) Provides that a declaration filed by a company seeking to be an FHC shall satisfy BHC registration requirements but not any requirement to file an application to acquire a bank. Revises BHCA divestiture procedures to permit a BHC to elect divestiture of either a nonbanking subsidiary or an insured depository institution. (Sec. 113) Amends the BHCA and the FDIA, respectively, to declare ineffective and non-enforceable any Board or Federal banking agency action that requires an insurance company BHC, a registered securities broker-dealer BHC, or a bank subsidiary to provide assets to a subsidiary insured depository institution if the State insurance authority, or the SEC, determines in writing that such actions would have a material adverse effect on the BHC's financial condition. Permits the Board to order divestiture of the subsidiary in lieu of other action.

(Sec. 116) Prohibits the Board from taking any action under the BHCA or the FDIA against a BHC-regulated subsidiary unless it is necessary to prevent or redress an unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty by the subsidiary that poses a material risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of an affiliated depository institution or to the domestic or international payment systems. (Sec. 117) Declares that BHCA restrictions placed upon Board authority over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries also limit FDIC authority with respect to such companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. (Sec. 118) Amends the FDIA to prohibit the use of the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) to benefit any affiliates or subsidiaries of certain insured depository institutions in receivership, in default, or in danger of default, or of any insured depository institution in such circumstances that is acquiring another insured depository institutions. (Sec. 119) Amends the BHCA of 1956 to repeal strictures governing activities of bank holding company subsidiaries in connection with insurance and savings bank life insurance. Subtitle C: Subsidiaries of National Banks - Amends Federal law governing national banks to prohibit a national bank subsidiary from: (1) engaging in any activity or owning shares of a company engaged in any activity that is impermissible for a national bank; or (2) engaging in activity that is conducted under terms other than those that govern national bank activities (unless a national bank is expressly authorized to do so by Federal statute). (Sec. 121) Sets forth parameters within which a national bank may control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary that is controlled by an insured depository institution. Prohibits a national bank subsidiary from engaging: (1) as principal in specified insurance activities (except credit-related insurance), or in providing or issuing annuities; (2) in real estate investment or development activities; or (3) in insurance company investment activities that are permissible by statute for an FHC. Prohibits certain large-sized national banks (assets of $10 billion or more) from controlling a subsidiary engaged in financial activities unless such national banks are themselves subsidiaries of a bank holding company. Provides an interim period for the exclusion of certain newly affiliated depository institutions from CRA community needs requirements if the appropriate Federal banking agency has accepted an affirmative plan from the institution to achieve a "satisfactory rating" at its next examination. Prescribes procedural guidelines for mandatory consultation between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Board regarding any determination whether an activity is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. Enumerates identifying factors. Cites circumstances under which a national bank financial subsidiary may engage in activities which the Secretary has not determined to be either financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. Grants the Comptroller of the Currency enforcement powers, including subsidiary divestiture injunctions. (Sec. 122) Amends the FDIA and the FRA to prescribe safety and soundness firewalls applicable to banks and their financial subsidiaries, and to transactions between financial subsidiaries and other affiliates, including: (1) a proscription against consolidation of the assets and liabilities of financial subsidiaries with those of the bank; (2) mandatory procedures for bank identification and management of financial and operational risks posed by a financial subsidiary; (3) maintenance of separate corporate identity and separate legal status; and (4) Federal oversight examinations. (Sec. 123) Amends Federal criminal law to proscribe misrepresentations regarding depository institution liability for obligations of affiliates. (Sec. 124) Amends the FRA to repeal: (1) the Board's power to restrict the percentage of individual bank capital and surplus represented by loans secured by stock or bond collateral; and (2) the Board's duty to establish such restrictions with a view to preventing the undue use of bank loans for the speculative carrying of securities. Subtitle D: Wholesale Financial Holding Companies; Wholesale Financial Institutions - Chapter 1: Wholesale Financial Holding Companies - Amends the BHCA to set forth a statutory mechanism for regulation of wholesale financial holding companies that do not control a bank other than a wholesale financial institution (WFI) or specified, limited-purpose institutions. (Sec. 131) Specifies the limits of Board examinations of such companies. Prohibits the Board, in developing capital adequacy requirements, from taking into consideration any affiliated investment company which is not a bank holding company nor controlled by one holding 25 percent or more shares of the investment company worth more than $1 million.

Subtitle F: National Treatment - Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA) to terminate the grandfathered authority of a foreign bank or company under the IBA to engage in any financial activity, if it files a BHCA declaration to function as a qualified BHC (QBHC). (Consequently, foreign banks with grandfathered affiliates would be permitted to keep them on the same terms and conditions that govern domestic banking organizations.)

Grants the FHFB power to: (1) issue charges upon an FHLB or any executive officer or director for violation of law or regulation in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the bank, or any written agreement between the bank and the FHFB, and take affirmative action to correct conditions resulting from violations or practices, or to limit FHLB activities; (2) address insufficiencies in capital levels resulting from automatic membership of a Federal savings association in the local FHLB; and (3) sue and be sued. Repeals FHFB jurisdiction to approve the granting by an FHLB of a member's application to secure an advance. Expands the mandate of FHLB Affordable Housing Programs to include providing subsidies (in addition to subsidized interest rates) on advances for member lending for low- and moderate-income housing. Authorizes each FHLB board of directors to approve member requests for Affordable Housing Program subsidies. Revises guidelines governing reserves and dividends to permit dividend payments out of previously retained earnings or current net earnings (currently, only out of net earnings). Repeals the requirement for: (1) FHFB approval for such dividend payments; and (2) investment of FHLB reserves exclusively in U.S. obligations or certain other Federal Government-related securities.
