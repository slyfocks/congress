  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the Director of the Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation, in making estimates for any bill or joint resolution that reduces any rate of Federal taxation, to base the estimate of the effect of such rate reduction on a dynamic estimate of the changes in Federal revenues expected to result from enactment of the tax rate provisions of the legislation. Defines "dynamic estimate" as a projection based in any part on assumptions concerning probable effects of macroeconomic feedback.</summary>
