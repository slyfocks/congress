  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Small Business Common Sense and Fairness Act of 1999 - Directs the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) review the size standards of industries with the Standard Industrial Classification Codes of 15, 16, and 17 which were excluded in the 1994 SBA inflationary adjustment; and (2) adjust such standards for inflation for the purpose of deeming an enterprise in any such industry as a small business. Requires the Administrator, at least once every five years, to: (1) review and adjust for inflation such size standard for an enterprise deemed a small business for purposes of competing for Federal contracting opportunities based solely on annual revenues; and (2) report to the Congress and the President on findings and conclusions reached upon such review.</summary>
