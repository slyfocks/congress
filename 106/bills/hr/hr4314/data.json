Limits to $1.2 billion the maximum aggregate face value of such bonds. Allows bond funds to be deposited into an approved segregated program fund for such purposes. Allows such bonds to be held by regulated investment companies, with the tax credit passing to company shareholders.Terminates the credit for any bond issued after the ten-year period following issuance of the first qualified bond.Requires the reporting of credits received.Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to act within 30 days after any request for bond approval under this Act."
