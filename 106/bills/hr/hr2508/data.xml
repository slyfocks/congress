  <summary>7/14/1999--Introduced.
Individual Liability for Discrimination Act of 1999 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make individuals individually liable for acts of discrimination they commit in employment whether or not any other party is also liable. Declares that this does not reduce employer responsibility (except that, in awarding monetary relief against any party, the relief collected from other parties may be considered). Modifies the definition of "respondent" to include employees and agents of the employer.</summary>
