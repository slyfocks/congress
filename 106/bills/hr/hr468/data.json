Prohibits the Secretary from allowing any mineral development on federally-owned land within the Area, except for construction and maintenance of roads and facilities within the Area.Allows the Secretary to acquire: (1) land and structures within the Area to further the purposes of this Act; and (2) not more than ten acres of land (and improvements) on the mainland to provide access to, and administrative facilities for, the Area.Authorizes appropriations."
