International Olympic Committee Reform Act of 1999 - Amends the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 to prohibit a person doing business in U.S. interstate commerce from knowingly providing financial support to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), unless the Secretary of Commerce certifies to Congress that the IOC has implemented the recommendations contained in the March 1, 1999, Report of the Special Bid Oversight Commission established by the United States Olympic Committee, including: (1) establishing a policy that IOC members may not accept gifts of more than nominal value, or receive any money for travel expenses, from any city (or representative of such city) bidding to host the Olympic games; (2) establishing an independent office to monitor, investigate, and enforce violations of the requirements of this Act; (3) establishing a procedure by which a majority of IOC members are elected by national Olympic committees or by other constituent organizations; and (4) subjecting IOC members and leaders to periodic reelection. Declares that nothing in this Act shall: (1) restrict the first amendment rights of any person; and (2) prohibit a person from providing financial support to the U.S. Olympic Committee, any U.S. sports governing body, or any organizing committee for any Olympic games already awarded by the IOC upon the enactment of this Act. Sets forth a civil penalty for violation of the requirements of this Act.</summary>
