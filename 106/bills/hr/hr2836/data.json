    "text": "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1999 - Amends the Fair Housing Act to state that: (1) nothing in such Act shall be construed to make the expression of an opinion or the seeking of redress from public authority a violation of such Act; and (2) a party shall not be liable for engaging in litigation or administrative proceedings unless done so for an improper purpose, or not supported by evidence or warranted by existing law. (Sec. 3) Requires specificity of complaint. (Sec. 4) States that a provision of State or local law shall not be construed to violate fair housing provisions if the alleging party has not first exhausted State remedies. (Sec. 5) Provides that familial status protection shall apply to persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption and certain foster children. (Sec. 6) States that fair housing provisions shall not prevent local control of residential uses."
