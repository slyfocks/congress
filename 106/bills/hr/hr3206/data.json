Includes distributions in gross income as if they were social security benefits.Allows an excise tax on excess contributions to a personal retirement savings account.Title II: Social Security Surplus Protection - Amends SSA title II to provide for transfers of budget surpluses to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund for FY 2001 through 2009.(Sec. 202) Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to mandate the sequestration of the estimated net surplus in the social security trust funds for the budget year, less the transfers made above to reduce the public debt and to provide for associated reports regarding such sequestration.Title III: Social Security Benefit Reforms - Amends SSA title II to provide for: (1) a gradual increase in retirement age and early retirement age; (2) adjustments to bend points in determining primary insurance amounts; (3) information relating to benefit limitations in social security account statements; (4) coverage of newly hired State and local employees; (5) an increase in widow's and widower's insurance benefits; (6) elimination of the limitation on the amount of outside income (earnings test) which a beneficiary may earn without incurring a reduction in benefits for individuals who have attained retirement age; (7) acceleration of increase in delayed retirement credit; and (8) authorization for reimbursement of Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for certain costs of disability insurance benefits.(Sec. 309) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to study and report to the Congress on the most appropriate and feasible means of providing for elections under which individuals may opt for exclusion from OASDI coverage."
