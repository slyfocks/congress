Makes it unlawful for a State, State political subdivision or agency, interstate agency, or political agency of two or more States to restrict interstate commerce by enforcing any regulation or law that restricts the operation of a motor vehicle providing pre-arranged ground transportation service (limousine service) if the motor carrier providing such service: (1) is registered under specified Federal law for the interstate transportation of passengers; (2) meets all applicable requirements of the State or States in which the motor carrier is domiciled or registered to do business; and (3) was hired pursuant to a contract for travel from one State (including intermediate stops) to a destination in another State, or travel from one State (including one or more intermediate stops in another State) to a destination in the original State.Provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as subjecting taxicab service to Federal regulation pursuant to the Secretary of Transportation's authority over interstate commerce.</summary>
