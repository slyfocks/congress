Specifies that a \"qualified civil liability action\" may not be brought in any Federal or State court. Defines such term as a civil action brought by any person against such an individual for damages resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of the handgun by a third party where: (1) the handgun was accessed by another person without the permission or authorization of the person having lawful possession and control of the handgun; and (2) at the time such access was gained, the handgun had been made inoperable by use of a secure gun storage or safety device. Excludes from such term an action brought against the person having lawful possession and control of the handgun for negligent entrustment or negligence per se.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) civil penalties for violations; and (2) liability and evidentiary issues.Title III: Gun Shows - Amends the Brady Act to prohibit any person from organizing, planning, promoting, or operating a gun show without: (1) first verifying the identity of each show vendor participating by examining a valid identification document containing a photograph of the vendor; (2) first requiring each vendor to sign a ledger with identifying information and a notice advising the vendor of his or her obligations; (3) notifying each attendee of requirements under the Act; and (4) maintaining a copy of the records described above at the permanent place of business of the show promoter as the Secretary of the Treasury shall require.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) responsibilities of transferors and transferees other than licensees, including criminal background check requirements; and (2) records of licensee transfers. Specifies that nothing herein shall permit or authorize the Secretary to impose recordkeeping requirements on any non-licensed vendor. Sets penalties for violations of this Act.Authorizes the Secretary to enter during business hours the place of business of any show promoter and any place where a show is held for purposes of examining required records and the inventory of licensees conducting business at the show, without a showing of reasonable cause or a warrant.Increases penalties for: (1) serious recordkeeping violations by licensees; and (2) violations of criminal background check requirements.Requires that if receipt of a firearm would not violate specified Brady Act provisions or State law, the Federal criminal background check system shall destroy specified records (as under current law) as soon as possible, consistent with the Attorney General's responsibility to ensure the privacy and security of the system and to prevent system fraud and abuse, but in no event later than 90 days after the date on which the licensee first contacts the system concerning the transfer."
