Permits the President to make such supplies available for humanitarian purposes before they are made available to a State, local government, territory, or possession in response to a natural disaster emergency.Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the transfer of property for environmental protection in foreign countries unless the Administrator of General Services (GSA Administrator) determines that there is no Federal or State use requirement for the property under any other provision of law.Requires the GSA Administrator to report to the Congress on the effectiveness of surplus personal property donation and disposal programs (except for any program that grants access to personal property by local communities affected by the closure of a military base), along with recommendations for consolidating such programs under a single Federal authority."
