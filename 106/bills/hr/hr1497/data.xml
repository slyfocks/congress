  <summary>10/19/1999--Passed House amended.
Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 - Amends the Small Business Act to require all women's business centers to be private (current law) and nonprofit organizations.(Sec. 3) Directs the Small Business Administration (SBA) to: (1) perform an annual examination of the programs and finances of each women's business center; and (2) determine the viability of each center after such examination. Requires a report from the SBA to the congressional small business committees on the effectiveness of all projects conducted under the women's business centers program.(Sec. 4) Establishes a four-year pilot program under which the SBA is authorized to make grants on a competitive basis to organizations that have received assistance for participation in the women's business centers program and that: (1) are in the final year of a five-year project; or (2) have completed a financed project and continue to provide assistance to women entrepreneurs. Outlines grant participation conditions, including certification that the organization is private and nonprofit and submission of a five-year plan that demonstrates the organization's ability to serve women business owners or potential owners and to provide training and services to women who are both socially and economically disadvantaged. Outlines matching fund requirements and application procedures. Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2003 for the pilot program, earmarking specified amounts for administrative costs related to the selection of grant participants and sustainability grants.</summary>
