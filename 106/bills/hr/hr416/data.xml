Permits an employee affected by such an error that has been corrected, to elect to: (1) be CSRS-Offset covered instead; or (2) remain FERS covered.

Requires, not later than six months after the enactment of this Act, for a proposal, including any necessary draft legislation, to be submitted to the Congress permitting any employee affected by such an error (as applicable) that has already been corrected, but under less advantageous terms than would have been the case under this Act, to be afforded an opportunity to obtain treatment comparable to the treatment afforded under this Act.

(Sec. 125) Excepts employees whose rights have vested under FERS, CSRS, or CSRS-Offset (as according to this Act) from being automatically excluded under such coverage as applicable. Permits any employee who is erroneously vested: (1) under FERS, to elect to be automatically excluded from FERS or to remain FERS covered; and (2) in CSRS-Offset or CSRS, to elect to be automatically excluded from such coverage as applicable or to remain (or instead become) CSRS-Offset covered.

Provides that if the error has not been corrected, the employee shall be treated in the same way as if such employee had instead been CSRS-Offset covered. (Sec. 142) Requires that the effect of such an election be consistent with the effect of an election of any employee to be transferred from CSRS to CSRS-Offset. Subtitle F: Employee Who Should Have Been CSRS Covered, But Who Was Erroneously CSRS-Offset Covered Instead - Permits any employee who should be CSRS covered, but who is erroneously CSRS-Offset covered instead, to elect to: (1) be CSRS covered instead; or (2) remain CSRS-Offset covered.
