Replaces provisions relating to State matching funds (regarding this or other Federal programs) and limiting the amount of grants with provisions requiring: (1) a State that chooses to fund a project under this paragraph to submit a combined application for administrative grants and resource grants and match the combined amount of such grants in the ratio required in administrative grant provisions; and (2) that the Federal funding for the project be a portion of the State's annual allocation under administrative grant provisions. Allows resource grants to be used to pay a State's share of costs required under any other Federal program that is consistent with the purposes of this paragraph. Allows a State to allocate (in addition to currently-authorized recipients) to any reserve in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System a portion of any resource grant to carry out the purpose of this paragraph.

Jones Awards" program to promote excellence in coastal zone management by identifying and acknowledging outstanding accomplishments in the field. Modifies the source of the funds involved.(Sec. 215) Sets forth the nature of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a reserve if (among other criteria) the Secretary finds that designation will provide opportunities for education, interpretation, training, and demonstration projects (currently, for public education and interpretation). Revises the matters required to be included in the Secretary's guidelines for System research, education and resource stewardship (currently, for System research). Includes in the actions the Secretary must take to promote and coordinate System use for research establishing partnerships with other Federal and State estuary management programs to coordinate and collaborate on estuarine research.

Allows Federal funds allocated under the Act to be used by grantees to purchase Federal products and services not otherwise available.
