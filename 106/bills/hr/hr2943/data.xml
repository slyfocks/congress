  <summary>9/24/1999--Introduced.
Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 1999 - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to establish a program of incentive grants to improve the quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child care payment rates. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make such grants to eligible States from specified allotments. Conditions a State's initial eligibility on its having surveyed the market rates for child care services in the State within the two years preceding submission of its application. Authorizes the Secretary to make an annual payment to an eligible State only if: (1) the Secretary determines that the State has made progress, through the assisted activities, in maintaining increased payment rates; and (2) the State updates such survey at least once every two years. Requires the State, to be eligible to receive such a grant, to agree to make available State contributions in cash from State sources toward at least 25 percent of the costs of priority required activities and additional authorized activities. Requires an eligible State that receives such a grant to make priority use of such funds to increase significantly (up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey) the rate of reimbursement to providers for subsidized child care. Allows an eligible State, if it demonstrates to the Secretary that it has achieved such a payment rate for provision of child care assistance of the 100th percentile of the market rate survey, to use grant funds for any additional activity it demonstrates will enhance the quality of child care services. Requires evaluation reports by States to the Secretary, as well as biennial reports by the Secretary to the Congress.</summary>
