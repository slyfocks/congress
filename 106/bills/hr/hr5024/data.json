Requires such policies to: (1) be founded on a continuous risk management cycle; (2) implement controls that adequately address the risk; (3) promote continuing awareness of information security risks; (4) continually monitor and evaluate information security policy; and (5) control effectiveness of information security practices. Outlines information security responsibilities of each agency, including the development and implementation of an agency-wide security program for the operations and assets of such agency. Makes each program subject to Officer approval and annual review by agency program officials.Requires each agency to annually undergo an independent evaluation of its information security program and practices. Requires related reports.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 through 2005 to carry out information security provisions.(Sec. 6) Requires the: (1) Secretary of Commerce to develop, issue, review, and update standards and guidance for the security of Federal information systems; (2) Secretary of Defense and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop and issue more stringent information security policies for mission critical systems of such entities and ensure the implementation of such policies; (3) Department of Justice to review and update guidance to agencies on legal remedies regarding security incidents and coordination with law enforcement agencies concerning such incidents; (4) General Services Administration to review and update guidance on addressing security considerations relating to the acquisition of information technology; and (5) Office of Personnel Management to review and update regulations concerning computer security training for Federal civilian employees.Allows mission critical information security policies developed by the Department of Defense, CIA, and other agencies to be adopted by the Officer and heads of other Federal agencies with respect to mission critical systems of such agencies. Allows agencies to develop and implement more stringent information security policies than those required under this Act.(Sec. 7) Incorporates provisions of the Clinger-Cohen Act with respect to management of information technology.
