Declares that such determination shall not be effective if the President determines, and reports to the appropriate congressional committees, that, based on conclusive evidence, no substantial portion of the 7.2 metric tons of cocaine seized in December 3, 1998, in Cartagena, Colombia, was destined for the United States either directly or indirectly through Cuba."
