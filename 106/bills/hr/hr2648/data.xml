Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to require the Secretary of Transportation to establish by regulation a separate class of bonded warehouse for the storage and manipulation of international travel merchandise (duty-free or domestic merchandise which is placed on board aircraft on international flights for sale to passengers, but which is not merchandise incidental to the operation of a duty-free sales enterprise) pending its placement on board aircraft departing for foreign destinations. Sets forth specified requirements with respect to the treatment of such merchandise stored at bonded warehouses and staging areas (outside of the warehouse).</summary>
