(Sec. 2) Reserves specified portions of such funds for payments to Indian tribes and for quality assurance and quality improvement activities relating to programs under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (CCDBGA). Provides for allotment of funds among the States and territories according to a specified formula, or for matching payments based on certain portions of their expenditures for specified purposes authorized under CCDBGA. Requires targeting of such subsidy for child care assistance funds as follows: (1) at least 70 percent to working non-welfare families, who are not TANF recipients under a State or territory program; and (2) at least 40 percent for children who have not attained four years of age. (Sec. 3) Makes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2004 for child care quality and early learning programs under TANF. Provides for allotment of funds among the States, territories, and Indian tribes according to a specified formula, or for matching payments based on portions of their expenditures for a child care quality and early learning program under CCDBGA. Amends CCDBGA to establish the child care quality and early learning program. Sets forth program requirements for State participation and plans, allowable activities, and annual reports. (Sec. 4) Requires States to use at least four percent of CCDBGA assistance for one or more of the following: (1) resource and referral programs; (2) grants or loans to assist in meeting State and local standards; (3) monitoring of compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements; (4) training; and (5) compensation. Provides for a specified disregard of early learning program funds. (Sec. 5) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the dependent care tax credit and to provide an equivalent benefit where one parent stays at home to provide child care for child under age one. (Sec. 6) Allows a business-related tax credit for employer expenses for employer-provided child care assistance. (Sec. 7) Allows the dependent care credit against the alternative minimum tax."
