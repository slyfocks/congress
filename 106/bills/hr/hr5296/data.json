Makes this amendment effective as if included in the enactment of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.(Sec. 105) Amends SSA title XVIII part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) to extend for two years the moratorium on caps for therapy services.Title II: Medicare+Choice Program Improvements - Amends SSA title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice) with regard to calculation of annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates to provide, among other changes, for: (1) elimination of the budget neutrality adjustment for 2001 and 2002; (2) an increase in the minimum payment amount; (3) an increased update for payment areas with only one or no Medicare+Choice contracts; and (4) higher negotiated rates in certain Medicare+Choice payment areas below the national average.Title III: Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box - Social Security and Medicare Lock-box Act of 2000 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to make it out of order in the House or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report if its enactment would: (1) cause or increase an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year; or (2) cause the on-budget surplus for any fiscal year to be less than the projected surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for such year, or increase the amount by which the on-budget surplus for any fiscal year would be less than such trust fund surplus for that year. Makes the first point of order inapplicable to social security reform legislation, and the second inapplicable to Medicare reform legislation. Includes the receipts, outlays, and surplus or deficit in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance Trust Funds within the content of the concurrent budget resolution."
