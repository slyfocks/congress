    "text": "Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. executive directors to the international financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any extension of financial assistance of any kind to the Government of Indonesia (except humanitarian assistance to it or East Timor). Expresses the sense of Congress that such institutions should withhold the balance of any undisbursed approved loans or other assistance to the Government of Indonesia. Prohibits the availability of appropriated funds to Indonesia for: (1) economic and development assistance, except subject to the procedures applicable to reprogramming notifications; and (2) military assistance. Prohibits the licensing of exports of defense articles and defense services to Indonesia. Urges the President to coordinate with other countries (particularly member states of the Asia-pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum) to develop a comprehensive, multilateral strategy to further the purposes of this Act, including urging other countries to take measures similar to those contained in it. Imposes such prohibitions on the Government of Indonesia until the President determines and certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that: (1) a safe environment exists for the return of Timorese who were forced to flee the militia-led violence; (2) the UN Assistance Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) can resume its mandate pursuant to the June 11, 1999, authorization by the UN Security Council, without threat or intimidation; (3) steps have been taken to implement the results of the August 30, 1999, vote on East Timor's political status; and (4) the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia is conducting itself in a manner consistent with its responsibilities to its citizens and its international commitments. Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should strongly support the authorization of an international peacekeeping force for East Timor."
