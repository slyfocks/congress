Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, and Air Force for aircraft, missiles, weapons and tracked combat vehicles, ammunition, shipbuilding and conversion, and other procurement.(Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 for: (1) defense-wide procurement (earmarking a specified amount for the National Missile Defense (NMD) program); (2) the Defense Inspector General; and (3) the Defense Health Program.Subtitle B: Army Programs - Authorizes the use of multiyear procurement contracts for the M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the UH/60-CH/60 utility helicopters.(Sec. 112) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 to increase from 6,000 to 8,500 the number of bunker defeat munitions authorized to be acquired by the Army.(Sec. 113) Requires a report from the Secretary of the Army to the defense and appropriations committees on the process for developing the objective force in the transformation of the Army. Requires the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) to report to such committees on such process. Directs the Secretary of the Army to develop a plan comparing the costs and operational effectiveness of medium armored vehicles selected for infantry battalions and medium armored vehicles currently used for such battalions. Requires the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department of Defense (DOD) to approve the plan developed by the Secretary of the Army. Prohibits more than 80 percent of the amount appropriated for FY 2001 for new medium armored vehicles from being obligated until 30 days after the Secretary of the Army's report is submitted. Places funding limits with respect to future-year obligations for the acquisition of medium armored combat vehicles until certain comparisons and a certification have been completed.Subtitle C: Navy Programs - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to procure the aircraft carrier designated CVNX-1, and authorizes such Secretary to enter into contracts for advance procurement and construction of components for such carrier (earmarking funds authorized under this title for such purpose).(Sec. 122) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 to increase the number of Arleigh Burke class destroyers that may be procured by the Navy and to extend through FY 2005 the authority for such multiyear procurement. Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Navy, with respect to any such destroyers procured after FY 2001, should achieve the most economical rate of procurement by procuring three destroyers in each of FY 2002 and 2003 and one in FY 2004. Requires a report from such Secretary to the defense committees updating information required in a 1993 report on DDG-51 (destroyer) class ships. Requires such update to be transmitted to the Comptroller General (CG), and requires the CG to review such report and report review results to the defense committees.(Sec. 123) Earmarks FY 2001 procurement funds for the Virginia class submarine program, authorizing the Secretary of the Navy to enter into contracts for the procurement of up to five of such submarines during FY 2003 through 2006. Requires a report from the Secretary to the defense and appropriations committees on the Navy's fleet of fast attack submarines.(Sec. 124) Prohibits the Secretary, during FY 2001, from retiring from the active Navy force any Los Angeles class nuclear powered attack submarine or any Ohio class nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine until the Secretary certifies to Congress that the continued safe and militarily effectiveness of such submarine cannot be assured. Requires a report from the President to Congress on the required force structure for nuclear powered submarines to support the national military strategy through 2020.(Sec. 125) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to procure the construction of all ADC(X) class ships in one shipyard when determined to be more cost effective than construction in more than one shipyard.(Sec. 126) Earmarks FY 2001 procurement funds, and authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to contract, for the nuclear refueling and complex overhaul of the U.S.S. DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER during such fiscal year.(Sec. 127) Directs the Secretary of the Navy to conduct an analysis of the potential benefits and risks associated with alternative funding mechanisms for the procurement of various classes of naval vessels and other naval capabilities beginning in FY 2002.
