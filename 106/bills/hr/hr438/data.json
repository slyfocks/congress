    "text": "Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (and any other agency or entity to which the FCC has delegated such authority) to designate 911 as the universal emergency telephone number within the United States for reporting an emergency to appropriate authorities and requesting assistance. Applies such designation to both wireline and wireless telephone service. Requires the FCC to provide technical support to States for the deployment and functioning of a comprehensive emergency communications infrastructure, including enhanced wireless 911 service, on a coordinated statewide basis. (Sec. 4) Provides immunity from liability, to the same extent as provided to local telephone exchange companies, for providers of wireless 911 service. Provides immunity for users of wireless 911 service to the same extent as provided to users of 911 service that is not wireless. (Sec. 5) Authorizes telecommunications carriers to: (1) provide call location information concerning the user of a commercial mobile service to providers of emergency services, to inform such user's legal guardian or family members of the user's location in an emergency situation involving the risk of death or serious bodily injury, or to providers of information services to assist in the delivery of emergency response services; and (2) transmit automatic crash notification system information as part of the operation of such a system. Requires the express prior customer authorization of the use of either of the above information for other than the stated purposes. Requires a telecommunications carrier that provides telephone exchange service to provide subscriber list information (including information on unlisted subscribers) that is in its sole possession or control to providers of emergency services and emergency support services for use solely in delivering, or assisting in delivering, emergency services."
