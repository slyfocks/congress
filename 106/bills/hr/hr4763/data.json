Requires the Comptroller General to submit a report on each rule reviewed, including an independent evaluation of the agency's analysis of the costs and benefits, and alternative approaches in the notice of proposed rulemaking and in the rulemaking record, as well as of any regulatory impact analysis, federalism assessment, or other analysis or assessment prepared by the agency or required for the rule, and the results of the evaluation and the implication of those results. Grants the Comptroller General discretion to develop procedures for determining the priority and number of requests for review.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2000 through 2002.Provides for the pilot project established under this Act to continue for a three-year period, if specified appropriations are provided. Requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress on such project's effectiveness and on whether it should be authorized permanently."
