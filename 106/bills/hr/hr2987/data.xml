Authorizes such agreement to provide for FY 2001 $500,000, on a reimbursable basis, for such activities. Authorizes appropriations.Subtitle B: Other Matters - Amends the CSA to waive the requirement that practitioners who dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance or detoxification treatment annually obtain a separate registration for that purpose, and that the Attorney General register an applicant to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for such treatment, in the case of the dispensing by a practitioner of narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V, or combinations of such drugs (schedule III-V drugs) if the practitioner and the drugs meet specified conditions. Requires that: (1) the practitioner, before dispensing schedule III-V drugs to patients for such treatment, submit to the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General a notification of intent to begin dispensing such drugs for that purpose, including certifications that the practitioner is licensed under State law and has the ability to treat and manage opiate-dependent patients, has the capacity to refer the patients for appropriate counseling and other appropriate ancillary services, and meets other specified requirements; and (2) the schedule III-V drugs have been approved for use in maintenance or detoxification treatment and have not been the subject of an "adverse determination" (i.e., requires additional standards regarding the qualifications of practitioners to provide such treatment, or requires standards regarding the quantities of the drugs that may be provided for unsupervised use).Authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations through notice and comment rulemaking or practice guidelines to address the following: (1) approval of additional credentialing bodies and their responsibilities; and (2) additional exemptions from the requirements and any regulations under this section.Directs the Secretary to issue a Treatment Improvement Protocol containing best practice guidelines for the treatment and maintenance of opiate-dependent patients.Sets forth: (1) provisions regarding physician training and experience for purposes of the regulations or practice guidelines; and (2) procedural waiver requirements.Requires the Secretary to notify the physician and the Attorney General upon determining that a physician meets specified conditions. Directs the Attorney General, upon receiving such notice, to assign the physician an identification number for inclusion with the physician's current registration to prescribe narcotics. Specifies that an identification number assigned a physician shall be appropriate to preserve the confidentiality of a patient prescribed narcotic drugs by the physician.Requires the Secretary and the Attorney General, during the three-year period beginning on the date of this Act's enactment, to make determinations regarding whether: (1) treatments provided under such waivers have been effective forms of maintenance and detoxification treatment in clinical settings; (2) such waivers have significantly increased the availability of such treatment; and (3) such waivers have adverse public health consequences. Authorizes the Secretary to collect data from the practitioners for whom waivers are in effect. Sets forth further requirements with respect to the Secretary and the Attorney General, and further procedural requirements.Prohibits a State, during the three-year period, from precluding a practitioner from dispensing schedule III-V drugs to patients for maintenance or detoxification treatment in accordance with this Act unless, before the expiration of such period, the State enacts a law prohibiting a practitioner from dispensing such drugs. Authorizes appropriations.Title III: Miscellaneous - Requires the head of each Federal department, agency, and establishment to place anti-drug messages on appropriate Internet websites controlled by such department, agency, or establishment which messages shall, where appropriate, contain an electronic hyperlink to the Internet website, if any, of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.Title IV: Club Drug Anti-Proliferation - Directs the Commission to amend the guidelines regarding any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in, specified methamphetamine- and amphetamine- related "club" drugs (including any controlled substance marketed as a club drug and that has either a substantially similar chemical structure or effect on the central nervous system) in violation of the CSA, CSIEA, or MDLA.Requires the Commission: (1) in carrying out this title, with respect to each such offense, to review and amend the guidelines to provide for increased penalties comparable to the base offense levels for offenses involving any methamphetamine mixture; and (2) to ensure that the guidelines for offenders convicted of such offenses reflect the need for aggressive law enforcement action with respect to such offenses, and the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving such substances.(Sec. 402) Directs the Commission to amend the guidelines with respect to any offense relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, or trafficking in: (1) gamma-hydroxybutyric acid and its salts; or (2) the List I chemical gamma-butyrolactone.Requires the Commission, in carrying out this section, to: (1) review and amend the guidelines to increase penalties, and assure that the guidelines provide that offenses involving a significant quantity of Schedule I and II depressants are subject to greater terms of imprisonment than currently provided and that such terms are consistent with applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (2) consider specified dangers associated with the use of such substances, their rapidly growing incidence of abuse, and their recent increase in illegal manufacture.(Sec. 403) Directs the Commission to promulgate amendments under this Act as soon as practicable, as though the authority of the Sentencing Act had not expired.(Sec. 404) Amends the PHSA to authorize the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, public and nonpublic private entities to carry out school-based programs concerning the dangers of abuse and addiction to, and community-based prevention programs relating to, club drugs.Sets forth provisions regarding permissible use of grant funds, discretionary functions, priority in making grants, and evaluation and reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, in conducting its national media campaign under the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998, to ensure that such campaign addresses the reduction and prevention of club drug abuse among young people.Title V: Reimbursement by Drug Enforcement Administration of Expenses Incurred to Remediate Methamphetamine Laboratories - Authorizes the Attorney General: (1) acting through the DEA Administrator, to reimburse States, units of local government, Indian tribal governments, other public entities, and multi-jurisdictional or regional consortia thereof for expenses incurred to clean up and safely dispose of substances associated with clandestine methamphetamine laboratories which may present a danger to public health or the environment; and (2) to hire not more than five additional DEA personnel to administer this title. Makes certain funds available from unobligated balances available to DOJ to carry out the Community Oriented Policing Services Program under the Safe Streets Act. Authorizes appropriations.Title VI: Federal Drug Courts - Directs the court, upon the conviction of an individual for a Federal offense which the court determines is a nonviolent drug-related offense involving a simple possession quantity of drugs, to consider sentencing that individual to an appropriate rehabilitation program (which may include day fines, house arrest, electronic monitoring, intensive probation supervision, defense-based sentencing, day reporting centers, victim-offender reconciliation, shock incarceration, and substance abuse treatment in lieu of incarceration).(Sec. 602) Directs the Bureau of Prisons to establish and maintain a rehabilitation program consisting of residential substance abuse treatment and aftercare services. Directs that residential substance abuse treatment services be provided, to the greatest extent possible, by community-based drug and alcohol treatment programs. Requires the Bureau to report on January 1, 2002, and annually thereafter, regarding such program and the extent to which the Bureau has achieved compliance with this title's requirements.(Sec. 603) Authorizes appropriations.Title VII: Study of the Effect of Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Nonviolent Controlled Substance Offenses - Directs the Attorney General to report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the racial impact of mandatory minimum sentences for controlled substance offenses, their effectiveness in reducing drug-related crime by nonviolent offenders in contrast with other approaches such as drug treatment programs, and the appropriateness of the use of such sentences on nonviolent offenders.Title VIII: Rule of Construction - Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to impose any new mandatory minimum sentences.</summary>
