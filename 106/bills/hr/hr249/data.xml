Requires the SEC also to provide for a range of alternative guarantee arrangements providing for timely distribution of all, or a larger portion, of the balance in the personal retirement account to the account holder, which may be elected by the account holder upon payment to the SEC of supplemental premiums. Allows for the substitution of private insurance providing for a guarantee of timely distributions at the election of the account holder which is at least equivalent to the guarantee provided for by this title.Entitles an account holder, in certain cases, to a supplemental minimum benefit payment to their account upon application to the SEC on or after the normal retirement date.(Sec. 402) Directs the SEC to: (1) establish a risk-based assessment system for any qualified financial institution serving as trustee of a personal retirement account; (2) set semiannual assessments for such institutions to achieve and maintain the designated reserve ratio; and (3) notify each qualified financial institution of that institution's semiannual assessment.Sets forth a special rule until the Social Security Savings Insurance Trust Fund established by this title achieves the designated reserve ratio, as well as a special rule for recapitalizing the Trust Fund if it becomes undercapitalized.Provides that, in addition to the other assessments on qualified financial institutions, the SEC may impose one or more special assessments on qualified financial institutions if the amount of any such assessment is necessary: (1) to provide sufficient assessment income to repay amounts borrowed from the Secretary of the Treasury which become due; or (2) for any other purpose the Commission may deem necessary.Requires each qualified financial institution to: (1) file with the SEC a certified statement containing such information as the Commission may require for determining the institution's semiannual assessment; and (2) pay to the Commission the semiannual assessment imposed.Establishes penalties for inaccurate certified statements and for late payments.(Sec. 403) Establishes in the Treasury the Social Security Savings Insurance Trust Fund, made up of various specified funds, assessments, penalties, earnings, attorney's fees, and receipts.

Provides for the investment of trust fund assets.Authorizes the SEC to borrow from the Secretary of the Treasury.(Sec. 404) Authorizes the SEC to institute proceedings to terminate a personal retirement account whenever it determines that: (1) the SEC's possible long-run loss with respect to the account may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the account is not terminated; or (2) an insurable event has occurred. Provides for appointment of an alternative trustee pending issuance of a termination decree.(Sec. 405) Makes each person who is the financial institution serving as trustee of the account on the termination date or a member of the financial institution's controlled group jointly and severally liable to the SEC in any case in which a personal retirement account is terminated in a SEC-instituted proceeding. Sets such liability as the total amount of account assets guaranteed by the SEC which are not available for payment. Provides for payment of the liability.(Sec. 406) Requires each qualified financial institution, while serving as trustee for a personal retirement account subject to SEC guarantee, to display at each place of business maintained by such institution a sign with specified declarations relating to such accounts.Title V: Enforcement Authority - Provides for a personal retirement account holder adversely affected by an act or practice of any party other than the SEC in violation of this Act to bring an action in U.S. district court to enjoin such act or practice, or obtain other appropriate equitable relief. Grants the relevant Federal agency and the SEC the right to intervene in any such action.Title VI: Transition from Coverage for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Benefits Under Title II of the Social Security Act - Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to provide for primary insurance amounts for transitional eligible individuals under this Act who elect to participate in the personal retirement account payroll deduction programs of their employer.(Sec. 602) Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to provide a written certification to each individual with a social security account number who has been credited with wages or net earnings from self-employment indicating whether such recipient is or is not an eligible individual, together with a description of OASDI benefits available.(Sec. 603) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for a reduction in Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 taxes for wages and self-employment income imposed on an individual who has elected to forego OASDI benefits in favor of a personal retirement account.(Sec. 604) Amends SSA title II to: (1) add a supplemental retirement benefit program for certain individuals with personal retirement accounts; (2) provide for a phased-in increase in the social security retirement age; and (3) place a limitation on cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), with a reduction in COLA increases applied to higher primary insurance amounts.(Sec. 607) Provides for modification of the Consumer Price Index calculation of such COLAs.(Sec. 608) Amends SSA title II to provide for: (1) a phased-in reduction in spousal benefits other than survivors' benefits to 33 percent of the primary insurance amount; (2) coverage of newly hired State and local employees; and (3) adjustments in the formula for determining primary insurance amounts.(Sec. 611) Amends Federal law to require submission to Congress along with the Federal budget of a statement of the current accrued liability of the Federal Government for future benefit payments under the OASDI program.Title VII: Provisions Relating to Federal Civilian and Military Personnel - Directs the Office of Personnel Management to: (1) study and report to the President and Congress on how to provide for the application of this Act with respect to Federal civilian and military personnel; and (2) draft legislation which, if enacted, would carry out any recommendations in the report.(Sec. 702) Requires such report and draft legislation to address specified aspects of the existing Civil Service and Federal Employees' Retirement Systems for such Federal personnel.(Sec. 703) Specifies matters in the new system for the report and draft legislation to address with respect to the implementation of any other title of this Act.Title VIII: Social Security Transition Commission - Establishes the Social Security Transition Commission to make findings and recommendations about the most appropriate actions which should be taken to minimize, and adequately fund, any increases in budget outlays resulting from implementation of this Act.
