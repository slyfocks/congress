Amends such Act to prohibit: (1) the sale or other disposal of a firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person has committed an act of juvenile delinquency; and (2) the shipment, transport, possession, or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce of any firearm or ammunition by a person who has committed an act of juvenile delinquency."
