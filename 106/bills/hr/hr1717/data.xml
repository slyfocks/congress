  <summary>5/6/1999--Introduced.
Violent Youth Accountability Act of 1999 - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to provide that any State conviction or adjudication of delinquency which has been expunged or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall nevertheless be considered a conviction or adjudication of delinquency unless: (1) the expungement, set-aside, pardon, or restoration of civil rights (expungement) is directed to a specific person; (2) the State authority granting the expungement has expressly determined that the circumstances regarding the conviction and the person's record and reputation are such that the person will not act in a manner dangerous to public safety; and (3) the expungement expressly authorizes the person to ship, transport, receive, or possess firearms. Amends such Act to prohibit: (1) the sale or other disposal of a firearm or ammunition to any person knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that such person has committed an act of juvenile delinquency; and (2) the shipment, transport, possession, or receipt in interstate or foreign commerce of any firearm or ammunition by a person who has committed an act of juvenile delinquency.</summary>
