Provide that nothing in this Act shall prohibit such designation if, after the enactment of this Act, the additional segment is determined to be suitable.Prohibits any portion of a segment designated by this Act that is not in the National Park System (NPS) as of the enactment of this Act from being: (1) considered a part of the NPS; (2) managed by the National Park Service; or (3) subject to NPS laws or regulations.Bars the Federal Government from acquiring, by any means, any right or title in or to land, any easement, or any other interest for the purposes of carrying out this Act.</summary>
