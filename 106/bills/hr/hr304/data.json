    "text": "Comprehensive Health Access District Act - Defines: (1) \"comprehensive health access district\" as a community in which unemployment and the percentage of residents with incomes below the poverty line are greater than the national average, and in which a majority of certain diseases and conditions occur at rates greater than the national average; and (2) \"comprehensive community-based health access plan\" as an entity that provides health care services on a prepaid, capitated basis, or any other risk basis, and that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has certified meets certain requirements. (Sec. 3) Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require, among other things, that each Medicaid State plan provide that each comprehensive health access district located within the State is served by a comprehensive community-based health access district plan. (Sec. 4) Requires each Health Alliance or other health insurance purchasing cooperative created out of comprehensive health care reform legislation that receives premiums on behalf of persons formerly insured under Medicaid, and whose boundaries encompass a comprehensive health access district, to ensure that at least one comprehensive community-based health access plan is available to persons living in such district. (Sec. 5) Sets forth specified requirements for an entity to be certified as a comprehensive community-based health access plan. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to designate a community a comprehensive health access district and to certify an entity as a comprehensive health access plan provided they meet certain criteria. (Sec. 7) Requires each health access plan, in order to evaluate its performance in improving the health status of persons living in comprehensive health access districts, to provide the Secretary with specified health-related information."
