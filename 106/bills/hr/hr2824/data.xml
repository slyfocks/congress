Declares that an external appeal entity's determination is binding on the plan and issuer involved.Provides for court-imposed civil monetary penalties and cease and desist orders against authorized officials of plan or issuers who refuse to timely follow the determination of an external appeal entity to provide a benefit.(Sec. 104) Requires a plan and an issuer to establish a system featuring specified components for the presentation and resolution of grievances brought by participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees, or health care providers or other individuals acting on behalf of an individual either with the individual's consent or without it if the individual is medically unable to provide it. Declares that grievances are not subject to appeal under this subtitle.Subtitle B: Access to Care - Provides that if an issuer offers coverage of services only if they are furnished through members of a network of health care professionals and providers contracting with the issuer, the issuer shall also offer the option of coverage of such services which are not furnished through members of such a network, unless enrollees are offered such non-network coverage through another health insurance issuer. Makes the enrollee bear the cost of any additional premium the issuer charges for such option, and the amount of any additional cost sharing, unless it is paid by the health plan sponsor through agreement with the issuer.(Sec. 112) States that if a plan or an issuer requires or provides for designation of a participating primary care provider by a participant, a beneficiary, or an enrollee, then the plan or issuer shall permit each such person to designate any participating primary care provider available to accept such individual.Requires a plan and an issuer to permit each participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to receive medically necessary or appropriate specialty care, pursuant to appropriate referral procedures, from any qualified participating health care professional available to accept such individual.(Sec. 113) Requires a plan or an issuer providing or covering any emergency hospital benefits to cover emergency services: (1) without the need for any prior authorization determination; (2) whether or not the health care provider furnishing such services is a participating health care provider; and (3) without regard to any other term or condition of such coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, or an affiliation or waiting period, permitted under the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), or the Internal Revenue Code, and other than applicable cost-sharing).Requires such coverage in a manner so that, if the emergency services are provided by a nonparticipating health care provider with or without prior authorization or by a participating provider without such authorization, the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is not liable for amounts exceeding the liability that would be incurred if the services were provided by a participating provider with prior authorization.Prescribes the same coverage for maintenance care or post-stabilization care (subject to certain guidelines) by nonparticipating health care providers.Sets out provisions with regard to the coverage of emergency ambulance services.(Sec. 114) Requires plans and issuers to refer participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees who have a serious disease or condition requiring treatment by a specialist, or who require physician pathology services, to an appropriate specialist who is available and accessible (regardless of whether the specialist is participating or nonparticipating), provided the benefits for such treatment are covered by the plan or issuer.

Declares null and void any such contract or agreement provisions.(Sec. 132) Prohibits a plan or issuer from discriminating with respect to participation or indemnification as to any provider acting within the scope of the provider's license or certification, solely on the basis of such license or certification.(Sec. 133) Prohibits any plan or issuer from operating any physician incentive plan that does not meet certain requirements under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act.(Sec. 134) Requires a plan or issuer to provide for prompt payment of claims in a manner consistent with Medicare clean claims requirements.Subtitle E: Definitions - Sets forth definitions.Title II: Application of Quality Care Standards to Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Coverage Under The Public Health Service Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require each plan and issuer to comply with the patient protection requirements of this Act.(Sec. 202) Requires each health insurance issuer to comply with such requirements with respect to individual health insurance coverage.Title III: Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 - Amends ERISA to: (1) require each plan and issuer to comply with the patient protection requirements of this Act; and (2) deem a plan in compliance with subtitle A of title I of this Act to be in compliance with ERISA's claim procedure requirement with respect to claims denial.(Sec. 302) Makes liable to a participant or beneficiary (or his or her estate) for economic and noneconomic damages any fiduciary of a plan, issuer, or an agent of the plan or plan sponsor: (1) who has authority to make final decisions in the internal appeals process established by this Act; and (2) fails to exercise ordinary care in making an incorrect determination that an item or service is excluded from coverage, and such failure is the proximate cause of personal injury to, or wrongful death of, such participant or beneficiary.
