  <summary>5/20/1999--Introduced.
Gun Show Accountability Act - Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit any person from organizing, planning, promoting, or operating a gun show without: (1) registering with the Secretary of the Treasury and paying a registration fee; (2) first verifying the identity of each show vendor participating by examining a valid identification document containing a photograph of the vendor; (3) first requiring each vendor to sign a ledger with identifying information and a notice advising the vendor of his or her obligations; (4) notifying each attendee of requirements under the Act; and (5) maintaining a copy of the records described above at the permanent place of business of the show promoter for such period of time and in such form as the Secretary shall require. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) responsibilities of transferors and transferees other than licensees, including criminal background check requirements; and (2) records of licensee transfers. Sets penalties for violations of this Act. Authorizes the Secretary to enter during business hours the place of business of any show promoter and any place where a show is held for purposes of examining required records and the inventory of licensees conducting business at the show, without a showing of reasonable cause or a warrant. Increases penalties for: (1) serious recordkeeping violations by licensees; and (2) violations of criminal background check requirements. Amends the Brady Act to require the national instant criminal background check system, if receipt of a firearm would not violate the Act or State law, to destroy records of the system relating to the call and to the person or transfer (current law) as soon as possible but in no event later than 90 days after the date on which the licensee first contacts the system with respect to the transfer.</summary>
