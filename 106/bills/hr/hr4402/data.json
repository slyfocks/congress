    "text": "Training and Education for American Workers Act of 2000 - Amends the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 (as contained in title IV of division C of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law 105-277)) to revise provisions for the use of amounts deposited into the H-1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account for demonstration programs and projects to provide technical skills training for employed and unemployed workers.Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) use 75 percent of such funds to award grants to provide such training for any skill shortage related to a specialty occupation, as defined under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and (2) transfer 25 percent of such funds to the Secretary of Education for a student loan forgiveness program for mathematics, science, and reading teachers.Revises such training grant eligibility provisions. Requires certain eligible local, regional, or multi-State consortia to act in conjunction with, and with the active participation of, eligible local workforce investment boards. Requires 25 percent matching funds from grantees.Gives priority for such training grants to programs or projects that train employed and unemployed workers in skills that are in shortage in the high technology, information technology, and biotechnology fields, including software and communications services, telecommunications, systems installation and integration, computers and communications hardware, health care technology, biotechnology, and biomedical research, manufacturing, and innovation services.Requires grantees to make active efforts to recruit and train individuals traditionally underrepresented in information technology occupations, such as minorities, women, low-wage workers, workers residing in empowerment zones and enterprise communities, and individuals with a disability.Establishes such student loan forgiveness program, for specified loans made under the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), for new borrowers after October 1, 1998, who have been employed as full-time teachers of mathematics, science, or a related field, or have been full-time teachers responsible for providing reading instruction in any of grades kindergarten through third grade, for three consecutive complete school years.Sets forth various qualifications which loan forgiveness applicants must demonstrate with respect to their being fully qualified teachers in: (1) public elementary or secondary schools; or (2) nonprofit private elementary or secondary schools or charter schools."
