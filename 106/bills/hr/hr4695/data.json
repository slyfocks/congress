Authorizes the court to issue a pretrial restraining order or take any other action necessary to ensure that any bank account or other property held by the defendant in the United States is available to satisfy a judgment under such provisions.(Sec. 5) Includes a foreign bank within the definition of \"financial institution\" for purposes of money laundering provisions.(Sec. 6) Expands the definition of \"specified unlawful activity\" to cover certain listed offenses, including, with respect to a financial transaction occurring in the United States, an offense against a foreign nation involving: (1) a crime of violence; (2) bribery of a public official; (3) smuggling or export control violations involving munitions listed in the United States Munitions List or technologies with military applications; and (4) an offense under which the United States would be obligated by a multilateral treaty either to extradite the alleged offender or to submit the case for prosecution if the offender were found within U.S. territory.

Directs the court, upon a showing by the property owner by a preponderance of the evidence that the currency or monetary instruments involved were derived from a legitimate source and were intended for a lawful purpose, to reduce the forfeiture to the maximum amount that is not grossly disproportional to the gravity of the offense.Revises provisions regarding search and forfeiture of monetary instruments to direct the court, in imposing sentence for any violation of specified currency and monetary instrument reporting requirements, or conspiracy to commit such a violation, to order the defendant to forfeit all property involved in the offense and any property traceable thereto.Sets forth provisions regarding procedures governing forfeiture, civil forfeiture, and proportionality of the forfeiture.(Sec. 19) Provides that any person who conceals more than $10,000 in currency in any vehicle or in any compartment or container within any vehicle and transports such currency in interstate commerce on any public road or highway, knowing that the currency was derived from or intended to be used to promote some form of unlawful activity, shall be punished under prohibitions against engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. Allows the defendant's knowledge to be established by proof that the defendant was willfully blind to the source or intended use of the currency.(Sec. 20) Subjects to civil forfeiture property involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of Internal Revenue Code (IRC) provisions regarding returns relating to cash received in trade or business (which include provisions regarding cash receipts of more than $10,000) or any property traceable to such property (see also section 27).(Sec. 21) Modifies civil forfeiture provisions to: (1) subject to civil forfeiture any property within U.S. jurisdiction constituting, derived from, or traceable to certain foreign crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and which would be punishable under U.S. law by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if such conduct had occurred within U.S. jurisdiction, or any property used to facilitate such offense; and (2) authorize the Attorney General or the Secretary to transfer forfeited personal property or proceeds to a foreign country which participated in the seizure or forfeiture of the property if specified conditions are met whenever property is civilly or criminally forfeited under any provision of Federal law.(Sec. 23) Amends the code and the CSA to provide that to the extent that a forfeiture order includes only an in personam money judgment against the defendant, no proceeding with respect to publication of notice of the order, the Government's intent to dispose of the property, and notice to persons known to have alleged an interest in the property shall be necessary.(Sec. 24) Amends CSA criminal forfeiture provisions to provide that: (1) if property subject to criminal forfeiture is already in U.S. custody, it shall not be necessary to seize or restrain the property for the purpose of criminal forfeiture; and (2) upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of substitute property, subject to specified requirements.(Sec. 26) Includes tribal governments within the definition of a \"financial institution\" for purposes of Federal record keeping and reporting requirements regarding monetary transactions.(Sec. 27) Transfers from the Internal Revenue Code to other Federal law governing monetary transactions specified reporting requirements relating to coins and currency (in sums of more than $10,000) received in nonfinancial trade or business.(Sec. 28) Provides for civil and criminal penalties for willful violations of orders the Secretary may issue to financial institutions in a geographic area (geographic targeting orders) or other specified regulations.
