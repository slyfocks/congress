    "text": "Recreational Waters Protection Act - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to review the capabilities of existing marine sanitation technology and publish revised standards for marine sanitation devices pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Provides that such standards shall require a baseline effluent water quality for fecal coliform of up to ten milliliters per 100 milliliters and a reduction in biological oxygen demand of at least 50 percent.Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to condition a State's authority to prohibit the discharge of sewage from all vessels on a State certification that effluent from marine sanitation devices is impairing water quality and such a prohibition will result in measurable improvements in water quality. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to vessels that operate a type I or II marine sanitation device that meets the revised standards pursuant to this Act."
