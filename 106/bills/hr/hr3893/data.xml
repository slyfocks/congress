  <summary>3/9/2000--Introduced.
Anti-Ocean Dumping Act of 2000 - Amends the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 to prohibit the issuance of a permit authorizing transportation of material for purposes of dumping at the Historic Area Remediation Site (dredged material disposal area located east of Sandy Hook, New Jersey) and provides that no permit authorizing such transportation shall be effective other than one for transportation of qualified dredged material.Requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations that establish requirements for material to be considered qualified dredged material. Provides that material is not qualified dredged material unless the levels of each contaminant in the material: (1) do not exceed the background ambient contamination level for that contaminant; (2) will not cause undesirable effects; and (3) will be protective to the most sensitive marine species at the most sensitive life stages.</summary>
