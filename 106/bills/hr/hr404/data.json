    "text": "Student Protection From Sexual Abuse Act of 1999 - Amends provisions against sexual discrimination of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to impose on employers vicarious liability for conduct by their employees. Imposes such liability if the conduct would have violated such title if engaged in by the employer, and if: (1) the employee was aided in accomplishing such conduct by the existence of an agency relationship with the employer or the approval of the employer; or (2) the employer knew or should have known of such conduct and did not take action to stop it. Makes it an affirmative defense to liability for damages, under specified conditions, that: (1) the employer communicated to the employee and the aggrieved individual its policy against such conduct and violation; (2) the employer established and made available to such individual complaint procedures to prevent such conduct and violation; and (3) such individual did not use such procedures to prevent such violation. Allows the court to award appropriate legal and equitable relief for such a claim."
