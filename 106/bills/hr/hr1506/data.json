    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1999-04-21", 
    "text": "Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1999 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of public land in the State of Nevada under specified current land use plans other than land identified under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998. Authorizes the State or local governments in the jurisdiction of which the land is located to obtain the land for local public purposes prior to the offering of such land for sale or exchange. Requires the Secretary to retain such land for conveyance to the State or a local government if such entities elect to obtain the land. Withdraws Federal land selected for disposal, subject to valid existing rights, from location and entry under the mining laws and from operation under the mineral and geothermal leasing laws until the Secretary terminates the withdrawal or the land is patented. Requires the Secretary, the local government that has jurisdiction over land identified for disposal, and the State to select land to be offered for sale or exchange. Sets forth requirements for sales, including those for competitive bidding. Bars the sale of a tract of land if the Federal costs of sale preparation and processing are estimated to exceed sale proceeds. Allocates the gross proceeds of land sales during a fiscal year as follows: (1) five percent to the State for the general education program; (2) 45 percent to the local government for use as determined by such government; and (3) 50 percent to the Special Account established by this Act. Sets forth requirements for land exchanges. Authorizes the Secretary, subject to certain consultation requirements, to use funds to acquire environmentally sensitive land and interests in such land. Permits such acquisitions only from willing sellers and with the consent of the State and local governments with jurisdiction. Defines \"environmentally sensitive land\" as land that would: (1) promote the preservation of specified values that contribute to public enjoyment or biological diversity; (2) enhance recreational opportunities or public access; (3) provide the opportunity to achieve better management of public land through consolidation of Federal ownership; or (4) otherwise serve the public interest. Includes such lands in the definition of \"entitlement land\" for purposes of Federal provisions governing payment for entitlement land. Establishes a Special Account in the Treasury to carry out this Act. Authorizes appropriations."
