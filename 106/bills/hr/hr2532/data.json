    "text": "National Heritage Areas Policy Act of 1999 - Allows an area to be designated a national heritage area only if: (1) it meets specified criteria, including having natural, cultural, or historic features and its residents, local nonprofit organizations and entities, and governments are willing to support such designation and manage it; and (2) it is so designated by an Act of Congress.Directs the Secretary of the Interior to submit to specified congressional committees a study on the feasibility of designating any such area. Limits the Federal share of costs for such studies to 50 percent. Directs the Secretary to annually submit to Congress a prioritized list of projects at such areas, based on submissions from governors of affected States. Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to local coordinating entities for reports, studies, interpretive exhibits and programs, historic preservation projects, and operating expenses at an area. Limits such grants to a ten-year period beginning on the date of designation. Prohibits such grants after three years unless the local coordinating entity submits a Heritage Plan for such area and each affected governor approves the Plan. Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants and technical assistance for an area previously designated by an Act of Congress, under certain conditions. Protects private property owners from provisions of this Act.Authorizes appropriations, with a $10 million annual limit and a limit of $1 million for any one area during a fiscal year."
