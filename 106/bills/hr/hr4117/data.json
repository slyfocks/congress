    "text": "Collegiate Athletics Due Process Act of 2000 - Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to oblige institutions of higher education, under student aid program participation agreements, to ensure that student-athletes' due process rights are respected if they are accused of violations or infractions of amateur sports rules, including rules and legislation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).Requires the institution to provide any such accused student- athlete with separate independent legal counsel at the institution's expense immediately upon any investigation or alleged violation or infraction, and through the entire investigation, until all matters and facts of the pending case (and any other investigations that may arise out of the initial investigation) have concluded to the satisfaction of all parties involved.Requires the accused student-athlete to be given: (1) notice and opportunity to be heard before an arbitrator, neutral party, or tribunal not associated with the NCAA or a member institution, before any enforcement actions are administered by the institution; and (2) at all hearings, the opportunity to be heard and the right of controverting every material fact bearing on individual or private rights involved.Requires any enforcement action taken by the institution in compliance with rules or legislation of the NCAA for amateur sports violations to be clearly established on the basis of specific standards and guidelines for all possible infractions, including punishment or restitution.Makes this Act inapplicable to disciplinary actions taken by a coach or college administrator for violations of the institution's policy or conduct rules that apply to the entire student body of the institution."
