  <summary>7/25/2000--Introduced.
Amends Federal transportation law to exempt from Federal preemption (thus allowing) States to regulate tow truck operations whether or not they are performed without the prior consent or authorization of the transported motor vehicle's owner or operator. (Currently, State regulation of the price of for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck is permitted only if the transportation is performed without such prior consent.)</summary>
