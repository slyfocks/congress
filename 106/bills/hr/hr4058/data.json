Includes among activities for retention and retraining: (1) testing and merit pay programs; (2) performance bonuses; (3) scholarships to pursue advanced course work in the academic subjects teachers teach; (4) mentoring programs for teachers; and (5) other programs that the State believes to be effective in retaining and retraining quality teachers. Requires State reports on how activities using program grant funds improved teacher quality.

Requires such individuals to teach in a public school for two years after their certification. Requires individuals who do not fulfill their service or certification requirements to repay their stipends under certain circumstances.
