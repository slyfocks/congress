  <summary>11/17/1999--Introduced.
Free Television Viability Act of 1999 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to modify its multiple television broadcast ownership rules by increasing to 40 (currently 35) percent the national audience reach limitation (limitation) for television stations owned by a single entity.States that the FCC, in connection with an application for the assignment or transfer of a television broadcast station (TV) license: (1) shall increase such limitation by an additional five percent if there is in effect a private or governmental program which has had the effect of increasing ownership of TV stations by members of minority groups; and (2) may further increase such limitation by an additional five percent unless the FCC determines that a direct correlation exists between lack of ownership of TV stations by minority groups and increasing such limitation.Directs the FCC to study and report to specified congressional committees on the impact of raising such limitation on the entry of small businesses and members of minority groups into TV broadcasting.Directs the FCC, in making assignments of spectrum returned to the FCC for reallocation, to give priority to applicants undertaking a commitment to broadcast in a language other than English or which represents traditionally underserved communities.</summary>
