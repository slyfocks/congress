Comprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction Act - Amends the Public Health Service Act (the Act) to authorize the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, public and non-profit private entities to carry out: (1) school-based programs concerning the dangers of methamphetamine abuse and addiction, including initiatives that give students the responsibility to create their own anti-drug abuse education programs for their schools; and (2) community based methamphetamine abuse and addiction prevention programs. Requires that: (1) sums made available be used for planning, establishing, or administering methamphetamine prevention programs; and (2) the Director give priority in making grants to rural and urban areas that are experiencing a high rate or rapid increases in methamphetamine abuse and addiction. Sets forth: (1) provisions regarding allotment of specified sums available for analyses and evaluations of effective prevention programs and the development of strategies for disseminating information about, and implementing, such programs; and (2) reporting requirements. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 3) Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend existing Federal sentencing guidelines to increase the base offense levels for offenses relating to the manufacture, attempt to manufacture, or conspiracy to manufacture amphetamine or methamphetamine. Authorizes appropriations to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to combat the trafficking of methamphetamine in areas designated by the Director of National Drug Control Policy as high intensity drug trafficking areas. Earmarks specified sums to assist drug analysis laboratories in areas with a high rate of methamphetamine abuse or addiction. (Sec. 4) Amends the Act to authorize the Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention to make grants to, and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with, public and non-profit private entities for the purpose of expanding activities for the treatment of methamphetamine abuse and addiction, and for the treatment of methamphetamine addicts who also abuse other illegal drugs. Sets forth analogous provisions regarding the use of funds, permissible treatment programs and activities, priority in making grants, analyses and evaluation, reporting requirements, and authorization of appropriations. (Sec. 5) Amends the Act to authorize the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse to make grants to expand interdisciplinary research relating to methamphetamine abuse and addiction and other biomedical, behavioral, and social issues related to methamphetamine abuse and addiction. Requires the Director to promptly disseminate research results to Federal, State, and local entities involved in combating methamphetamine abuse and addiction. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 6) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to States, State and local courts, local governments, and Indian tribal governments for programs that involve: (1) continuing judicial supervision over offenders with substance abuse problems who are not violent offenders; and (2) the integrated administration of specified other sanctions and services, including mandatory periodic drug testing during any period of supervised release or probation for each participant, referral to a community-based treatment facility, and aftercare services. Directs the Attorney General to suspend funding for any grant upon finding that violent offenders are participating. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Directs: (1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convene a National Conference on Methamphetamine Abuse and Treatment; and (2) the Attorney General, jointly with the Secretaries of Education and HHS and the Director of ONDCP, to develop a comprehensive strategic plan to combat the methamphetamine problem in the United States.</summary>
