  <summary>6/26/2000--Introduced.
Streamlined Environmental Reporting and Pollution Prevention Act of 2000 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to integrate and streamline reporting requirements.Requires the Administrator, to ensure consistency and facilitate use of the integrated reporting system to be established, to: (1) allow each person required to submit information to the Administrator to report to one point of contact using a single electronic system or paper form and, in the case of an annual reporting requirement, at one time during the year; (2) identify environmental or occupational safety or health reporting requirements that are not administered by the Administrator; (3) implement data standards and a nomenclature understandable to persons without environmental expertise; (4) consolidate reporting of data that would be required to be reported at more than one point in the same data submission; (5) provide for data formats and submission protocols that conform with public-domain standards for electronic commerce, are accessible to a majority of reporting persons, and provide for data integrity and reliability; (6) establish a National Environmental Data Model that the Administrator shall use as the framework for databases on which reported information shall be kept and that the Administrator shall allow other Federal agencies and governments to use; (7) establish an electronic commerce service center to provide technical assistance to persons submitting electronic reports; (8) provide each reporting person access to scientifically sound, publicly available information on pollution prevention technologies and practices; (9) provide protection of confidential business information; and (10) provide free software to assist reporting persons in assembling information and receiving information on pollution prevention technologies and practices.Provides that nothing in this Act requires a person to use the integrated reporting system instead of an individual reporting system.(Sec. 4) Requires the Administrator, at the request of any Federal, State, tribal, or local agency, to coordinate the integration of reporting required under this Act with similar efforts by the agency that are consistent with this Act.Authorizes the Administrator to develop a procedure under which a person that is required to report information under laws administered by the Administrator and laws administered by a State, tribal, or local agency to report all required information through one point of contact using a single electronic system or paper form and, in the case of an annual reporting requirement, at one time each year.Directs the Administrator, to facilitate reporting by persons with facilities in more than one State, tribal, or local jurisdiction, to encourage the use of a common data format by any State, tribal, or local agency coordinating with the Administrator.(Sec. 6) Requires the Administrator to report to Congress on provisions of law that explicitly prohibit or hinder the integration of reporting and other actions required under this Act.(Sec. 7) Provides that nothing in this Act: (1) changes any provision of Federal or State law or the obligation of any person to comply with any provision of law; (2) shall alter any person's obligation to provide information required under any reporting requirement; or (3) authorizes the Administrator to require the reporting of additional information or to prohibit the reporting of information currently reported.</summary>
