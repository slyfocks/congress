  <summary>2/2/1999--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Defense to permit persons who enroll in the TRICARE program (a managed health care program of the armed forces) to pay their annual enrollment fees on a monthly basis and to establish mechanisms to provide for payment of such fees through: (1) a deduction from military retired or retainer pay; (2) a deduction from monthly social security benefits; and (3) an electronic funds transfer from a checking or savings account. Requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security and the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct the Social Security deduction mechanism in the same manner as provided for the monthly deduction of Medicare premiums.</summary>
