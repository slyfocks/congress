Veterans' Employment and Training Bill of Rights Act of 1999 - Entitles the following covered persons to priority of services under any qualified employment training program if the person otherwise meets program eligibility requirements: (1) veterans who have a service-connected disability or who served on active duty in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; (2) the spouse of any person who died of a service-connected disability or who has a permanent total disability resulting from a service-connected disability; (3) the spouse of any member serving on active duty who is listed for more than 90 days as missing in action, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned by a foreign government or power; and (4) the spouse of a veteran who died while a permanent service-connected disability was in existence. Requires State and local entities that administer such programs to inform individuals of the availability of such services. (Sec. 3) Requires Federal contracts of $25,000 or more for the procurement of personal property and non-personal services to contain a provision under which the party receiving the contract agrees to take affirmative action to employ and advance qualified veterans who: (1) are disabled; (2) served on active duty during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or (3) while serving on active duty, participated in a U.S. military operation for which an armed forces service medal was awarded. (Sec. 4) Requires veterans qualifying under this Act to be given appropriate recruitment (currently, readjustment) appointments within the Federal Government. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide specified veterans' employment rights and benefits assistance to veterans qualifying under this Act. Provides for the filing, investigation, and determination of claims, by qualifying individuals, that an entity has failed to comply with hiring requirements of this Act. (Sec. 6) Authorizes the Secretary to allocate an additional ten full-time equivalent positions from the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor to the Veterans' Employment and Training Service to carry out work training and employment services for qualifying individuals.</summary>
