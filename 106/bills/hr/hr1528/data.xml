  <summary>4/22/1999--Introduced.
National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1999 - Amends the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 to revise requirements for the responsibilities of the U.S. Geological Survey with respect to the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, including to require the: (1) development of national priorities (currently, priorities) and standards; (2) development of a five-year strategic plan (currently, an implementation plan); (3) appointment of a new geologic mapping advisory committee; and (4) biennial submission of the report on the development and implementation of the program.Revises requirements for program components, including by: (1) including among the objectives of each component determining the geologic framework of areas determined to be vital to environmental welfare; (2) deleting provisions governing a geologic mapping support component and including interdisciplinary studies that add value to geologic mapping under the Federal geologic mapping component's responsibilities; (3) basing mapping priorities for the State geologic mapping component on State requirements for geologic map information in areas of multiple-issue need or of compelling single-issue need and in areas where mapping is required to solve critical earth science problems; (4) prohibiting the Survey and recipients of grants under the State or education component from using more than a specified percentage of the Federal funds made available under such component for any fiscal year to pay indirect, servicing, or program management charges; and (5) limiting to 50 percent the Federal share of the cost of activities under such components for any fiscal year.(Sec. 5) Revises provisions regarding the geologic mapping advisory committee, including by requiring such committee to update the five-year strategic plan.(Sec. 6) Sets forth requirements for the five- year strategic plan (similar to those for the implementation plan).(Sec. 7) Revises the provisions establishing the National geologic-map database, including by requiring that such database serve as a national catalog and archive (currently, archive), distributed through links to Federal and State geologic map holdings; and (2) provide for such database to include all maps developed under the Federal and education components (currently all maps developed pursuant to the Act).(Sec. 9) Authorizes appropriations. Allocates 48 percent of any amounts appropriated in excess of the amount appropriated for FY 2000 for the State component and two percent for the education component.</summary>
