Makes such exemption inapplicable to individuals employed as route sales drivers.(Sec. 4) Exempts licensed funeral directors and licensed embalmers from FLSA minimum wage and overtime compensation requirements.(Sec. 5) Allows a State to preempt the Federal minimum wage if the State: (1) sets a minimum wage rate of at least $5.15 per hour (the current Federal minimum wage); and (2) applies that rate to as many workers in the State as would otherwise be covered by the Federal minimum wage rate."
