Requires the establishment of two regional test projects, one of which shall be located at the Southern California Bight from Encinitas, Mexico, to Point Dume, California, with Orange County, California, serving as the focal point.Establishes a beach nourishment account in the Treasury to carry out: (1) such pilot program; and (2) projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and beach erosion control."
