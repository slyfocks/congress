    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Project Planning Title II: Mitigation Corps of Engineers Reform Act of 2000 - Title I: Project Planning - Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to direct the Secretary of the Army to ensure that feasibility reports for the following water resources projects are subject to review by an independent panel of experts established under this title: (1) projects with an estimated cost of more than $25 million, including mitigation costs; and (2) controversial projects, as defined under this title.Establishes in the Army Corps of Engineers an Office of Independent Review to review the projects covered under this title. Defines as controversial projects those which: (1) are subject to a substantial degree of public controversy; (2) the affected State objects to; or (3) the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determines are likely to have a significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife after taking into account any proposed mitigation plan. Limits to $250,000 the cost of a review, authorizing the Secretary to waive such limit for good cause shown.(Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to establish a stakeholder advisory group to assist the Secretary with the development of each feasibility study under this title and to enhance public participation in such study.(Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to monitor the economic and environmental results of each project having an estimated total cost of more than $25 million and to report annually to Congress on such project's performance.(Sec. 104) Prohibits the Secretary from recommending a plan for a proposed project until all project costs, including mitigation, have been calculated.(Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary to revise the principles and guidelines for flood control projects to: (1) incorporate a national ecological restoration account, a national economic development account, and an optimum trade-off plan to maximize account benefits; (2) incorporate new techniques in risk and uncertainty analysis; (3) eliminate biases and disincentives for nonstructural flood damage projects; (4) incorporate new analytical techniques; and (5) encourage the restoration of aquatic ecosystems.(Sec. 106) Requires the Corp's Environmental Advisory Board to review all water resource reconnaissance studies to assess whether a proposed project is likely to have environmental impacts that cannot be successfully mitigated and to make recommendations to the Secretary based on such review.Title II: Mitigation - Requires the submission of a plan which will fully mitigate (currently, only mitigate) fish and wildlife losses created by a project before the Secretary may propose the authorization of such project to Congress. Directs the Secretary, in such mitigation, to meet the highest standards typically required of private parties under related Federal programs and to acquire and restore at least an acre of habitat to replace each acre negatively impacted by the project. Prohibits the Secretary from recommending a project alternative unless the Secretary determines that the mitigation plan for the alternative project will cost-effectively and successfully mitigate all adverse impacts of such project on aquatic resources and fish and wildlife. Requires the Secretary to complete all planned mitigation in a particular watershed before constructing any new project in that watershed.(Sec. 202) Requires the Secretary, to ensure concurrent mitigation, to complete 50 percent of all required project mitigation before beginning project construction and to use a proportionate amount of project funding to complete such mitigation."
