Requires each such member to also have completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma or its equivalent by no later than the original ending date before such extension of duty. Limits to 36 months the period for such enhanced assistance, with a special rule for certain early separations. Requires the payment of educational expenses under such program, including 90 percent of the costs of tuition and fees, and reasonable costs of books, and other supplies. Requires such amounts to be considered income for purposes of eligibility for Federal educational loans or grants under the Higher Education Act of 1965. Provides: (1) a monthly stipend for approved programs of education, with different rates for programs pursued on a full-time, three quarter-time, or half-time basis; and (2) tutorial assistance. (Sec. 3) Repeals, with respect to such assistance: (1) a required monthly reduction in pay for individuals who do not elect to participate in such assistance program; and (2) a provision authorizing individuals to elect not to receive such assistance."
