Debt Forgiveness Act of 1999 - Prohibits funds appropriated in any Act from being obligated or made available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) until the President has: (1) canceled all amounts owed to the United States by heavily indebted poor countries (determined as such by the IMF and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for purposes of the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Debt Initiative) as a result of concessional and nonconcessional loans made, guarantees issued, or credits extended under any provision of law; and (2) certified to specified congressional committees that all such amounts have been canceled. Provides that a cancellation of debt shall not be considered to be assistance for purposes of any law limiting assistance to a country.</summary>
