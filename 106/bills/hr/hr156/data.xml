  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Declares that it shall not be considered unreasonable or unjust discrimination, or a violation of specified Federal transportation law, for the owner or operator of a certain category of reliever airport to deny access to a public charter air carrier with aircraft designed to carry more than nine passengers per flight. Limits the application of this Act to a reliever airport, without a specified kind of operating certificate, that is located within 25 miles of an airport that has: (1) at least 0.05 percent of the total annual boardings in the United States; and (2) current gate capacity to handle the demands of a public charter operation.</summary>
