TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Reducing the Reading Deficit Title II: Improving Literacy Through Family Literacy Projects; Reauthorization of Inexpensive Book Distribution Program Subtitle A: Family Literacy Subtitle B: Inexpensive Book Distribution Program Reading Deficit Elimination Act - Title I: Reducing the Reading Deficit - Reduces the total amount of Federal discretionary spending appropriated for a fiscal year by an amount that bears the same relation to 0.5 percent of the total amount of such spending for the preceding fiscal year as the total number of children enrolled in kindergarten through fourth grade in public elementary schools in States submitting requests for funds under this title bears to the total number of such children in all States. Reallots such Reading Enhancement and Achievement Disbursement (READ) funds to States to reduce the national reading deficit through the use of programs of reading instruction based on scientifically-based reading research, which includes a sequence of instruction in phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, reading fluency, spelling, writing, and reading comprehension strategies.(Sec. 103) Requires States to allocate 95 percent of such allotments to local educational agencies (LEAs) on the basis of relative numbers of such children, for use for teacher training, instructional materials, student assessment, teacher bonuses, and tuition assistance grants to parents or guardians to purchase tutoring.Repeals this title on the date that the National Assessment of Educational Progress publishes a notice certifying that the national reading deficit is less than five percent of the total number of children enrolled in grades kindergarten through fourth grade in the United States.Title II: Improving Literacy Through Family Literacy Projects; Reauthorization of Inexpensive Book Distribution Program - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise and reauthorize Even Start Family Literacy Programs (Even Start) (part B of title I provisions for Helping Disadvantaged Children Meet High Standards).(Sec. 201) Extends through FY 2004 the authorization of appropriations for such Even Start programs, and increases the amounts authorized.(Sec. 202) Requires State plans to assure that State educational agencies (SEAs) will encourage local educational agencies (LEAs) and individual schools participating in a program assisted under ESEA title I part A (Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies) to use part A funds to offer family literacy services, if the LEA or school determines that a substantial number of students served under part A have parents who do not have a secondary school diploma or its recognized equivalent, or who have low levels of literacy.(Sec. 203) Directs the Secretary of Education to: (1) reserve an increased portion of part B Even Start funds for migrant programs, outlying areas, and Indian tribes, under specified conditions; (2) award a competitive demonstration grant of sufficient amount and duration for a potentially high-quality family literacy program in a prison that houses women and their preschool age children; (3) ensure coordination of family literacy programs under Even Start with similar programs operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA); and (4) reserve specified portions of Even Start excess funds for scientifically-based research on family literacy by the National Institute for Literacy.Authorizes States to use a portion of Even Start funds to provide technical assistance and training to subgrantees (partnerships of LEAs and eligible organizations) to improve the quality of their family literacy services, giving priority to low-quality programs.Requires all such instructional staff, whose salaries are paid, in whole or in part, with Federal Even Start funds, within four years after enactment of this Act to: (1) have an associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree in a field related to early childhood education, elementary school education, or adult education; or (2) meet State-established qualifications for such types of education provided as part of an Even Start or other family literacy program. Requires all new instructional staff, beginning on the enactment of this Act, to meet one of those two requirements. Requires, within such four-year period, that: (1) all paraprofessionals whose salaries are paid with any Federal Even Start funds have at least a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent; and (2) the individual responsible for administrating each local Even Start program be trained in operating a family literacy program.Requires Even Start programs to: (1) use research-based techniques for helping children learn to read, as well as for helping adults where appropriate research is available; and (2) encourage participating families to attend regularly and remain in the program a sufficient time to meet their program goals.Allows an Even Start program, despite specified age limitations, to permit children eight years of age or older to participate, under certain conditions.Requires an SEA, in awarding subgrants to continue an Even Start program after the first year, to review the progress of each eligible entity in meeting program goals described in the State plan (as well as, under current law, evaluating the program based on State-developed program quality indicators).Eliminates the eight-year limitation on a subgrantee's receiving Even Start funds.Sets the same limits on the Federal share of renewed subgrants as on Even Start grants.Directs the National Institute for Literacy to use certain reserved Even Start funds for scientifically-based research to determine: (1) the most effective ways of improving literacy skills of adults with reading difficulties; and (2) how family literacy services can best provide parents with knowledge and skills to support their children's literacy development.Requires the Secretary, and any Even Start grantee or subgrantee, to treat religious organizations the same as other nongovernmental organizations for purposes of participating in eligible partnerships receiving or applying for such assistance, under specified conditions and limitations.Prohibits Even Start services from being provided through vouchers or certificates.(Sec. 204) Requires State applications for Even Start grants to describe how the State will encourage programs and projects assisted under Even Start to offer family literacy services, if the program or project serves a substantial number of migratory children with parents who do not have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent or who have low levels of literacy.(Sec. 205) Defines family literacy services under ESEA as services provided to participants on a voluntary basis that are of sufficient intensity in terms of hours, and of sufficient duration, to make sustainable changes in a family, and that integrate: (1) interactive literacy activities between parents and their children; (2) training for parents regarding how to be the primary teacher for their children and full partners in the education of their children; (3) parent literacy training that leads to economic self-sufficiency; and (4) an age-appropriate education to prepare children for success in school and life experiences.(Sec. 206) Amends the Education Amendments Act of 1978 to require BIA-operated family literacy programs, under the early childhood education program for Indian children or other programs, to be coordinated with Even Start family literacy programs under ESEA.Subtitle II: Inexpensive Book Distribution Program - Reauthorizes and revises the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, with respect to which the Secretary of Education contracts with Reading is Fundamental (RIF). Requires RIF to support and promote programs which include distribution of books to young and school-aged children that motivate them to read.(Sec. 211) Requires RIF also to provide training to subcontractors.Extends through FY 2004 the authorization of appropriations for such Program.Requires assisted local reading motivation programs to: (1) use Program assistance to provide books, training for volunteers, motivational activities, and other essential literary resources; and (2) give highest priority to serving the youngest and neediest children.Allows subcontractors operating such programs in low-income communities with substantial numbers or percentages of children with special needs to use funds from other Federal sources to pay up to one-half of the non-Federal share of funds used for acquiring and distributing books.Authorizes RIF, under specified conditions, to waive certain requirements for subcontractors and to enter into multi-year subcontracts.</summary>
