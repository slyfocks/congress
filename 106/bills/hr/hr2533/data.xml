  <summary>7/15/1999--Introduced.
Fairness in Telecommunications License Transfers Act of 1999 - Amends the Clayton Act to repeal the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to enforce provisions of such Act applicable to common carriers engaged in wire or radio communication or radio transmission of energy. Amends the Administrative Procedure Act to require each independent regulatory commission to promulgate rules of administrative practice and procedure for consideration in a reasonable time of all applications for the transfer of licenses, or the acquisition and operation of lines, for which the commission grants authority. Directs that such rules specify: (1) procedures for submitting to the covered parties requests for necessary documents and information; (2) the period following application for the commission to submit such requests or to approve or deny the application; (3) procedures limiting ex parte communications and requiring all ex parte communications to be placed in a public record; and (4) such other procedures as will ensure that the commission's processes for consideration of all transfer applications are fair, predictable, timely, open to public scrutiny, and subject to judicial review. Requires each independent regulatory commission to promulgate rules defining the terms "public interest," "public convenience and necessity," and "public interest, convenience, and necessity" as used in the statutes governing such proceedings. Specifies that if: (1) in considering an application for transfer, an independent regulatory commission does not comply with the rules such commission has promulgated, the application shall be deemed approved, without conditions; and (2) an independent regulatory commission has not promulgated rules as required by this Act, or has not followed such rules, any applicant affected by such failure may bring an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeking a declaration that the application is deemed approved, without conditions, by the commission.</summary>
