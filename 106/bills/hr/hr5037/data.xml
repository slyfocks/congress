  <summary>7/27/2000--Introduced.
Workplace Safety and Accountability Act - Amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA) to prohibit issuance of a citation for a violation of an OSHA standard unless the employer knew, or would have known by exercising due diligence, of the presence of the alleged violation.Prohibits such issuance if the employer demonstrates that the violation was caused by employees' failure to observe established work rules after such rules had been adequately communicated to them and they had been provided with proper training and equipment.Requires such a citation to be vacated if the employer demonstrates that employees were protected by alternative methods that were at least as protective as the standard in the factual circumstances.</summary>
