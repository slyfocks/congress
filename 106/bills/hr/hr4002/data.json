Urges the involvement of multilateral banks and U.S. and foreign nongovernmental organizations supporting extension and other productivity-enhancing programs in the international network of agricultural science in order to help agriculturally developing countries in international agricultural problem-solving efforts to prevent famine and hunger in such countries.Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to establish and carry out special programs as part of ongoing programs for child survival, democratization, development of free enterprise, environmental and natural resource management, and other related programs.(Sec. 4) Revises the duties of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development to include: (1) improving agricultural production, trade, and natural resource management in developing countries; and (2) with private organizations seeking to increase agricultural production and trade, natural resources management, and household food security in developing and transition countries."
