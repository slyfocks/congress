  <summary>10/4/2000--Passed Senate amended.
Famine Prevention and Freedom From Hunger Improvement Act of 2000 - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise congressional declarations of policy with respect to famine prevention and freedom from hunger in developing countries.(Sec. 2) Urges the United States, among other things, to: (1) generally engage the U.S. university community more extensively in the agricultural research, trade, and development initiatives undertaken outside the United States with the objectives of strengthening its capacity to carry out research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, processing, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally developing nations, and for transforming progress in global agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) into economic growth, trade, and trade benefits for aid recipient countries and U.S. communities and industries and for the wise use of natural resources; and (2) ensure that all federally funded support to universities and their public and private partners relating to the goals of this Act is periodically reviewed for its performance.Includes Native American land-grant colleges within the definition of "universities".(Sec. 3) Authorizes the President to provide U.S. foreign assistance for long-term program support for U.S. university global agricultural and related environmental collaborative research and learning opportunities for students, teachers, extension specialists, researchers, and the general public. Urges the involvement of multilateral banks and U.S. and foreign nongovernmental organizations supporting extension and other productivity-enhancing programs in the international network of agricultural science in order to help agriculturally developing countries in international agricultural problem-solving efforts to prevent famine and hunger in such countries.Directs the Administrator of the Agency for International Development to establish and carry out special programs as part of ongoing programs for child survival, democratization, development of free enterprise, environmental and natural resource management, and other related programs.(Sec. 4) Revises the duties of the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development to include: (1) improving agricultural production, trade, and natural resource management in developing countries; and (2) with private organizations seeking to increase agricultural production and trade, natural resources management, and household food security in developing and transition countries.</summary>
