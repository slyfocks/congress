Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century - Title I: Airport and Airway Improvements - Subtitle A: Funding - Amends Federal Aviation law to reauthorize through FY 2003: (1) the Airport Improvement Program (AIP); and (2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Facilities and Equipment Program. Earmarks specified amounts for: (1) the voluntary purchase and installation of universal access systems; (2) the Alaska National Air Space Interfacility Communications System; and (3) the implementation and use of upgrades to the current automated surface observation system-automated weather observing system (if the up-grade is successfully demonstrated). Directs the Administrator of the FAA to establish life-cycle cost estimates for any air traffic control modernization project whose costs equal or exceed $50 million.(Sec. 103) Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize appropriations for FAA operations through FY 2003. Makes specified allocations, including for: (1) wildlife hazard mitigation measures and management of the wildlife strike database of the FAA; and (2) a university consortium established to provide an air safety and security management certificate program.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 and thereafter for activities of the Office of Airline Information in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Department of Transportation (DOT).(Sec. 104). Revises the apportionment of airport improvement fund amounts to sponsors of primary airports and reliever and nonprimary (but excluding primary) commercial service airports and to the States in any fiscal year in which the total amount made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning projects is $3.2 billion or more (including cargo only airports in which the total amount for such projects is less than $3.2 billion).Authorizes the use of airport improvement funds apportioned to Alaska, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii for any of their public airports.Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to permit the use of State highway specifications for airfield pavement construction using airport improvement funds at nonprimary airports with runways of a certain length and serving certain aircraft, provided safety will not be negatively affected and the life of the pavement will not be shorter than it would be if constructed using FAA standards. Prohibits such airports from seeking airport improvement funds for runway rehabilitation or reconstruction of any airfield pavement constructed using State highway specifications for a period of ten years after construction is completed unless the Secretary determines that the rehabilitation or reconstruction is required for safety reasons. Authorizes the use of State-apportioned airport improvement funds for integrated airport system planning that encompasses one or more primary airports.Authorizes the use of the supplemental apportionment of airport improvement funds for Alaska for any of its public airports. Increases the apportionment for such airports in any fiscal year in which the total amount available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning projects is $3.2 billion or more.Increases the apportionment for airport improvement funds for airport noise compatibility programs.Repeals a certain limitation on the apportionment of airport improvement funds for commercial service airports in Alaska.(Sec. 105) Provides for an eligible agency to impose (in lieu of imposing the current passenger facility fee of $1, $2, or $3) a passenger facility fee of $4.00 or $4.50 on each airline passenger of a domestic or foreign air carrier boarding an aircraft at an airport the agency controls to finance an eligible airport-related project, provided certain conditions are met. Authorizes the approval of an agency application to impose a fee of more than $3.00 for an eligible surface transportation or terminal project, provided such agency has made adequate provision for financing the airside needs of the airport, including runways, taxiways, aprons, and aircraft gates.Revises provisions providing for the reduction of the apportionment of airport improvement fund amounts to a sponsor of an airport having at least .25 percent (and in certain cases more than .25 percent) of the total number of boardings each year in the United States and for which fees of $3.00 or less, or more than $3.00, is imposed in the fiscal year.(Sec. 106) Authorizes appropriations from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund through FY 2003 for: (1) aviation investment programs; and (2) the FAA Operations account.(Sec. 107) Provides for the increase, if any, for FY 2001 and thereafter of airport improvement fund amounts for the FAA for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs.(Sec. 108) Requires the Secretary to notify specified congressional committees of any proposed reprogramming of airport improvement funds.Subtitle B: Airport Development - Revises U.S. policies regarding aviation programs to encourage the funding and use of integrated in-pavement lighting systems for runways and taxiways and other runway and taxiway incursion prevention devices.(Sec. 121) Makes eligible for airport development project funds the installation of emergency call boxes, closed circuit weather surveillance equipment for airports in Alaska, windshear detection equipment, and stainless steel adjustable lighting extensions at public airports.(Sec. 123) Repeals the pavement maintenance pilot program.Makes routine work to preserve and extend the useful life of runways, taxiways, and aprons at nonprimary airports eligible for airport development project funds.(Sec. 124) Directs the FAA Administrator to enter into a cooperative research and development (R&amp;D) agreement to study and report to Congress the benefits of utilizing enhanced vision technologies to replace, enhance, or add to conventional airport approach and runway lighting systems. Treats such technologies as a navigation aid eligible for airport development projects funds.(Sec. 125) Requires the Secretary to provide public notice at least 30 days before modifying or waiving any aeronautical land use assurance or condition on the conveyance of land, including surplus property.(Sec. 126) Declares that the Government's share of costs shall be not more than 90 percent for airport improvement projects funded under the State block grant program.(Sec. 127) Prohibits the Secretary from requiring an eligible agency to impose a passenger facility fee in order to obtain a letter of intent with respect to airport development projects.(Sec. 128) Provides that the lesser of $15 million or 20 percent of small airport grant funds be set-aside for each of the next four fiscal years to assist sponsors of airports (not located in Alaska and which serve aircraft designed for more than nine but less than 31 passenger seats) in meeting the safety terms in airport operating certificates. Requires the Secretary to notify the grant recipient that the source of the grant is from the small airport fund. Requires the Secretary to give priority consideration to airport development projects to support operations by turbine-powered aircraft (if the non-Federal share of project costs is at least 40 percent) when making small airport fund grants to sponsors of public-use airports.(Sec. 129) Authorizes the Secretary to use certain unobligated funds to make discretionary grants for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning programs.(Sec. 130) Increases from 12 to 15 at any time the number of current or former military airports at any time that may receive airport improvement funds.Increases the amount of discretionary funds available to designated sponsors of current or former military airports to construct, improve, or repair airport terminal building facilities and airport surface parking lots, fuel farms, utilities, hangars, and air cargo terminals (50,000 square feet or less).(Sec. 131) Directs the Secretary to establish a pilot program to contract for air traffic control services at Level I air traffic control towers that do not qualify for the Contract Tower Program. Sets forth specified program requirements. Authorizes appropriations.Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to not more than two airport sponsors for the construction of a low-level activity visual flight rule (level 1) air traffic control tower. Specifies grant requirements. Limits to $1.1 million the Federal share of construction costs of an air traffic control tower.(Sec. 132) Authorizes the Secretary to approve not more than 20 projects in which airport improvement grant funds may be used for innovative financing techniques for development projects at airports that each have less than .25 percent of the total number of passenger boardings each year at all commercial service airports.(Sec. 133) Directs the Secretary to carry out an inherently low-emission airport vehicle pilot program which makes grants to the sponsors of not more than ten public-use airports eligible for airport development assistance. Makes a public-use airport eligible for such assistance if it is located in an air quality nonattainment area; although if there is a shortage of applicants from nonattainment areas, allows the Secretary to consider applications from public-use airports that are not located in such areas. Directs the Secretary, in selecting an applicant sponsor for a grant, to give priority consideration to applicants that achieve the greatest air quality benefits measured by the amount of emission reduced per dollar of grant funds.(Sec. 134) Directs the Secretary to carry out not less than one project to test and evaluate innovative aviation security systems and related technology to improve security at U.S. public airports. Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 135) Prohibits the collection of a passenger facility fee from a passenger: (1) on flights, including flight segments, between two or more points in Hawaii; or (2) in Alaska aboard an aircraft having a seating capacity of less than 60 passengers.Permits certain regulations to authorize a public agency to request waiver of a passenger facility fee for: (1) any class of domestic or foreign air carrier that enplanes not more than one percent of the total number of passengers enplaned annually at an airport; or (2) passengers enplaned on a flight to an airport with scheduled passenger service but fewer than 2,5000 passenger boardings each year, and in a community with a population of less than 10,000 and not connected by land to the National Highway System. Prohibits a State (or political subdivision) that is not the eligible agency from taxing, regulating, or prohibiting or otherwise attempting to control, the imposition or collection of a passenger facility fee or the use of the revenue from such fee.Declares that an airport development project shall remain eligible for funding from the discretionary fund (subject to the availability of funds) even though the airport's status changes from a primary to a nonprimary airport or a commercial service airport to a noncommercial service airport.(Sec. 136) Requires any Federal, executive branch department, agency, or instrumentality to grant priority to a request by a public agency (except another Federal executive branch department, agency, or instrumentality) for surplus property (with specified exceptions) for use at a public airport.(Sec. 137) Amends Federal aviation law to make it policy to encourage the development of intermodal connections on airport property between aeronautical and other transportation modes and systems to serve air transportation passengers and cargo efficiently and effectively and promote economic development. Makes eligible for airport development project funds the constructing, reconstructing, or improving of an airport, or purchase of nonrevenue generating capital equipment for an airport, for the purpose of transferring passengers, cargo, or baggage between the aeronautical and ground transportation modes on airport property.(Sec. 138) Increases from nine to ten the number of qualified States that may be designated for each fiscal year to assume administrative responsibility for amounts available under the State block grant program (except amounts designated for use at primary airports).(Sec. 139) Authorizes the Administrator of the FAA to establish a pilot program under which design-build contracts may be used to carry out of up to seven projects at U.S. airports with airport improvement grants.Subtitle C: Miscellaneous - Treats as an eligible airport-related project with respect to which an eligible agency may impose a passenger facility fee: (1) in the case of a project to enable additional air service by an air carrier with less than 50 percent of the annual passenger boardings at an airport, the construction, with respect to gates and related areas at which passengers board or exit an aircraft, of structural foundations and floor systems, exterior building walls and load-bearing interior columns or walls, windows, door and roof systems, and building utilities (including heating, air conditioning, ventilation, plumbing, and electrical service), and aircraft fueling facilities adjacent to such gates; and (2) the costs of terminal development at an airport that did not have more than .25 percent of the total U.S. annual passenger boardings and at which total passenger boardings declined by at least 16 percent between 1989 and 1997.(Sec. 152) Requires the Secretary to determine whether or not a public airport is a commercial service airport on the basis of the number of passenger boardings and type of air service at such airport when determining whether discretionary funds may be distributed to such commercial service airport.(Sec. 153) Extends the instrument landing system (ILS) program through FY 2002.(Sec. 154) Authorizes the Secretary to make noise compatibility grants to airport operators for projects to mitigate the effects of noise primarily caused by military aircraft.(Sec. 155) Prohibits the approval of a passenger facility fee or the award of an airport improvement grant for an eligible airport, or an eligible agency from imposing such a fee with respect to an airport, unless the airport or agency submits a competition plan which includes information on the availability of airport gates and related facilities, gate-use requirements, patterns of air service, gate assignment policy, and other airport-related information. Requires the Secretary to ensure that gates and other facilities are made available at fair and reasonable costs to air carriers at eligible airports where a "majority-in-interest clause" of a contract inhibits the ability of the local airport authority to provide or build new gates or other facilities.(Sec. 156) Requires the Administrator of the FAA, in amending certain Federal regulations, to: (1) consider the extent to which Alaska is not served by transportation modes other than aviation; and (2) establish appropriate regulatory distinctions.Directs the Administrator of the FAA and the Assistant Administrator of the National Weather Service to continue to develop and implement a "mike-in-hand" weather observation program in Alaska in which FAA, National Weather Service, or other Federal or State employees provide near-real time aviation weather information via radio to pilots who request it.(Sec. 157) Directs the FAA Administrator to study and report to Congress on the long term physical performance, safety implications, and environmental benefits of using recycled materials (including recycled pavements, waste materials, and byproducts) in aviation pavement.
