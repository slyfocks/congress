    "text": "Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century - Title I: Airport and Airway Improvements - Subtitle A: Funding - Amends Federal Aviation law to reauthorize through FY 2003: (1) the Airport Improvement Program (AIP); and (2) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Facilities and Equipment Program. Earmarks specified amounts for: (1) the voluntary purchase and installation of universal access systems; (2) the Alaska National Air Space Interfacility Communications System; and (3) the implementation and use of upgrades to the current automated surface observation system-automated weather observing system (if the up-grade is successfully demonstrated). Directs the Administrator of the FAA to establish life-cycle cost estimates for any air traffic control modernization project whose costs equal or exceed $50 million.(Sec. 103) Amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to authorize appropriations for FAA operations through FY 2003. Makes specified allocations, including for: (1) wildlife hazard mitigation measures and management of the wildlife strike database of the FAA; and (2) a university consortium established to provide an air safety and security management certificate program.Authorizes appropriations for FY 2001 and thereafter for activities of the Office of Airline Information in the Bureau of Transportation Statistics of the Department of Transportation (DOT).(Sec. 104). Revises the apportionment of airport improvement fund amounts to sponsors of primary airports and reliever and nonprimary (but excluding primary) commercial service airports and to the States in any fiscal year in which the total amount made available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning projects is $3.2 billion or more (including cargo only airports in which the total amount for such projects is less than $3.2 billion).Authorizes the use of airport improvement funds apportioned to Alaska, Puerto Rico, or Hawaii for any of their public airports.Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to permit the use of State highway specifications for airfield pavement construction using airport improvement funds at nonprimary airports with runways of a certain length and serving certain aircraft, provided safety will not be negatively affected and the life of the pavement will not be shorter than it would be if constructed using FAA standards. Prohibits such airports from seeking airport improvement funds for runway rehabilitation or reconstruction of any airfield pavement constructed using State highway specifications for a period of ten years after construction is completed unless the Secretary determines that the rehabilitation or reconstruction is required for safety reasons. Authorizes the use of State-apportioned airport improvement funds for integrated airport system planning that encompasses one or more primary airports.Authorizes the use of the supplemental apportionment of airport improvement funds for Alaska for any of its public airports. Increases the apportionment for such airports in any fiscal year in which the total amount available for airport planning and development and noise compatibility planning projects is $3.2 billion or more.Increases the apportionment for airport improvement funds for airport noise compatibility programs.Repeals a certain limitation on the apportionment of airport improvement funds for commercial service airports in Alaska.(Sec. 105) Provides for an eligible agency to impose (in lieu of imposing the current passenger facility fee of $1, $2, or $3) a passenger facility fee of $4.00 or $4.50 on each airline passenger of a domestic or foreign air carrier boarding an aircraft at an airport the agency controls to finance an eligible airport-related project, provided certain conditions are met.
