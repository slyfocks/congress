Prohibits the FCC from enforcing or reimposing such cap after such date.Prohibits the FCC from: (1) enforcing individual caps imposed on carriers by orders of the FCC entered in connection with prior requests for study area waivers; or (2) imposing any new cap that would limit the per loop support calculated under current FCC regulations.Requires the FCC to calculate: (1) that portion of the high cost support mechanism attributable to loops having costs in excess of 115 percent of the nationwide average; and (2) the nationwide average unseparated loop cost, taking into account the elimination of the interim cap pursuant to this Act."
