Requires the Secretary to ensure that funded projects are not inconsistent with watershed protection and environmental restoration efforts being carried out under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act or the CALFED Bay-Delta Program. Directs the Secretary to require that the District and cooperating non-Federal agencies or organizations pay: (1) 25 percent of project construction costs; (2) 100 percent of project operation, maintenance, and replacement and rehabilitation costs; and (3) 35 percent of planning, design, and environmental compliance activity costs.Permits funds appropriated pursuant to this Act to be made available to fund 65 percent of costs incurred for planning, design, and environmental compliance activities by the District or by local agencies in accordance with agreements with the Secretary, under which the District or local agency is required to pay the non-Federal share of construction costs and which governs the funding of planning, design, and compliance activities costs.Authorizes specified expenditures within existing budget authority to carry out this Act."
