  <summary>9/21/2000--Introduced.
Alien Children Protection Act of 2000 - Requires, with exceptions, an alien under the age of 18 who does not have an adult relative or guardian in the United States to be placed in a facility appropriate for children (as defined in this Act) while he or she is awaiting final immigration status adjudication.Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the Attorney General to adjust the status of an alien under the age of 18 with no lawful immigration status to that of a permanent resident alien if: (1) the alien or parent or guardian has so applied, and the alien has resided in the United States for five consecutive years; or (2) no foreign-domiciled parent or guardian has requested the alien's return, and the Attorney General determines that a return would subject the alien to physical or mental abuse, and it is in the alien's best interests to remain in the United States. Limits the annual number of such status adjustments.Directs the Attorney General to appoint a child welfare professional or trained individual as such alien's guardian ad litem.Expresses the sense of Congress commending the Immigration and Naturalization Service for issuance and implementation of specified children's asylum claims guidelines.Directs the General Accounting Office to report with respect to U.S. embassy and consular efforts to reunify on a priority basis children in foreign countries with parents who are legally present in the United States.</summary>
