  <summary>5/18/1999--Introduced.
United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act - Amends the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act to accord, for a specified transition period, the same preferential tariff and quota treatment (lower tariffs or duty-free treatment, free of quantitative restrictions) given certain textile and apparel articles imported from North American Free Trade countries to such articles from U.S.-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act (CBTEA) beneficiary countries which have demonstrated commitments to: (1) undertake their obligations under the World Trade Organization on or ahead of schedule; (2) participate in negotiations toward completion of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (or comparable trade agreement); or (3) undertake other steps necessary for their accession to the FTAA or comparable trade agreement. Directs the President to report periodically to Congress concerning CBTEA beneficiary countries. Directs the United States International Trade Commission to report triennially to Congress and the President on the economic impact of this Act on U.S. industries and consumers, including its effectiveness in promoting drug-related crop eradication and crop substitution efforts of the CBTEA beneficiary countries. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report triennially to Congress on the impact this Act has with respect to U.S. labor (including developments in labor conditions in the CBTEA beneficiary countries). Authorizes the President to determine that a country is not providing adequate protection of intellectual property rights under its laws, even if it is in compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.</summary>
