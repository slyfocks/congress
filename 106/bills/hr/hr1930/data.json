    "text": "Prisoner Web Site Disclosure Act of 1999 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit a person from offering, by means of the World Wide Web, to provide any communication with an incarcerated individual unless such offer also contains notice, clearly and conspicuously, of: (1) the crime(s) for which such individual is incarcerated; and (2) the earliest date on which such individual may be released. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to telecommunications carriers and other telecommunications service providers. Provides civil penalties. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to make widely available information designed to inform the public regarding the above prohibition, and to make such information available on the World Wide Web site of the FCC and in such other manners as determined appropriate."
