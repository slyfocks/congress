Allows amounts in the escrow account to be applied toward the payment of any fine or penalty. Requires the FEC to return escrow account deposits to the person making the contribution or donation if the FEC, within 180 days of the date the transfer was made, does not seek additional information regarding a possible violation, and certain other requirements are met.(Sec. 304) Establishes alternative procedures for the imposition of penalties by the FEC for reporting violations involving receipts and disbursements.(Sec. 305) Abolishes the ex officio membership of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate on the FEC.(Sec. 306) Makes it unlawful for a separate segregated fund to cause another person to make a contribution or expenditure by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat thereof.(Sec. 307) Allows the issuance of subpoenas and notifications of intent to seek additional information with the signature of any member of the FEC, not just the chairman or vice chairman.Title IV: Simplifying and Clarifying Federal Election Law - Amends FECA to do the following: (1) repeal the requirement under limitations on contributions and expenditures that, for purposes of the ban on individual contributions aggregating more than $25,000 in any calendar year, any contribution made to a candidate in a year other than the calendar year in which the election is held with respect to which such contribution is made is considered to be made during the calendar year in which such election is held; (2) exempts from the definition of contribution candidate loans based on lines of credit if such loan is made in accordance with applicable law and under commercially reasonable terms and in the normal course of business; (3) repeal requirements under limitations on contributions and expenditures that the Secretary of Commerce report voting age population of each congressional district; (4) require price index and estimated voting age population information to be certified to the FEC and published in the Federal Register by February 15 of each year; and (5) delete honoraria as an exemption from the definition of contribution.Title V: Effective Date - Sets forth the effective date of this Act."
