Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act, with respect to disability determinations, to repeal the restriction to blind individuals of the requirement for a specified minimum level of earnings for demonstrating ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. (Thus applies to all OASDI eligible persons a uniform minimum level of earnings for demonstrating such ability at the level currently applicable solely to blind individuals.)</summary>
