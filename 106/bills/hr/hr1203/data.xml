  <summary>3/18/1999--Introduced.
IMF Transparency and Efficiency Enforcement Act of 1999 - Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to limit the Secretary of the Treasury's authority to make loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by providing that such loans can only be made within one year after the Secretary and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System have jointly certified to specified congressional committees that the Fund has implemented certain transparency and efficiency policies with respect to its operations. States that if, in each of the preceding four years, such certification has been made but a joint resolution approving it has not been enacted into law, then such loans may not be made within one year after the certification unless, during such year, a joint resolution approving it is so enacted.</summary>
