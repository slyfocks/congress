  <summary>7/19/1999--Introduced.
Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1999 - Amends the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) to prohibit a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group coverage, from discriminating in eligibility based on a request for, or receipt of, genetic information or a genetic test. Prohibits such entities from: (1) using genetic information to discriminate in issuance, renewal, premium rates, or benefits; or (2) disclosing or being compelled, by subpoena or any other means, subject to exception, to disclose genetic information about an individual unless authorized by the individual. Amends the Public Health Service Act to apply these prohibitions to coverage in the individual market.Amends Federal law relating to veterans' benefits to mandate standards, consistent with the prohibitions in this Act, regarding genetic information use and disclosure in connection with medical care provided under those provisions.Makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to attempt to acquire, acquire, or use genetic information, or to require a genetic test, of an employee or applicant to discriminate or restrict any right or benefit. Prohibits employer disclosure of and access to genetic information without the employee's prior written consent. Provides for enforcement through the powers, remedies, and procedures in specified provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Requires a report by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to the Congress regarding standards to provide increased protection for the collection, storage, and use of DNA samples and genetic information.</summary>
