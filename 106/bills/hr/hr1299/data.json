Applies such provision retroactively to the 1999 commodity crops. (Sec. 3) Authorizes up to six-month marketing loan extensions. (Sec. 4) Amends the Food Security Act of 1985, with respect to the conservation reserve program, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) consider for enrollment purposes crops typically grown on eligible land that will reduce excess productivity and improve crop prices; (2) increase enrolled acreage; and (3) provide for early acreage release in certain cases of foreign displacement of U.S. commodities. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of Congress that Federal restrictions on foreign sales of U.S. commodities should be maintained only if essential to national security. Directs the President to conduct an annual review of such restrictions."
