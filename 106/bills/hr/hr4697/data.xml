  <summary>7/25/2000--Passed House amended.
International Anti-Corruption and Good Governance Act of 2000 - Revises U.S. policy with respect to the provision of development assistance to foreign countries to require the President in assessing the commitment and progress of a country to use such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of its poor to utilize certain criteria, including but not limited to, progress in combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability in the public and private sector.Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require technical assistance provided by a certain program to foreign governments and foreign central banks of developing or transitional countries also to include elements designed to combat anti-competitive, unethical, and corrupt activities, including protection against actions that may distort or inhibit transparency in market mechanisms and, to the extent applicable, privatization procedures.Authorizes the President to establish programs that combat corruption, improve transparency and accountability, and promote other forms of good governance in developing countries or countries eligible to receive assistance under the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989. Requires the President to give priority to establishing programs in countries that received a significant amount of U.S. foreign assistance for the prior fiscal year, or in which the United States has a significant economic interest, and that continue to have the most persistent problems with public and private corruption. Requires the President to report to specified congressional committees with respect to such programs. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
