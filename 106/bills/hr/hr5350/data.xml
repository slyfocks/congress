  <summary>10/2/2000--Introduced.
Children's Protection Act of 2000 - Exempts from Federal antitrust laws any collaborative efforts by or among persons in the entertainment industry to develop and disseminate voluntary guidelines designed to: (1) alleviate the negative impact of television, movies, video games, Internet content, and music lyrics containing violence, sexual content, criminal behavior, or other subjects that the entertainment industry deems appropriate for children; or (2) promote telecast material that is educational, informational, or otherwise beneficial to the development of children. States that such exemption shall not apply to any efforts which: (1) result in a boycott of any person; or (2) concern the purchase or sale of advertising.Requires a report from the Attorney General to Congress on the extent to which: (1) the motion picture, recording, and television industry have developed or enforced guidelines to ensure compliance with ratings or labeling systems which identify and limit the dissemination of sexual, violent, or other indecent material to children; and (2) Federal and State antitrust laws preclude those industries from developing and enforcing such guidelines.</summary>
