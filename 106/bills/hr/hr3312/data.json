Allows ADR services only upon joint request of the employee and agency. Directs the Board to test and evaluate a variety of ADR techniques. Authorizes the Board to establish an early intervention ADR process, upon joint request of both parties, after an agency has issued a notice letter of proposed action to an employee but before an appeal is filed with the Board. Makes consent to early intervention confidential, and allows either party to withdraw at any time. Authorizes the Board to resolve matters ancillary to the dispute. Requires the Board to develop a training and credentialing program to ensure that program neutrals have a sufficient understanding of issues that arise during the ADR process.Requires the Board's Office of Policy and Evaluation to establish criteria for evaluating the ADR program and to prepare a report as to whether mandatory ADR is desirable, effective, and appropriate for cases decided by Federal agencies.Authorizes appropriations.(Sec. 4) Establishes within the Board the Administrative Judge Pay Schedule, with pay levels comparable to that of other Federal administrative law judges. Authorizes conversion to such Pay Schedule for current Board judges after they have served in such capacity for at least three years. Outlines provisions for advancement within the Pay Schedule, as well as transition provisions for current judges. Authorizes appropriations to carry out such Schedule."
