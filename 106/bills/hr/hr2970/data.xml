  <summary>9/29/1999--Introduced.
Rongelap Resettlement Act of 1999 - Declares that the "Agreement Regarding United States Assistance in the Resettlement of Rongelap Concluded Between the United States Department of the Interior and Rongelap Atoll Local Government" dated September 19, 1996, as amended, shall continue to remain in effect. Extends the authority to make certain disbursements under such Agreement for a period of ten years after it terminates. Provides that such disbursements are: (1) subject to the percentum limitation set forth in the Agreement; (2) used by the Rongelap Atoll local government to manage and support community reunification, recovery, and mobilization for resettlement for the dislocated populations at Majuro, Ebeye, Mejatto, and elsewhere in the Marshall Islands; and (3) subject to the Secretary of the Interior's disapproval based upon a determination that a particular use of funds does not effectively contribute to resettlement or address conditions of dislocation.</summary>
