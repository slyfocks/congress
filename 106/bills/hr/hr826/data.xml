  <summary>2/24/1999--Introduced.
National Weather Service Flexible Work Scheduling Act - Provides an overtime hourly rate of pay of one and one-half times the hourly rate of basic pay and provides that all such pay is premium pay for an employee of the National Weather Service who occupies a nonmanagerial position in GS-14 or under: (1) the duties of which are essential to the immediate daily operation of the forecast and warning responsibilities of the Service and directly affect public and aviation safety; (2) in which overtime work is usually unscheduled due to the vicissitudes of severe weather; and (3) in which overtime work is therefore unusually taxing. Exempts such an employee from the limitation on aggregate pay, including premium pay, for a pay period. Provides for a National Weather Service employee, who works during a regularly scheduled eight-hour period of service a part of which is performed on Sunday, to be paid at his or her basic pay rate, plus premium pay at a rate equal to 25 percent of his or her basic pay rate with respect to that portion of such period of service which is performed on Sunday. Directs the Office of Personnel Management to provide for the rounding of any fraction of an hour of service performed on Sunday to the next highest whole number, with offsetting rounding in non-Sunday service so that the total service for the period involved remains the same.</summary>
