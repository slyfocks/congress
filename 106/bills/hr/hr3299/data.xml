Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act of 1999 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require at least five percent of the drug control program funds provided to a State to be reserved for distribution to law enforcement agencies to establish an administrative process which requires that a law enforcement agency that investigates a law enforcement officer for matters which could lead to disciplinary action (including dismissal, demotion, suspension, or transfer) provide recourse for such officer that includes access to the administrative process prior to the imposition of disciplinary action, as well as the right to a hearing, representation, and the confronting of witnesses.Authorizes the immediate suspension of an officer: (1) whose continued presence is considered a substantial and immediate threat to the welfare of such agency or the public; (2) who refuses to obey a direct order issued to conform with the agency's written and disseminated rules and regulations; or (3) who is accused of committing an illegal act.Exempts from this Act an employing agency that has in effect an established system, board, or procedure which meets or exceeds such minimum standards.</summary>
