Requires, in the scheduling of launches at a U.S. Government launch site, that private sector launches be provided the greatest possible access to launch opportunities at the earliest possible dates. Directs the Secretary of Transportation to facilitate and encourage the acquisition by the private sector and State governments of Federal property and services, including utilities, for the support of commercial space launch efforts. Requires, at least 30 days before any property is acquired, for the head of an agency from which the property is to be acquired to provide public notice of the proposed acquisition."
