  <summary>5/2/2000--Introduced.
Requires National Guard military technicians (dual status) who are: (1) eligible at the time dual status is lost to an unreduced retirement annuity to be separated no later than 30 days after such status is lost; and (2) not eligible to an unreduced annuity at such time to be offered the opportunity to either reapply for a dual status position or apply for a civil service position that is not a technician position. Provides mandatory retirement for such technicians who continue employment as a non-dual status technician. States that a technician shall be considered to lose dual status upon: (1) being separated from the Selected Reserve; or (2) ceasing to hold the military grade specified for the technician position held. Provides separation and retirement requirements identical to those above for non-dual status National Guard technicians.</summary>
