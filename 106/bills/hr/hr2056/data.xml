Authorizes the President to restore nondiscriminatory treatment of the products of: (1) Lebanon after certifying to Congress that the Syrian military, security, and intelligence forces and their proxies there have completely withdrawn and that Lebanon's Government has been democratically and freely elected; and (2) Syria after certifying to Congress that such withdrawal has taken place and the Syrian Government has been democratically and freely elected.Prohibits, unless the requirements of this Act have been met, the provision of: (1) economic assistance to Syria or Lebanon; or (2) military assistance to Lebanon. Expresses the sense of Congress that any assistance so prohibited should be redirected for humanitarian, democracy building, human rights, and educational efforts in Lebanon. Directs the President to instruct the U.S. representative to each international financial institution to vote to oppose the initiation or renewal of any loan or other form of assistance for Syria or Lebanon unless the requirements of this Act have been met.Requires the Secretary of State, as part of the annual report to Congress concerning the human rights situation in countries proposed to receive security assistance, to pay special attention to the report on Lebanon by including: (1) an assessment of Syrian influence on the Lebanese Government and human rights abuses attributable to such influence; (2) an assessment of the role played by Syrian intelligence services there; (3) progress made by the Lebanese Government in disarming terrorist groups; and (4) specific steps taken by the State Department to affect the withdrawal of Syrian forces and their proxies from Lebanon.</summary>
