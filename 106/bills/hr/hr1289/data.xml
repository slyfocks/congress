Tobacco Use Prevention and Public Health Act of 1999 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to prohibit as the treatment of an overpayment for Medicaid-related purposes any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of a settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by the State against one or more manufacturers of tobacco products (recovered amounts), if (and to the extent that), with respect to such recovered amounts in a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) finds that specified conditions will be met, including that the State will use at least 25 percent of recovered amounts for a fiscal year on: (1) specified tobacco control activities, including certain tobacco use reduction activities such as tobacco use cessation programs and school-based and child-oriented education programs to discourage tobacco use, as well as the enforcement of laws relating to tobacco products; and (2) health activities, including public health activities, which include State expenditures for outreach activities. Includes further among such activities: (1) tobacco-related research concerning nicotine addiction; and (2) activities to assist tobacco farmers and workers and communities as they transition to a more broadly diversified economy. Creates the National Tobacco Use Prevention Program (NTUPP), composed of various specified HHS and Department of Agriculture (DOA) subprogram and public awareness campaign components. Includes subprograms to reduce tobacco use by minorities (HHS) and to provide economic stabilization for tobacco farmers (DOA) within NTUPP. Establishes in the Treasury the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account, subject to a specified fiscal year adjustment.</summary>
