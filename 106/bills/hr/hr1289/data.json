Includes further among such activities: (1) tobacco-related research concerning nicotine addiction; and (2) activities to assist tobacco farmers and workers and communities as they transition to a more broadly diversified economy. Creates the National Tobacco Use Prevention Program (NTUPP), composed of various specified HHS and Department of Agriculture (DOA) subprogram and public awareness campaign components. Includes subprograms to reduce tobacco use by minorities (HHS) and to provide economic stabilization for tobacco farmers (DOA) within NTUPP. Establishes in the Treasury the National Tobacco Use Prevention Account, subject to a specified fiscal year adjustment."
