  <summary>7/10/2000--Reported to House amended.
Secure Our Schools Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to States, local governments, and Indian tribes to provide improved security at public elementary or secondary schools and on school grounds, including through the use of metal detectors and other deterrent measures.Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) permissible uses of funds (including for locks, lighting, and security assessments and training), preferential consideration, matching funds (limits costs to 50 percent but authorizes the Attorney General to provide guidelines for waiving or altering such requirement in cases of financial need), equitable geographical distribution of funds, and limits on administrative costs; and (2) application and reporting requirements.Requires that each grant application be accompanied by an assurance that it was prepared after consultation with individuals not limited to law enforcement officers (such as school violence researchers, child psychologists, social workers, teachers, principals, and other school personnel) to ensure that the improvements to be funded are consistent with a comprehensive approach to preventing school violence and are individualized to the needs of each school.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
