    "text": "Public Safety and Community Policing Renewal Grants Act of 1999 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to: (1) reauthorize and increase appropriations for the public safety and community policing (\"cops on the beat\") program for FY 2000; and (2) reauthorize appropriations through FY 2005. (Sec. 3) Repeals provisions of such Act regarding a decrease of the Federal share of matching funds and termination of grants for hiring officers. (Sec. 4) Rewrites provisions regarding grant renewal to provide that such a grant made: (1) prior to this Act's enactment date for hiring or rehiring additional career law enforcement officers or to promote redeployment of officers by hiring civilians may be renewed for an additional three-year period beginning on the first day of the fiscal year that begins after the date of this Act's enactment; and (2) after that date for such hiring or rehiring may also be renewed for an additional three-year period. Directs that: (1) the Attorney General give preferential consideration for grant awards to recipients who used funds awarded prior to enactment to increase the number of law enforcement officers interacting directly with members of the community; and (2) the renewal grant amount received each year be increased to reflect a three percent cost of living increase, subject to appropriations. Repeals a provision regarding multi-year grants. (Sec. 5) Repeals requirements that grant applications specify plans for: (1) obtaining necessary support and continuing the proposed program, project, or activity following the conclusion of Federal support; and (2) the assumption by the applicant of a progressively larger share of the cost in the course of time, looking toward the continuation of the increased hiring level using State or local sources of funding following the conclusion of Federal support, if the application is for a grant for hiring or rehiring additional career law enforcement officers. (Sec. 6) Allows grant funds to be made available to States or local governments to be used to supplant State or local (or in the case of Indian tribal governments, Bureau of Indian Affairs-supplied) funds, with respect to grants under this Act. Repeals a $75,000 cap on funding for hiring or rehiring a career law enforcement officer."
