  <summary>4/27/1999--Passed House amended.
Declares the portion of the James River and Kanawha Canal in Richmond, Virginia, between the Great Ship Lock on the east and the limits of the city of Richmond on the west, to be a non-navigable waterway of the United States for purposes of Federal vessel safety standards. Requires the Secretary of Transportation to provide such technical advice, information, and assistance as the city may request to insure that vessels operating on such waters are built, maintained, and operated in a manner consistent with protecting public safety. Allows the Secretary to terminate such declaration by publishing a determination that vessels operating on such waters have not been built, maintained, and operated in such a manner. Requires the Secretary, before making a determination, to: (1) consult with State and local officials regarding whether such a determination is necessary to protect public safety and will serve the public interest; and (2) provide to persons who might be adversely affected an opportunity for comment and a hearing.</summary>
