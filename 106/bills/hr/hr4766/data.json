    "text": "Classroom Modernization Act of 2000 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to revise and rename title XII as Classroom Modernization. (Currently it is named School Facilities Infrastructure Improvement, or the Education Infrastructure Act of 1994.)Directs the Secretary of Education to make formula grants to States to assist local educational agencies (LEAs) with the expenses of complying with Federal education statutory requirements and priorities relating to infrastructure, technology, and equipment needs for public elementary and secondary schools, including charter schools and schools on or near Indian lands. Bases State allotments on: (1) relative numbers of children age five through 17 from families with incomes below poverty; and (2) relative proportions of ESEA title I allotments. Requires reservation of specified funds for grants to account for children residing on Indian lands.Requires States to distribute such funds to LEAs or consortia of LEAs, through forms consistent with State law for school infrastructure financing, including grants, loans, and aid to issue bonds or other obligations. Considers as such distributed amounts: (1) aid to refund or refinance outstanding obligations; and (2) amounts used to establish a reserve fund for State loan guarantee program. Allows any State that establishes such a program including a loan guarantee for at least one charter school to use a specified portion of grant funds to administer such program.Sets forth objective data categories which a State may consider in determining distribution of such funds. Sets the Federal share at 100 percent for: (1) renovation, construction, acquisition, and start-up needs related to the building infrastructure of a charter school (or, in the case of schools on Indian lands, renovation and construction needs related to building infrastructure); (2) school facilities modifications necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; (3) purchase, lease, or other acquisition of assistive technology devices for children with disabilities; (4) asbestos abatement or removal from school facilities; and (5) ancillary renovation to complete such projects.Sets the Federal share at 50 percent for: (1) school facility wiring and associated infrastructure improvements that enhance students' academic experiences and are necessary for use of the Internet or related emerging technologies or better equip schools for modern educational technologies; (2) science laboratories and equipment, and vocational education laboratories and equipment, that are of significant cost or are related to emerging technologies; (3) school facility renovations undertaken for compliance with fire and safety codes; (4) school facilities renovations to prevent traumatic crisis events on school property that would disrupt the learning environment, such as school shootings or other major acts of violence, if the renovations are undertaken in direct response to, or in anticipation of, such events; and (5) ancillary renovation to complete such projects.Authorizes appropriations.Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on the impact of Federal conditions of aid on school construction projects."
