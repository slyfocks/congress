  <summary>9/21/2000--Introduced.
Declares that, if the Secretary of Health and Human Services changes regulations under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to permit certified registered nurse anesthetists to furnish anesthesia services in hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers without medical supervision, then the level of payment for such services furnished by a certified registered nurse anesthetist who is not medically supervised in such a hospital or center shall be the same as the level of payment for such services furnished by the anesthetist in such a facility when the anesthetist is medically supervised.</summary>
