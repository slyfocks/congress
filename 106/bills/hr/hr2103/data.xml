  <summary>6/9/1999--Introduced.
Family and Medical Leave Enhancement Act - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to expand the Act's coverage by reducing from 50 to 25 the threshold minimum number of employees of an employer necessary to apply the Act. Allows employees covered by FMLA to take up to four hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to participate in or attend their children's educational and extracurricular activities. Amends Federal civil service law to apply the same parental involvement leave allowance to Federal employees. Provides that leave under FMLA may be taken to meet: (1) routine family medical needs, including transportation of children for medical and dental appointments for annual checkups and vaccinations; and (2) the routine medical care needs of elderly relatives of the eligible employee, including visits to nursing homes and group homes.</summary>
