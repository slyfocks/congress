Directs the Secretary, by that time, to eliminate the ten existing regional offices of the Forest Service and replace them with State offices.Directs the Secretary to establish a State office of the Forest Service in each State containing any portion of the National Forest System. Authorizes establishment of a Forest Service office to serve more than one State, or consolidate separate offices previously established, if: (1) the total acreage of System lands in a particular State does not justify a separate Forest Service office for that State; and (2) the System lands in that State can be readily managed through a Forest Service office in another State.Authorizes the Secretary to establish up to six technical support centers, which must be at the same location as a State office."
