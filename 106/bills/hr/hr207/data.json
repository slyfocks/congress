Requires, if such condition is met, that any amounts received by the individual as such an allowance shall be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the enactment of this Act, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable as specified by this Act. Requires that 100 percent of all amounts received as such an allowance, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after enactment, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this paragraph) for purposes of computing: (1) an annuity of a disabled employee or member; and (2) a survivor annuity if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service."
