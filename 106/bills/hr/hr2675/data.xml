  <summary>8/2/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to revise within-State allocation requirements to allow a local board that represents a local area with an unemployment rate of ten percent or more to transfer up to 35 percent (currently, 20 percent) of specified funds between adult employment and training activities and dislocated worker employment and training activities. (Retains the 20 percent limitation on such transfers for local boards representing local areas with unemployment rates of less than ten percent.)</summary>
