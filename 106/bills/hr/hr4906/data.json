    "text": "Enterprise Integration Act of 2000 - Requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish an initiative for advancing enterprise integration within the United States. Requires such initiative to begin with product data management and build upon ongoing efforts of NIST and the private sector, to involve consortia that include government and industry, and to be designed to permit enterprise integration in each U.S. major manufacturing industry at the earliest possible date.Requires the Director to identify all enterprise integration standards and implementation activities for major manufacturing industries underway in the United States and abroad. Requires: (1) the Director to work with industry representatives and organizations currently engaged in enterprise integration activities; and (2) such representatives and organizations to assess the current state of enterprise integration within the industry, identify the remaining steps, and work toward agreement on the roles of NIST and the private sector. Requires the Director to report to Congress on these matters and on anticipated related NIST activities.Requires the Director to submit to Congress a plan for enterprise integration for each major manufacturing industry, including milestones for NIST's portion of the plan, the dates of likely achievement of those milestones, and anticipated costs to the Government and industry by fiscal year. Requires, for a given industry, updates of the plans and a progress report for the past year to be submitted annually until enterprise integration has been achieved.Authorizes appropriations."
