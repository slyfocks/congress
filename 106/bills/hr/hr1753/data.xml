Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 - Directs the Secretary of Energy, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy, to commence a methane hydrate research and development program. Authorizes the Secretary to award program grants or contracts (based on a competitive merit-based process) to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, institutions of higher education and industrial enterprises.Directs the Secretary to establish a panel to: (1) provide advice on applications of methane hydrate and priorities for the program; and (2) report to Congress on the impact on global climate change from methane hydrate formation and degassing and the consumption of natural gas produced from such hydrates. Limits to five percent the amount of program funding that can be used for administrative expense and prohibits the use of program funding for building construction.Requires the Secretary, in awarding such grants or contracts or entering into such cooperative agreements, to: (1) facilitate and develop partnerships among government, industry, and institutions of higher education; (2) undertake programs to develop basic information necessary for promoting long-term interest in methane hydrate resources as an energy source; (3) ensure that the data and information developed through the program are accessible and widely disseminated; (4) promote cooperation among agencies that are developing technologies that may hold promise for methane hydrate resource development; and (5) report annually to Congress on accomplishments.Amends the Mining and Minerals Policy Act of 1970 to: (1) redefine "marine mineral resource" to include methane hydrate (for the purposes of the marine mineral resources research program); and (2) define "methane hydrate."Authorizes appropriations for FY 2002 through 2005.Sunsets the methane hydrate research and development program after the end of FY 2005.Instructs the Secretary to: (1) enter into an agreement with the National Research Council for a study and report to Congress on the progress made under the methane hydrate research and development program, together with any recommendations for future methane hydrate research and development needs; and (2) provide to the House Committee on Science any report or study prepared at the direction of any congressional committee.</summary>
