Authorizes the Director to use amounts from the Fund for any purpose that benefits the general welfare of inmates (but no inmate shall be entitled to any portion of the Fund).Specifies that employees compensated by or through the Fund may be assigned additional duties other than those directly related to commissary activities.Makes the Administrative Procedure Act inapplicable to the making of any determination, decision, or order under this Act."
