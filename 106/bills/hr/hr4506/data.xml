Teaching Children to Save Lives Act - Directs the Secretary of Education to make grants to State departments of education to establish cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, using nationally recognized training courses, in public schools which include students in any of grades six through 12 (targeted schools).Limits such grants to not more than $6,000 per targeted school. Requires such grants to provide funding for two-year programs in targeted schools, with a majority of the funding to be provided in the first year to pay for start-up costs, including initial teacher training in CPR instruction and purchase of printed informational or instructional materials, manikins, and other equipment. and the remainder in the second year to pay for upkeep, continued or additional teacher training, and other subsidiary cost. Requires such grants to be used to encourage and foster new and existing community partnerships with and among public and private organizations (such as local school districts, nonprofit organizations, public health organizations like the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, emergency medical service providers, fire and police departments, and parent-teacher associations) to aid in providing CPR training in targeted schools.Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
