  <summary>1/6/1999--Introduced.
Children's Environmental Protection Act - Amends the Toxic Substances Control Act to state U.S. policy regarding protection of vulnerable subpopulations from exposure to environmental pollutants. Defines "vulnerable subpopulations" as children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, and other subpopulations identified by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as likely to experience elevated health risks from environmental pollutants. Directs the Administrator to: (1) consistently and explicitly evaluate environmental health risks to vulnerable subpopulations in all risk assessments and characterizations, environmental and public health standards, and general regulatory decisions; (2) ensure that all EPA standards protect such subpopulations with an adequate margin of safety; (3) develop and use a separate assessment with respect to such subpopulations; and (4) issue revised standards, after reevaluation, that meet the criteria of this Act. Requires the Administrator to: (1) identify pollutants commonly used or found in areas reasonably accessible to children; (2) create and review at least annually a list of substances with known, likely, or suspected health risks to children and a list of safer-for-children substances and products for use in such areas; (3) establish guidelines to reduce and eliminate exposure to pollutants in such areas, including advice on integrated pest management; (4) create a family right-to-know information kit; and (5) make all information described above publicly available. Directs the Administrator and the Secretaries of Agriculture and of Health and Human Services to: (1) coordinate and support the development and implementation of research initiatives to examine the health effects and toxicity of pesticides and other pollutants on vulnerable subpopulations; and (2) report to the Congress. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
