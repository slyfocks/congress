Provides a private right of action for violations of such prohibition.Requires each interactive computer service provider to make available to each of its customers its policy regarding unsolicited e-mail, including options for the customer to elect to receive or not receive such e-mail. Prohibits customers from using the equipment or facilities of the provider to initiate the bulk transmission of an unsolicited e-mail message if the provider's policy prohibits such bulk transmissions. Provides a right of action for providers adversely affected by customer violations of such prohibition.States that a provider who in good faith takes action to restrict or prevent the receipt of unsolicited e-mail by its customers shall not be liable for any harm resulting from the failure to prevent such receipt."
