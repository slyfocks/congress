  <summary>7/1/1999--Introduced.
Worker Paycheck Fairness Act of 1999 - Requires a labor union accepting payment of any dues or fees from an employee as a condition of employment to secure from each employee a prior, voluntary, written authorization for any portion of such dues or fees which will be used for activities not necessary to performing the duties of exclusive representation in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues. Gives employees a right of civil action against any labor union which violates this requirement. Requires employers to post notice relating to such requirement. Amends the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 to require every labor union to attribute and report expenses by function classification in detail necessary to allow its members to determine whether such expenses were necessary to performing the duties of exclusive representation in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues. Requires disclosure under such Act to employees required to pay any union dues or fees (under a union security agreement) as well as to union members. Makes it unlawful for any labor organization to coerce, intimidate, threaten, interfere with, or retaliate against any employee in the exercise of, or on account of having exercised, any right granted or protected by this Act.</summary>
