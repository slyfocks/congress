    "text": "Education Savings and School Excellence Act of 2000 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code with respect to education individual retirement accounts (education IRAs) to increase maximum annual contribution limits to $2,000 per beneficiary.Permits tax-free expenditures for qualified elementary and secondary education expenses at a public, private, or religious school. Includes within such expenses tuition, books, tutoring, special needs services, computer equipment, room and board, uniforms, transportation, and home schooling meeting applicable State or local requirements.Waives the age limitation (18 years old) for contributions on behalf of a special needs beneficiary. Waives the age limitation (30 years old) for deemed distributions and rollover and beneficiary change provisions with respect to a special needs beneficiary.Limits contribution reductions based on adjusted gross income to individual contributors. (Permits entity contributions regardless of income.)Permits annual contributions to be made up to such year's tax filing date (not including extensions). Exempts excess contributions from the additional ten percent tax provided such contribution and interest earned are returned within six months after the end of the tax year for which the contribution was made.Coordinates education IRA distributions with: (1) the HOPE and Lifetime Earning Credit so that IRA distributions will not be part of gross income as long as they are not used for the same expenses as such credits; and (2) qualified tuition programs to allocate excess distributions between such programs, and eliminate the excess tax on excess contributions made to such programs on behalf of the same beneficiary.Renames the education individual retirement account as the education savings account.(Sec. 3) Collegiate Learning and Student Savings (CLASS) Act - Permits private higher educational institutions, in addition to currently permitted State institutions, to establish qualified tuition programs.
