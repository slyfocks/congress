Redefines the term \"signatory operator\" in a similar manner (as a 1988 operator).Provides for a reduction in health benefit premiums to coal miners if there is a surplus in the Combined Benefit Fund.Provides for a refund of premiums paid to the Fund for certain small entities which are not 1988 agreement operators.Provides for the transfer of certain amounts of interest from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to the Combined Fund.Reduces Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund fees. Extends the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fee program for an additional six years.Authorizes appropriations for the transfer of $38 million from the 1950 United Mine Workers of America Pension Plan annually to the Combined Fund to cover any shortfall in the premium account of the Combined Fund."
