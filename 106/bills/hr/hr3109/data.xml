  <summary>10/19/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize the President to make grants for assisting small businesses and agricultural enterprises adversely affected by a major disaster in meeting disaster-related expenses, including the costs of nonstructural repairs and replacement of noninsured contents and inventory.Disallows a small business or agricultural enterprise from using the proceeds of the grant for relocation, although such proceeds may be used for appropriate purposes in a new location, at the President's discretion, for safety, health, or mitigation purposes.Makes a small business or agricultural enterprise receiving assistance liable to the United States to the extent that such assistance duplicated benefits provided to such business or enterprise for the same purpose from another Federal agency. Requires any Federal agency that provides any duplicative assistance to collect an amount equal to the value of such duplicative assistance from the recipient when the head of such agency considers it to be in the Federal Government's best interest.Makes any small business or agricultural enterprise ineligible for assistance in relation to more than one major disaster and limits the maximum aggregate of such assistance to such small business or agricultural enterprise to $20,000 with respect to such disaster.Permits the President to only make a grant during the 90-day period beginning on the date of declaration of a major disaster.Makes the amendments made by this Act applicable to any major disaster declared after September 1, 1999, and before the date of the enactment of this Act. Provides that, for purposes of the maximum limit on assistance, the 90-day time period for such disaster shall begin on such date of enactment.</summary>
