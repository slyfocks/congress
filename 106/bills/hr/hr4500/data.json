    "text": "National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2000 - Authorizes appropriations to the National Science Foundation (NSF) for FY 2001 and 2002. Prohibits any such funds from being used to employ more than 75 full-time equivalent positions in the Office of the Director for either FY 2001 or 2002.(Sec. 3) Authorizes NSF to make grants for the establishment of regional plant genome and gene expression research and development centers to: (1) develop capabilities in basic plant genome research; (2) extend basic plant genomics research through plant breeding programs and accelerate its application to crop improvement, particularly the development and testing of new varieties of enhanced food crops; and (3) serve as centers for scientific and safety information on plant genomics. Prohibits NSF from providing funds for more than half of the cost of establishing any such research and development center.(Sec. 4) Directs NSF to make grant awards to support research on learning focusing on brain research as a foundation for research on human learning, behavioral, cognitive, affective, and social aspects of such learning, science, mathematics, engineering, and technological learning in formal and informal educational settings, and learning in complex educational systems. Declares that the goals of which such research shall be to integrate scientific disciplines into research on learning, to gain a better understanding of how research and educational practice can be reconciled, and to test, evaluate, and refine hypotheses across disciplines.Requires NSF to make grants for the establishment of centers of research on learning to bring together multidisciplinary teams of researchers to support such research goals.Authorizes NSF to participate in the Interagency Education Research Initiative.Directs NSF to sponsor a conference on human learning and education research to bring together researchers from many disciplines, including the physical sciences, neurological sciences, social sciences, and education practitioners to review past research on learning, assess current research efforts, and develop recommendations to address outstanding research issues and to disseminate research results to such practitioners.(Sec. 5) Makes technical amendments to the National Science Foundation Act of 1950.(Sec. 6) Prohibits the application of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 with respect to specified reports relevant to the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Science, including certain reports originating from the National Science Foundation."
