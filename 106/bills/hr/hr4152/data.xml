Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act of 2000 - Amends title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) to permit payments to be made under SSA titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) with respect to organ procurement costs attributable to organ procurement agencies only if an agency is certified or recertified as meeting standards to be a qualified organ procurement organization within the previous four (currently, two) years.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set forth in regulations the process and performance standards by which an organization shall be so certified or recertified consistent with the following: (1) certification or recertification shall be made no more frequently than once every four years; (2) performance standards shall use outcome and process measures that are based on empirical evidence of organ donor potential and other related factors in each service area of qualified organ procurement organizations and multiple outcome measures, which may or may not be based on empirical evidence.Authorizes a certified qualified organ procurement organization that does not meet such performance standards to submit a corrective action plan to the Secretary. Provides an additional three-year period for an organization to implement an approved plan and treats such organization as certified during such period.Requires the Secretary to implement procedures for appeals of decisions to deny certification or recertification.</summary>
