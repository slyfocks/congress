Subjects the mineral assessment program to review and approval by the Arizona State Department of Mines and Mineral Resources.Bars the Secretary from making, modifying, or extending any mineral withdrawal authorized by law within the conservation area after January 1, 1999, until the assessment, consultation with, and review by, the State are completed. Permits the removal of minerals from the conservation area after completion of such requirements.(Sec. 107) Requires the Secretary, subject to the availability of funds, to carry out ecological resources restoration projects within the conservation area. Prohibits such projects from adversely affecting grazing allotments for more than three years unless an extension has been agreed upon by the permittee.
