Requires the Comptroller General to transmit an independent audit containing the prescribed assessments and analyses on a final rule, together with a summary of the differences between the proposed and final rule, within 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.Authorizes appropriations.Provides for the pilot project established under this Act to continue for a five-year period if specified appropriations are provided.
