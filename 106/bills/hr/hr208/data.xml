  <summary>7/21/2000--Passed Senate amended.
Amends Federal civil service law with respect to the Thrift Savings Plan to provide that a Federal employee or Member of Congress: (1) may contribute to the Thrift Savings Fund (TSF) an eligible rollover distribution that a qualified trust could accept under the Internal Revenue Code; and (2) shall be afforded an opportunity to elect to contribute to the TSF beginning on the date of commencing service or the earliest date administratively feasible (thus eliminating current waiting periods).Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations under which a lump-sum credit for an employee's or Member's retirement contributions shall not be paid without the consent of the employee's or Member's spouse and former spouse where OPM has received information or documentation that a court order bars payment of the credit in order to preserve the court's ability to award a survivor or former spouse's annuity, or that payment of the credit would extinguish the spouse's or former spouse's entitlement, under a court order on file, to such an annuity.</summary>
