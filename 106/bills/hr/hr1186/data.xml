  <summary>3/18/1999--Introduced.
Amends the Water Resources Development Act of: (1) 1990 to direct the Secretary of the Army to include primary flood damages avoided within a benefit analysis for justifying Federal non-structural flood damage reduction projects; and (2) 1986 to require the Secretary to pay additional costs for such projects when non-Federal contributions exceed 35 percent. Directs the Secretary, at the request of a non-Federal interest for a flood control project, to reevaluate a previously authorized project to consider nonstructural alternatives in light of amendments made under this Act.</summary>
