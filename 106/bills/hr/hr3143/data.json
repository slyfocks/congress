    "text": "High Performance Schools Act of 1999 - Establishes the High Performance Schools Program, in the Department of Education, to assist school districts in the production of high performance elementary and secondary school buildings that are healthful, productive, energy efficient, and environmentally sound.(Sec. 3) Authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants, through the Program, for: (1) assisting school districts to implement this Act's purpose; (2) administering the program of assistance to school districts under this Act; and (3) promoting participation by school districts in the Program.Requires grants to assist school districts to be used to achieve energy efficiency performance not less than 30 percent beyond the levels prescribed in the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code as it is in effect for new construction and existing buildings. Requires such grants to be made to school districts that: (1) need to respond appropriately to increasing elementary and secondary school enrollments or to make major investments in renovation of school facilities; (2) do not have adequate funds to do so without such assistance; and (3) are committed to using grant funds to develop high performance school buildings in accordance with an approved plan.Requires grants for administration to be used to evaluate compliance by school districts with requirements of this Act. Allows such grants also to be used to: (1) distribute information and materials to define and promote development of high performance school buildings for new and existing facilities; (2) organize and conduct programs for school board members, school district personnel, architects, engineers, and others to advance the concepts of such buildings; (3) obtain technical services and assistance in planning and designing such buildings; and (4) collect and monitor data and information pertaining to such building projects.Allows grants to promote participation to be used for promotional and marketing activities, including facilitating private and public financing, promoting the use of energy service companies, working with school administrations, students, and communities, and coordinating public benefit programs.Allows grants under this Act to be provided only to school districts that have developed plans that the State agency designated by the Governor of the State determines to be feasible and appropriate. Requires such State agency to encourage qualifying school districts to supplement their grant funds with funds from other sources in the implementation of their plans.(Sec. 4) Requires funds appropriated for the implementation of this Act, with the exception of certain reserved funds, to be provided to the Governors of the States. Directs each Governor to determine the appropriate State agency to administer the program of assistance to school districts. Allocates such funds as follows: (1) 70 percent for grants to assist school districts; (2) 15 percent for grants for administration; and (3) 15 percent for grants to promote participation.Authorizes the Secretary of Education to retain, through the Program, a limited annual amount to assist State agencies designated by the Governor in coordinating and implementing such Program. Allows funds to be used to develop reference materials to further define the principles and criteria to achieve high performance school buildings.(Sec. 5) Authorizes appropriations."
