(Sec. 105) Modifies provisions of the Act regarding: (1) concentration of Federal effort to repeal the requirements that the Administrator of the Office develop for each fiscal year a comprehensive plan of activities and that each Federal agency administering a Federal juvenile delinquency program submit annually a juvenile delinquency development statement; and (2) an annual report to require that such report include an evaluation of programs funded and their effectiveness in reducing the incidence of juvenile delinquency, particularly violent crime committed by juveniles.

(Sec. 109) Modifies Act requirements regarding State plans. Provides that the advisory group shall consist of the State attorney general or such other State official who has primary responsibility for overseeing the enforcement of State criminal laws. Requires State plans to: (1) contain plans for providing needed services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency in rural areas, mental health services to juveniles in the juvenile justice system, and gender-specific services for the prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency; and (2) provide for the coordination and maximum utilization of existing juvenile delinquency programs, programs operated by private agencies, and other related programs in the State. Requires such plans to provide that not less than 75 percent of the funds available to the State be used for specified purposes, including: (1) programs that assist in holding juveniles accountable for their actions; (2) expanded use of probation officers; (3) boot camps for juvenile offenders; (4) other activities (such as court-appointed special advocates) that the State determines will hold juveniles accountable for their acts and decrease juvenile involvement in delinquent activities; (5) establishing policies and systems to incorporate relevant child protective services records into juvenile justice records for purposes of establishing treatment plans for juvenile offenders; (6) a system of records equivalent to the records that would be kept for adults relating to any adjudication of juveniles under 18 years of age as delinquent for conduct that would constitute a violent crime if committed by an adult; (7) programs that utilize multidisciplinary interagency case management and information sharing that enable the juvenile justice and law enforcement agencies, schools, and social service agencies to make more informed decisions regarding early identification, control, supervision, and treatment of juveniles who repeatedly commit violent or serious delinquent acts; and (8) programs designed to prevent and reduce hate crimes committed by juveniles. Revises State plan requirements regarding limits on the placement of juveniles in secure detention or correctional facilities, juvenile contact with adults incarcerated or awaiting trial on criminal charges, and juvenile detention or confinement in adult jails and lockups. Permits the temporary detention of juveniles accused of nonstatus offenses in adult prisons where specified requirements are met, including that: (1) a parent or other legal guardian consents to such detention but has the right to revoke such consent at any time; (2) the juvenile has counsel and the counsel has an opportunity to present the juvenile's position regarding the detention or confinement involved to the court before the court approves; and (3) the detention of such juvenile is approved in advance by a court with competent jurisdiction as being in the best interest of the juvenile and is for a period preceding sentencing. Modifies State plan requirements to: (1) allow juveniles to be housed in adult facilities for up to 48 (currently, 24) hours before their initial court appearance; and (2) require States to implement systems to ensure that public child welfare records relating to a juvenile before a court in the juvenile justice system that are on file in the geographical area under the court's jurisdiction will be made known to such court.

(Sec. 204) Revises Act provisions regarding: (1) approval of applications to direct the Secretary to consider the geographical distribution in the State of the proposed services and which areas of the State have the greatest need for such services, and to give priority to eligible applicants who have demonstrated experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth and who request grants of less than $200,000; (2) authority for the transitional living grant program to repeal definitions of "homeless youth" and "transitional living youth project"; (3) eligibility for assistance by stating that the annual report submitted by grant applicants to the Secretary must include statistical summaries describing the number and characteristics of the services provided to the homeless youth; and (4) authority to make grants for research, demonstration, and service projects to repeal references to home-based and street based services from the research and demonstration projects.
