  <summary>3/25/1999--Introduced.
After-School Children's Education (ACE) Act - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to provide for grants, a national clearinghouse, and a report to improve the quality and availability of after-school programs. (Sec. 3) Increases the amount authorized to be appropriated for child care programs under the Act. Requires States to use at least one percent of each fiscal year's funds, in coordination with child care resource and referral centers to the extent practicable, for activities designed to improve the quality and availability of after-school programs, including: (1) informational assistance; (2) coordination of after-school programs; (3) development of innovative, age-appropriate, age-appealing, and enriching after-school programs; or (4) development of creative funding strategies to make after-school programs affordable for all parents. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Commissioner on Children, Youth, and Families, to establish a clearinghouse for after-school program technical assistance and models. Requires the clearinghouse to be available to the public, including via Internet. (Sec. 5) Directs the General Accounting Office to report to the Congress on after-school programs in each State: (1) describing types of programs, unmet needs, and barriers to participation, quality, and improvement; and (2) analyzing in detail such programs in 15 communities selected to represent a variety of regional, population, and demographic profiles. Includes among after-school programs in such report those sponsored by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the Boy Scouts of America, the Girl Scouts of America, YMCAs, and athletic and other programs operated by public schools and other State and local agencies.</summary>
