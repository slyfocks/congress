(Sec. 102) Requires the Medicare and Medicaid programs (titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act), programs through the Public Health Service Act, programs through the Indian Health Service, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), and other programs administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, where relevant, to inform individuals that they should expect to have their pain managed under such programs. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary to provide funds for implementation of special education projects carried out by peer review organizations to improve the quality of pain and symptom management. (Sec. 105) Amends Medicare provisions relating to the Medicare+Choice program to provide for dissemination to Medicare beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of information about an organization's coverage, and an evaluation of plan performance and quality, regarding pain and symptom management. Directs the Secretary to determine how to include measurements of pain and symptom management in Medicare, Medicaid, and other appropriate Federal programs. (Sec. 106) Mandates a report by the Surgeon General to appropriate congressional committees and the public on the state of pain and symptom management in the United States. Title II: Developing Community Resources - Mandates grants to health care provider training entities for the establishment of six National Family Support Networks in Pain and Symptom Management. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Reimbursement Barriers - Requires the existing Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPac) to study and report to appropriate congressional committees on: (1) the way Medicare policies may limit pain and symptom management and palliative care services; (2) Medicare and Medicaid financial barriers to continuity of care and interdisciplinary or supportive care for chronic pain patients and those who are terminally ill; (3) reimbursement barriers in providing pain and symptom management through hospice care; (4) whether the Medicare reimbursement system provides providers incentives to delay informing terminally ill patients of hospice and palliative care availability; and (5) the impact of providing payments for drug therapy management services in pain and symptom management and palliative care. (Sec. 302) Requires the General Accounting Office to survey public and private health insurance providers and report to appropriate congressional committees on whether the insurers' reimbursement policies inhibit patient access to pain and symptom management. Title IV: Improving Federal Coordination of Policy, Research, and Information - Establishes the Advisory Committee on Pain and Symptom Management. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary, through a contract with the Institute of Medicine, to review research findings and report to appropriate congressional committees on: (1) the effects of controlled substance regulation on patient access to effective care; (2) factors that may contribute to the underuse of pain medications, including opioids; and (3) State legal and regulatory barriers that may impact patient access to medications for pain and symptom management. (Sec. 403) Mandates the convening of a national conference to discuss the translation of pain research into the delivery of health services, using unobligated amounts appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services. Title V: Demonstration Projects - Mandates grants to establish at least five demonstration projects on effective methods to measure improvement in the skills and knowledge of health care personnel in pain and symptom management. Authorizes appropriations."
