    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to repeal a provision which prohibits a State or local government from regulating the placement, construction, and modification of personal wireless service facilities on the basis of environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations concerning such emissions. Requires, in an action in which a person is seeking to place, construct, or modify a telecommunications facility, that such person bear the burden of proof as to the necessity of such placement, construction, or modification. Prohibits the FCC from adopting as a final rule a specified proposed rule which preempts State and local authority over the placement of broadcast transmission facilities. States that no provision of the Act may be interpreted to: (1) authorize any person or entity to place, construct, or modify telecommunications facilities in a manner inconsistent with State or local law if alternative technology is capable of delivering the broadcast or telecommunications signals without the use of a tower; or (2) prohibit a State or local government from requiring the production of safety and interference studies with respect to such facilities."
