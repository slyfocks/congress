United States Support for a Democratic Pakistan Act of 1999 - Prohibits the President from waiving certain economic and military sanctions imposed on Pakistan until he certifies to Congress that Pakistan has a democratically elected government which shows respect for the basic civil liberties and human rights of the Pakistani people. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to direct the U.S. Executive Directors at specified international financial institutions to use the U.S. vote at each institution to oppose the provision of assistance for any project in Pakistan, until the President makes such certification. Authorizes the President to waive the requirements in this Act if it is in the national security interests of the United States.</summary>
