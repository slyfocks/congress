  <description>Amendment originally sought to prohibit any U.S. contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) unless the President certifies that the UNFPA has terminated all activities in China and that there have been no coerced abortions associated with the Chinese population control program. \   As amended by the Campbell substitute amendment (A004), the above was replaced with language that authorizes $25 million for the UNFPA; prohibits the use of any U.S. funds from being used in China; and places certain conditions on the availability of funds to the UNFPA.</description>
