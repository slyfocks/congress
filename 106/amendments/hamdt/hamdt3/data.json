  "purpose": "An amendment to modify the effect of the new point of order established by the bill. Under the amendment, the House would not be required to vote on continuing consideration of the pending legislation, but, as under H.R. 350, the House would have an additional 20 minutes to debate the private sector mandates of the legislation. Further, a point of order could be raised against measures that CBO (and only CBO) estimates would result in costs to the private sector of more than $100 million a year, or against measures that lack the required CBO information on private sector mandates. If the presiding officer rules that CBO has so estimated, or that the measure lacks the CBO information, the House would then have the additional 20 minutes to debate the measure's private sector costs, and would then complete the remaining debate on the legislation.",
