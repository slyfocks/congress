These fatherhood projects are required to provide information about sexually transmitted diseases, including human papillomavirus (HPV). Finally, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required, in selecting fatherhood projects for funding, to grant preference to projects that set forth clear and practical methods to encourage and sustain marriage. The amendment is considered as adopted pursuant to the provisions of H. Res. 566.",
