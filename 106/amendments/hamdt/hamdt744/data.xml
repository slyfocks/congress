  <description>Amendment originally sought to designate certain lands in the San Rafael Swell area as wilderness study areas. \   As amended by the Boehlert substitute amendment (A004), the above was replaced with language that makes clear that lands within the conservation area are to be managed in at least as protective a manner as they are now, pending completion of the management plan; and states Congress's intent that the management plan overall only strengthen existing land protections.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to provide interim protection to lands that are not yet designated as Wilderness Study Areas.</purpose>
