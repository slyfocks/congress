      <text>Mr. Walsh raised a point of order against the Filner amendment (A001). Mr. Walsh stated that the amendment sought to appropriate funds not previously authorized. In addition, the proposed designation as "emergency funds" constituted legislation in an appropriations bill. The Chair sustained the point of order.</text>
