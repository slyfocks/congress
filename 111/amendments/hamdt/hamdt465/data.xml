  <description>Amendment sought to require a GAO report on (1) the background checks and forms of identification required under state and local transportation security programs; (2) a determination of whether those requirements conflict with Federal programs; (3) a determination of whether those requirements assist in carrying out state and local government safety, security and law enforcement responsibilities; and (4) recommendations on ways to minimize redundant background checks and facilitate the sharing of data with state and local governments. Amendment also sought to prohibit the secretary of the Department which oversees the Coast Guard from preventing a state or local government from requiring a separate background check for entry into any area covered by a vessel or facility security plan.</description>
