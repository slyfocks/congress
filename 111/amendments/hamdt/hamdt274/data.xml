  <description>Amendment clarifies that section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-140) does not preclude Federal agencies from purchasing fuel that is not predominantly derived from tar-sands or other high-carbon sources.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment numbered 20 printed in House Report 111-182 to provide that section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-140) does not prohibit an agency from entering into a contract to purchase a generally-available fuel that is not a synthetic fuel or predominantly produced from a non-conventional petroleum source if the contract does not specifically require such a fuel. The purpose of the contract is not to obtain such a fuel, and the contract does not provide incentives for upgrading or expanding refineries to increase fuel from non-controversial petroleum sources.</purpose>
