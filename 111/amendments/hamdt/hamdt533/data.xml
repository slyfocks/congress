  <description>Amendment sought to stem the unintended consequences resulting from the definitional change of NRSRO from Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization to Nationally Registered Statistical Rating Organization. Section 6005 creates inconsistencies in the securities laws as it amends the definition only in the 1933 and 1934 Acts and it has potential impact on state rules and regulations requiring a change of state level statute.</description>
