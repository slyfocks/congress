The increase is offset by a decrease of the same amount in funding for the Agriculture Buildings and Facilities, General Services Administration account. Would increase the appropriation for the Higher Education Multicultural Scholars Program by $519,000 to a total of $1.5 million. The amount would be offse. by decreasing appropriations for `administrative expenses necessary to carry out direct and guaranteed loan programs' within the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund Program Account.

Would fund the Methamphetamine Inhibitor Grant Program created in the 2008 Farm Bill at $2,000,000. Offsets the increase in spending by reducing spending on Rural Development Salaries and Expenses.
