  <description>Amendment alters the standard for when TSA can issue an emergency regulation or security device without adhering to the rulemaking and public notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The amendment also allows TSA to issue a regulation or security directive when needed "to respond to an imminent threat of finite duration" and would require TSA to comply with the rule making requirements of the APA when a security directive or emergency order has been in place for more than 180 days.</description>
