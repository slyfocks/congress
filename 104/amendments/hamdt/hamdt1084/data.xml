      <text>Mr. Portman raised a point of order against the Riggs amendment (A002). Mr. Portman stated that the effect of the amendment offered by Mr. Riggs would violate the Budget Act by imposing an unfunded mandate. The Speaker ruled that the test of establishing a threshold burden had been met and the House proceeded with 20 minutes of debate on the point of order. After debate, the question will be put on whether to consider the Riggs amendment.</text>
