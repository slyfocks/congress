  <description>Amendment sought to make open to the public all records in product liability cases, except under special circumstances.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to prohibit sealing court records of product liability law suits, except under limited circumstances. The amendment would allow court records to be sealed only by a court order and only if the information to be sealed would not restrict information relevant to public health or safety; or if the need to maintain confidentiality would substantially outweigh the public interest in disclosing potential health or safety hazards.</purpose>
