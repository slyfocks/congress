  <description>Amendment, as modified, transfers $3 million from the acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad account of the Department of State to the scientific and technical research and services account of the Department of Commerce.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment, as modified, to reduce the rescission of funds in the bill for scientific and technical research services by $3 million dollars and to offset the reduction by increasing the rescission of funds for the State Department for acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad. The effect of the amendment would be to rescind $16.5 million in funds for scientific and technical research services, rather than the $19.5 million called for in the bill, and to rescind State Department funds for building maintenance by $23 million, rather than the $20 million called for in the bill.</purpose>
