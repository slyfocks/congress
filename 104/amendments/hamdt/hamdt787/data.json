  "description": "Amendment sought to strike provisions in the bill outlining revised definitions and procedures regarding \"full and open\" competition; add provisions instructing agencies seeking procurement bids to hold a conference for any interested firm to inform them of needs and qualifications necessary to compete for jobs; and allow agencies to make preliminary assessments on initial bids received to determine if proposals have a chance at receiving a contract.",

  "purpose": "An amendment, printed as amendment No. 1 in the Congressional Record of September 12, 1995 to delete the provisions of the bill that revise definitions and procedures for establishing full and open competition, and the provisions establishing a unified verification system that considers the past performance of firms as a factor in evaluating future bids. The amendment would add a set of provisions to instruct agencies seeking procurement bids to inform all interested firms of the necessary qualifications for competing for the gob. The amendment would allow agencies to make preliminary assesments, rather than complete evaluations, on initial bids to determine if proposals qualify for receiving the contract.",
