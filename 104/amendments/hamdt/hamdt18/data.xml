  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to allow a majority of Congress to waive the balanced budget provisions contained in the joint resolution in any fiscal year that the national unemployment rate exceeds 4 percent; and would not have required a three-fifths vote to increase taxes.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute similar to the provisions of H. J. Res. 1, but without the requirement of a three-fifths vote to raise taxes. The substitute would instead require a three-fifths vote to raise the debt ceiling and increase deficit spending. These restrictions could be waived during times of war, military conflict, or upon the adoption of a joint resolution, upon notification by the President that the national rate of unemployment is projected to exceed 4%. (Text of the amendment was printed in the Congressional Record on January 17, 1994 as amendment No. 4.).</purpose>
