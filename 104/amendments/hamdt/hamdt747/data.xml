  <description>Amendment originally sought to recommend the establishment of a voluntary television rating system and require that television sets manufactured in or imported into the United States be equipped with program-blocking (V-Chip) technology. \   As amended by the Coburn substitute amendment (A008), the above was replaced with language that encourages the television and video industry to establish industry-wide technology standards and rating procedures which would empower parents to block programming they deem inappropriate for their children; and requires the GAO to submit to Congress a report evaluating the availability and effectiveness of such technologies, standards, and procedures.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment printed in House Report 104-223 as amendment No. 2-6, to recommend the establishment of a voluntary television rating system and to require that television sets manufactured in or imported into the United States be equipped with program-blocking (V-Chip) technology.</purpose>
