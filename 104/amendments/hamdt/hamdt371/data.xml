  <description>Amendment sought to strike provisions which delay compliance deadlines for State non-point source pollution control programs by one year for every year in which the bill is less than fully funded.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment (printed as amendment No. 40 in the Congressional Record of May 9) to delete certain provisions in the bill relating to nonpoint source pollution that exempts agricultural producers from compliance with a state pollution management program, if the producers have established an approved resources management plan. The amendment would also delete provisions in the bill that allow states to take the availability of federal funds into consideration when demonstrating progress toward achieving water quality standards, and permits states to postpone compliance for every year Congress fails to adequately fund authorized assistance programs.</purpose>
