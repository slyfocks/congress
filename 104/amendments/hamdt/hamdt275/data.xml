  <description>Amendment sought to replace the "loser pays" requirements with provisions that would require the attorney for the losing party to pay the legal costs and other expenses of the prevailing party if the court determines that the losing party's case was brought for an improper purpose, is unwarranted, lacks evidentiary support, or unless the court determines the losing party was principally responsible</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to replace the current "loser pays" provisions of the bill with new language which would specifically target attorneys who initiate frivolous law suits. The amendment would require courts to award costs and legal fees to the prevailing party in a securities lawsuit if the plaintiff's complaint or motion was intended to harass, caused unneccessary delay, or increased the cost of litigation. The amendment would require the courts to hold the losing party's attorney liable for any costs and fees awarded unless the losing party was responsible for the frivolous suit.</purpose>
