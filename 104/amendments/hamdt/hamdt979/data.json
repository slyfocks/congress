  "description": "Amendment sought to change the current H-2A temporary agriculture worker program by replacing the labor certification requirement with a labor attestation requirement; establish a three year pilot program which would have required employers to file a form with the State employment security agency in the area of intended employment; require employers to offer temporary agriculture workers housing or to offer a reasonable housing allowance; require employers to withhold 25 percent of the temporary worker's salary in a trust fund and accessible only when the worker returned home; and require that guest workers be issued an identification card including a picture and fingerprints that the employee must present to access the funds in the trust account.",

  "purpose": "An amendment to change the current temporary agriculture worker program by replacing the labor certification requirement with a labor attestation requirement. The end result is a three year alternative pilot program which would require employers to file a form with the state employment security agency in the area of intended employment. The amendment requires employers to offer temporary agriculture workers housing or to offer a \"reasonable\" housing allowance; directs the employer to hold 25% of the temporary worker's salary in a trust fund to be administered by the Justice Department and accessible only when guest workers return to their native countries; and requires that guest workers be issued an identification card including a picture and fingerprints that the employee must present to access the fund in the trust account.",
