  <description>An amendment to permit the defendant in any state or federal civil liability action to introduce evidence concerning the claimants' receipt of benefits from a collateral source as reimbursement for the harm suffered; the claimant, in turn, may introduce evidence concerning any payments or contributions made to secure the rights to such benefits. No provider of collateral source benefits may claim or recover any amount from damages awarded by either the court or an arbiter, nor from any settlement between the disputing parties. These provisions preempt state laws to the extent any conflict exists, but permits states to impose greater restrictions on liability or damages if they choose.</description>
