  <description>An amendment (numbered 95 as printed in the Congressional Record) to provide that the bill's definition of a "federal intergovernmental mandate" does not include any provision that preempts state, local, or tribal governments from engaging in economic regulation, even if this would limit revenues to these governments. The amendment is intended to ensure that legislation deregulating various industries would not be subject to points of order under the bill.</description>
