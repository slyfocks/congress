  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to exempt Social Security from balanced budget calculations; and provide that before the constitutional amendment could take effect, Congress would be required to pass legislation showing what the budget will be for the fiscal years 1996 through 2002, containing aggregate levels of new budget authority, outlays, reserves, and the deficit and surplus, as well as new budget authority and outlays on an account-by-account basis.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute that would exempt Social Security from balanced budget calculations; not require supermajority votes to run deficits or raise the public debt limit; not require a supermajority to raise taxes; and require "truth-in-budgeting" provisions that stipulate on an account-by-account basis how the budget would be balanced over the period between FY 1996 and FY 2002 before the constitutional amendment could take effect.</purpose>
