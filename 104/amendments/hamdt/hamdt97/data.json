  "description": "Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to add the text of H.R. 4600, amending the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to provide for the expedited consideration of certain proposed rescissions of budget authority which passed the House in 1994. The addition of this language would have enabled the President to choose between the use of a line-item veto procedure or expedited rescission procedures when proposing rescissions of appropriations or vetoes of targeted tax benefits.",

  "purpose": "An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the original text of H.R. 2, but adding provisions to allow the President to choose between using a line item veto or specified expedited rescissions procedures, which would require a vote of Congress to overturn. The amendment specifies that, should the courts declare the line item veto provisions of the bill, the expedited rescission provisions would remain in effect. (Text of the amendment was printed as amendment No. 35 in the Congressional Record of February 3, 1995.).",
