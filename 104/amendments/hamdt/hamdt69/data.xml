  <description>Amendment sought to change the bill's definition of "Federal intergovernmental mandate" so that it would not include any provision which would apply an enforceable mandate equally to the public sector and to the private sector. A point of order would, therefore, not stand against provisions that apply equally to the public and private sectors.</description>
