  <description>Amendment offered as a substitute to the Lipinski amendment (A023) sought to change the bill's formula for allocating sewage treatment plant construction funds. It would have retained the bill's method of allocating funds based on State population and sewage treatment needs, but would have placed caps on how much any State's allocation could increase or decrease from present funding levels, phased in over five years.</description>
