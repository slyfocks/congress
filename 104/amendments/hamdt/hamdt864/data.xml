  <description>Amendments en bloc make technical corrections and provide that regional councils may impose fees on fishing vessels in order to cover the costs of placing observers aboard such fishing vessels; require that if observers are needed in fisheries governed under an individual transferrable quota (ITQ) system fishery, they be present at a level that insures statistically significant enforcement of catch quotas; and require that fish processing vessels in ITQ fisheries carry enough observers to ensure the vessels are monitored 24 hours per day.</description>
