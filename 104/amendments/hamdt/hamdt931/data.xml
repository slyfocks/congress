  <description>Amendment sought to delete provisions that authorize fixed annual cash payments to farmers that decline for each of the next seven years; phase out the current Federal commodity support programs for major crops over five years, while keeping the current price support system during the five-year transition period; and set a support price for each commodity in 1996, to be decreased by 4 percent each year and eliminated entirely for the 2001 year crop.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to phase out over five years the existing price supports for wheat, feed, grains, rice, cotton and oilseeds. The bill would replace the current system of price supports with a schedule of fixed payments that would gradually be reduced over seven years.</purpose>
