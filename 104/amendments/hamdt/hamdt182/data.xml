  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to extend the 25 percent deduction of the costs of health insurance for the self-employed; provide a tax deduction for health insurance premiums for employees whose employers do not subsidize their health insurance; narrow the tax preference for sales of radio, television, and cable companies to minority-owned firms; and enact provisions to tax certain assets owned by individuals who renounce their U.S. citizenship.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment in the nature of a substitute which, like the bill, would extend the current 25% health insurance deduction for self-employed persons, but would also provide a phased-in tax deuction for health insurance premiums for employees who receive no health insurance from their employers. The amendment would narrow but not eliminate, as the bill does, the tax preference for the sale of radio, tv, and cable companies to minority-owned firms.</purpose>
