  "purpose": "An amendment in the nature of a substitute (printed in the Congressional Record of May 16) to achieve a balanced budget by FY 2000 without implementing any tax cuts. The substitute would cut domestic spending by $207.6 billion less than the resolution, cutting Medicare by $114 billion less than the resolution; Medicaid by $50 billion less; and $12.9 billion less in cuts to farm programs. Domestic discretionary spending would be cut by $60 billion less than the resolution and the substitute would spend $35 billion more in education and training, $11 billion more in health programs, and $6 billion more for community and regional development. The substitute would spend approximately $60 billion less over seven years than recommended in the resolution.",
