      <text>Mr. Hoyer raised a point of order against the Salmon amendment (A014). Mr. Hoyer stated that the amendment offered by Mr. Salmon did not specifically address the issues described in the unanimous consent agreement of July 16, 1996 and was, therefore, outside the scope of the agreement and not in order.
