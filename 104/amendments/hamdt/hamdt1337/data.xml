  <purpose>An amendment to require states to provide health care benefits to public safety officers who are forced to resign or retire because of an injury they received in the course of duty, at least equal to benefits received by officers who resign or retire voluntarily. States that fail to provide such coverage will be eligible for only up to 90% of the state and local law enforcement funding for which they qualify.</purpose>
