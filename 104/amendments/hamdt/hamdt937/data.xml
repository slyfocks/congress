  <description>Amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a strategy to achieve specific targets for future export sales and world market share; reauthorizes U.S. food aid programs through 2002; authorizes Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) export guarantees through 2002, and empowers the CCC to guarantee more exports to emerging markets and countries in transition to free-market systems; authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to reprogram unused export subsidy funds among a variety of export and food aid programs; and requires stricter monitoring of foreign compliance with the agricultural provisions of the Uruguay Round.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to reauthorize various food aid programs, including Food for Peace and Food for Progress. The amendment would also reauthorize the Foreign Agricultural Service and, export credit guarantees, and public-private partnership program to increase the U.S. share of world agricultural markets.
