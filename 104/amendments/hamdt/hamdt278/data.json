  "description": "Amendment sought to strike the provision that eliminates joint liability for noneconomic loss in product liability suits; and to change the cap on punitive damages to $250,000 or three times the economic and noneconomic damages awarded, whichever is greater.",

  "introduced_at": "1995-03-09", 
  "number": 278, 
  "purpose": "An amendment to remove the bill's disparate treatment of the two types of compensatory damages: economic damages (such as lost wages and medical bills) and non-economic damages (such as pain and suffering, loss of fertility, etc.). Specifically, the amendment strikes the section of the bill that abolishes \"joint and several\" liability-- in which any of the defendants can be required to pay the entire amount--for non-economic damages; and modifies the bill's cap on punitive damages at three times the claimants award for all compensatory damages, damages for economic losses and damages for non-economic losses, or $250,000, whichever is greater.",
