  <description>Amendment requires an independent study to improve the ability of the Office of Management and Budget to accurately reflect the budgetary implications of Small Business Administration loan programs.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment to express that it is the sense of the Congress that the subsidy models prepared by the Office of Management and Budget relative to loan programs sponsored by the Small Business Administration tend to overestimate potential risks of loss and overemphasize historical losses that may be anomolous and do not reflect the sucess of the programs as a whole.</purpose>
