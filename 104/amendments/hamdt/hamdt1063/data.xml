  <description>Amendment in the nature of a substitute sought to provide for a balanced budget by FY 2002 by providing $523.4 billion in deficit reduction over six years. It would have provided $126.3 billion more for education, training, environmental and health programs over six years than contained in the original resolution, and would have provided $25.4 billion less in defense funds. It would have reduced entitlement spending by $265 billion and would have provided for smaller reductions in Medicare and Medicaid than contained in the original resolution.</description>
