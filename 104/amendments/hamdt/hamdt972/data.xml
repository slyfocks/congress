  <description>Amendment deletes language which placed restrictions on family-based immigration into the United States.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment, printed as amendment No. 14 in House Rept. 104-483, to delete the provisions in the bill that require a Congressional reviewevery five years, beginning in FY 2004, of the appropriate worldwide levels of immigration to be permitted under the bill and tie subsequent reauthorization legislation to those levels. The amendment would require a congressional review of appropriate worldwide levels of immigration, but would link that level to future reauthorization.</purpose>
