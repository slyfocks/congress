  <description>Amendment requires that when Federal agencies issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, and receive comments back from the private sector and from State and local governments, that they choose the least costly alternative method of implementing the intent of the mandate; and if they do not choose the least costly alternative, then they must explain why they did not.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment (numbered 2 as printed in the Congressional Record) to require federal agencies, in cases where their rulemaking record indicates that there are two or more methods that could be used to accomplish the objectives of a particular regulation containing federal mandates, to 1) choose the option which is least costly and burdensome to state, local and tribal governments or to the private sector; or 2) publish with the final regulation an explanation of why the agency chose the more costly or burdensome method of applying the federal mandate.</purpose>
