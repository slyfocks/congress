  <description>Amendment sought to reaffirm Congress' power to declare war and the President's authority as commander-in-chief; and to strike the requirement of the President to submit a memorandum on the constitutionality of placing United States troops under foreign command.</description>
  <purpose>An amendment (numbered 32 as printed in the Congressional Record) to strike the current interpretation clause of section 401 (restricting DOD funding to U.S. forces under foreign command), along with the requirement for the president to submit a memorandum to Congress on the constitutionality of placing American troops under foreign command. Instead, it inserts a provision simply reaffirming Congress' power to declare war and the president's authority as commander-in-chief.</purpose>
