      <text>WORDS TAKEN DOWN - During the course of debate, Mr. Hoyer demanded that certain words spoken by Mr. Mica be taken down. The words were taken down and reported to the House and were deemed to be unparliamentary. Mr. Delay moved to permit Mr. Mica to proceed in order. The Chair put the question on the motion and annouced that, by voice vote, the motion was not agreed to. Mr. Linder objected to the vote on grounds that a quorum was not present and made a point of order that a quorum was not present. Accordingly, the Yeas and Nays were ordered.</text>
