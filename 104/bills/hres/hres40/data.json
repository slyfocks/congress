Prohibits any Member, officer, or employee of the House from knowingly accepting a gift from a paid lobbyist, lobbying firm, or an agent of a foreign principal. Includes within the gift restriction: (1) anything provided to a Member, officer, or employee by lobbyists or foreign agents which is believed to be paid for or reimbursed by a client or firm of the lobbyist or foreign agent; (2) charitable contributions made by lobbyists, lobbying firms, or foreign agents on the basis of a recommendation or specification of a Member, officer, or employee or charitable contributions made by such individuals in lieu of honoraria; (3) contributions and other payments by lobbyists, lobbying firms, or foreign agents to a legal expense fund established for the benefit of a Member, officer, or employee; and (4) financial contributions or expenditures made by lobbyists, lobbying firms, or foreign agents relating to a conference or similar event affiliated with an official congressional organization for or on behalf of Members, officers, or employees. Lists items exempt from such restriction, including: (1) unused items that are promptly returned to the donor; (2) food or refreshments of nominal value; (3) benefits resulting from the business or outside activities of the spouse of the Member, officer, or employee if such benefits are customarily provided to others; (4) pension and other benefits resulting from continued participation in an employee welfare and benefits plan maintained by a former employer; and (5) specified informational materials. Makes the gift restriction inapplicable under circumstances which make it clear that the gift is given for a nonbusiness purpose and is motivated by a family or close personal relationship. Sets forth factors to be considered in determining if the giving of the item is so motivated. Prohibits any Member, officer, or employee from knowingly accepting a gift from any other person (currently, such individuals may accept gifts totalling up to $250 from any one person, except as permitted by specified waivers).
