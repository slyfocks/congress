(Currently, such individuals are permitted to accept gifts of $100 or less and other gifts of greater value, subject to certain conditions.) Lists exceptions to such prohibition, including: (1) gifts motivated by a personal friendship rather than the position of the Member, officer, or employee (gifts over $250 are subject to a waiver by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct); (2) items that are not used and are returned to the donor; (3) items of little intrinsic value; (4) bequests, inheritances, and other transfers at death; (5) political contributions reported as required by law; (6) food, lodging, transportation, and entertainment provided on an official basis by Federal, State, and local governments; (7) informational materials sent to a Member's office; (8) nonmonetary awards, trophies, mementos, or honorary degrees; (8) consumable products provided to a Member's office by a home-State business which are primarily intended for consumption by persons other than the Member or staff; (9) awards and prizes given in events open to the public; (10) opportunities and benefits available to the public or Federal employees; (11) opportunities and benefits offered to members of a group in which membership is unrelated to congressional employment; and (12) opportunities and benefits based on outside business or employment activities when it is clear that such opportunities and benefits have not been offered or enhanced because of an individual's official status. Prohibits House Members, officers, or employees from accepting payments or reimbursements for: (1) meals or entertainment, with exceptions for meals or entertainment provided by a relative or friend or at widely attended gatherings; and (2) travel expenses from anyone (including a foreign government) other than a relative or friend. Subjects Members, officers, or employees who violate such gift restrictions to disciplinary action by the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct."
