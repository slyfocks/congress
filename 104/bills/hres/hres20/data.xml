  <summary>1/4/1995--Introduced.
Amends rule XLVII (regarding limitations on outside employment and earned income) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to include within the definition of "honorarium" copyright royalties, advances, or other forms of compensation (other than payments for actual expenses incurred for writing or editing) for the writing, editing, or creation of books, records, movies, other publications, or works of art during an individual's service as a House Member, officer, or employee. Prohibits such individuals from entering into contracts which would provide deferred compensation or royalties for works written or edited during such service. Repeals provisions which exclude copyright royalties received from established publishers pursuant to usual and customary contractual terms from the definition of "outside earned income."</summary>
