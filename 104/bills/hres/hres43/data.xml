  <summary>1/31/1995--Passed House amended.
Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to confer upon committee chairmen certain authorities currently relegated to committees regarding the announcement of committee hearings at least one week before commencement. Requires a committee chairman to make such announcement at the earliest possible date if he or she determines, with the concurrence of the ranking minority member, that there is good cause to begin the hearing sooner, or if the committee (with a quorum present) so determines by majority vote.</summary>
