  <summary>3/26/1996--Passed House amended.
Urges the Secretary of State to: (1) make human rights concerns among the primary objectives in bilateral relations with Cambodia; (2) closely monitor preparations for Cambodian elections in 1997 and 1998 and attempt to secure the agreement of the Cambodian Government to full and unhindered participation of international observers for such elections; (3) support the continuation of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the United Nations; and (4) encourage Cambodia's other donors and trading partners to raise human rights concerns with Cambodia. Supports efforts by the United States to provide assistance to Cambodia to broaden democratic civil society, to strengthen the rule of law, and to ensure that future elections in Cambodia are free and fair. Calls for the United States to raise human rights concerns at the June 1996 Donor's Consultative Meeting for Cambodia and during consideration of projects in Cambodia to be financed by international financial institutions.</summary>
