    "text": "Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to direct the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, upon the engrossment of any general appropriation bill or continuing appropriations resolution, to: (1) reduce the suballocation of the new budget authority, as well as the suballocation of outlays, to the appropriate subcommittees by the net amount of reductions resulting from any adopted House amendments; and (2) report those revisions to the House. Directs the chairman of the Budget Committee to make appropriate revisions in the allocations to the Appropriations Committee to reflect the revised suballocations and to report those revisions to the House. Amends rule XXI to require any appropriation bill marked up by the Appropriations Committee to contain a line item, called the \"Deficit Reduction Lock-box,\" setting forth a dollar amount not exceeding the amount by which the appropriate allocation of new budget authority exceeds the new budget authority provided by the bill as reported by that committee. Requires any appropriation bill reported by the Committee to contain a line item entitled \"Deficit Reduction Account\" comprised of an amount not to exceed the amount by which the appropriate allocation of new budget authority exceeds the amount of new budget authority provided by that bill (with specified exceptions applicable to the first appropriation bill considered after enactment of this resolution and to supplemental appropriation bills). Provides that whenever a Member offers an amendment to an appropriations bill to reduce spending, that reduction shall be placed in the deficit reduction lock-box unless the Member indicates the reduction should be utilized for another purpose."
