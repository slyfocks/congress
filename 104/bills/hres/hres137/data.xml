  <summary>5/2/1995--Introduced.
Condemns: (1) the use of violence and random terror for political purposes; (2) the exhortations to terror, murder, lawlessness and violence made by G. Gordon Liddy; and (3) the advocacy of, exhortation to, and preparation for such acts of violence as a significant threat to democracy and freedom. Reaffirms this Nation's commitment to free expression which does not preclude condemnation of irresponsible speech.</summary>
