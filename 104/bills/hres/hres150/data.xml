  <summary>5/16/1995--Introduced.
Declares that the House: (1) supports the President's efforts to reduce Japan's barriers to U.S. products, but believes that measures to achieve such goal must not result in an increase in the price of domestic goods for American consumers; (2) calls on U.S. domestic automobile manufacturers to refrain from raising prices as the consequence of any tariffs that may be imposed on imported Japanese motor vehicles; and (3) calls on the President to state his agreement with the above, and further state that an increase in domestic car prices would be inconsistent with the imposition of tariffs on imported Japanese motor vehicles, and that any such price increases would be unacceptable.</summary>
