Allows such legislation to change the Rules of the House and its organization, operations, and procedures, the congressional budget process, and relations between the Congress and the executive branch. Requires, during general debate in the House on a bill making appropriations for the legislative branch and pursuant to specific time set aside for that purpose, members of such Committee and other committees with jurisdiction over the legislative branch to be given time to conduct a general discussion of the functioning of the legislative branch, including House processes and procedures. Requires the Committee to include in its activities report submitted to the House under rule XI for a Congress: (1) an explanation, if appropriate, of why legislation to improve the functioning of the legislative branch was not submitted during that Congress; and (2) a separate and clearly identified section on the organization, operations, procedures, and workload of the House during such Congress."
