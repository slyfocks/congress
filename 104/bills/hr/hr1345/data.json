(Sec. 102) Authorizes Federal employees who become employed by the Authority within two months of separation from Federal service to have their Authority service treated as comparable to Federal service with respect to the Federal retirement system. Makes employees who elect the Federal system ineligible to participate in the District government retirement system. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Authority, notwithstanding the Freedom of Information Act and the Government in the Sunshine Act, to secure information necessary to carry out this Act from Federal agencies. Permits the Authority to seek judicial enforcement of its authority to carry out its responsibilities under this Act. Makes District employees who violate Authority orders or present or certify false or misleading information guilty of a misdemeanor as well as subject to administrative discipline. (Sec. 104) Exempts the Authority from liability for obligations of or claims against the District resulting from actions taken to carry out this Act. (Sec. 105) Requires actions against the Authority to be brought in the U.S. District Court for the District. Provides for expedited consideration of such actions in the courts involved. (Sec. 106) Requires the Authority to submit a proposed budget for each fiscal year to the President for inclusion in the annual budget for the District. Prohibits any amount from being obligated or expended by the Authority unless such amount has been approved by an Act of the Congress. Directs the Authority, as soon as practicable after the appointment of its members, to submit to the Mayor of the District and the President a request for reprogramming of funds previously appropriated for the District for auditing and consulting services and a description of anticipated Authority expenditures for FY 1995. Requires the Mayor to transfer such funds to the Authority for its activities. (Sec. 107) Suspends the Authority's activities upon the expiration of the 12-month period beginning on the date the Authority certifies that all obligations arising from the issuance by the Authority of bonds, notes, or other obligations have been discharged and all borrowings for short-term advances from the Treasury have been repaid. Reactivates the Authority upon initiation of a control period (as described by section 209) by the Appropriations Committees. (Sec. 108) Applies provisions of specified laws regarding open meetings, freedom of information, and conflict of interest to the Authority. Prohibits the District Mayor and the Council from exercising any control, oversight, or review over the Authority. Amends the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act to bar the Council from enacting any act, resolution, or rule with respect to the Authority. Title II: Responsibilities of Authority - Subtitle A: Establishment and Enforcement of Financial Plan and Budget for District Government - Directs the Mayor, for each fiscal year for which the District government is in a control period, to submit a financial plan and budget for the District to the Authority. Lists requirements for the financial plan and budget, including that they be submitted for the applicable fiscal year and next three fiscal years and that they meet standards to promote the financial stability of the District government. Describes such standards as follows: (1) in the case of the financial plan and budget for FY 1996, the District's expenditures for each fiscal year (beginning with FY 1999) may not exceed the District's revenues for such year; (2) during FY 1996 through 1998, the government shall make substantial progress towards equalizing its expenditures and revenues; (3) the government shall provide for the liquidation of the cumulative fund balance deficit; (4) if funds in government accounts dedicated for specific purposes have been withdrawn for other purposes, the government shall fully restore the funds to such accounts; and (5) the financial plan and budget shall assure the continuing long-term financial stability of the government. Repeals a provision of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1995 that requires the District to place portions of Federal payments in escrow to enforce certain spending reductions. (Sec. 202) Sets forth the process for the submission and approval of the financial plan and budget. Provides for review of the financial plan and budget by the Authority. Authorizes the Mayor to submit proposed revisions to the financial plan and budget for a control year (a year in which a financial plan and budget approved by the Authority is in effect) to the Authority at any time during the year.
