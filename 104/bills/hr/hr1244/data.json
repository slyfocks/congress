    "text": "Theatrical Motion Picture Authorship Act of 1995 - Declares that the principal director, screenwriter, and cinematographer of a theatrical motion picture have the noneconomic interests in such picture. Describes such interests as the right of the director, screenwriter, or cinematographer to: (1) claim that he or she was the director, screenwriter, or cinematographer of the picture; (2) prevent the use of his or her name as the director, screenwriter, or cinematographer of pictures of which he or she was not the director, screenwriter, or cinematographer; and (3) prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the picture which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation. Permits the exercise of such rights whether or not the person is the copyright owner. Requires the duration of such interests to be coextensive with (and expire at the same time as) exclusive copyright rights in the picture. Prohibits the transfer of such interests, but authorizes the exercise of such interests by heirs. Authorizes the waiver of such rights, but prohibits: (1) the execution of the written instrument containing the waiver before the first public performance of the motion picture; and (2) consideration exceeding one dollar to be given for the grant of the waiver. Revises copyright ownership provisions to provide that the principal director, screenwriter, and cinematographer shall be considered authors with respect to ownership of noneconomic interests in theatrical motion pictures. Considers violations of rights granted by this Act to be infringements."
