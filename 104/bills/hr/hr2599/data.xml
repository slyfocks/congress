(Sec. 107) Revises budget enforcement provisions with respect to: (1) enforced spending caps; (2) reporting excess spending; (3) Presidential orders to eliminate excess spending; (4) enforcing discretionary spending limits; (5) enforcing direct spending limits; and (6) certain exempt programs and activities.

Requires the President to notify the Congress of such a rescission or veto by special message after enactment of an appropriations Act providing such budget authority or a revenue or reconciliation Act containing a targeted tax benefit. Allows the President in each special message to propose to reduce the appropriate discretionary spending limit by an amount that does not exceed the total amount of discretionary budget authority rescinded by that message. Requires the President to submit a separate special message for each appropriations Act and for each revenue or reconciliation Act. Authorizes the President to rescind, under the terms of this Act, all or part of any unobligated discretionary budget authority provided by any FY 1996 appropriation Act, if the President notifies the Congress of such rescission by a special message not more than ten calendar days (excluding Sundays) after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 203) Makes such a rescission effective unless the Congress enacts a rescission-receipts disapproval bill. (Sec. 205) Specifies: (1) information to be included in the President's message; and (2) procedures to govern consideration of rescission-receipts disapproval legislation in the Senate and the House of Representatives. (Sec. 206) Requires the Comptroller General to report annually to the Congress: (1) a list of each proposed presidential rescission of discretionary budget authority and veto of a targeted tax benefit submitted through special messages for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year, together with their dollar value, and an indication of whether each rescission of discretionary budget authority or veto of a targeted tax benefit was accepted or rejected by Congress; (2) the total number of proposed presidential rescissions of discretionary budget authority and vetoes of a targeted tax benefit submitted through special messages for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year, together with their total dollar value; (3) the total number of presidential rescissions of discretionary budget authority or vetoes of a targeted tax benefit submitted through special messages for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year and approved by Congress, together with their total dollar value; (4) a list of rescissions of discretionary budget authority initiated by Congress for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year, together with their dollar value, and an indication of whether each such rescission was accepted or rejected by Congress; (5) the total number of rescissions of discretionary budget authority initiated and accepted by Congress for the fiscal year ending during the preceding calendar year, together with their total dollar value; and (6) a summary of the information provided by paragraphs (2), (3), and (5) for each of the ten fiscal years ending before the fiscal year during this calendar year.
