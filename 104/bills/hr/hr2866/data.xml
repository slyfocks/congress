  <summary>1/23/1996--Introduced.
Health Care Fraud Prosecution Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for: (1) knowingly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud to obtain a health care payment; or (2) presenting a statement as part of, or in support of, a claim for health care payment, knowing that such statement contains false or misleading information concerning any material fact. Limits such penalties to a fine and ten years' imprisonment, unless the offender knowingly or recklessly caused: (1) serious bodily injury to, or endangered the life of, an individual (up to 20 years' imprisonment); or (2) caused the death of an individual (up to life imprisonment). Sets forth provisions regarding illegal remunerations. Permits: (1) persons injured by violations of such provisions to recover treble damages in a civil action; and (2) the court to award the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees. Makes provisions regarding injunctions against fraud and criminal forfeiture of fraud proceeds applicable to health care fraud. Authorizes the Attorney General to pay specified rewards for information leading to the prosecution and conviction of persons engaging in health care fraud, with exceptions. Directs the Attorney General to establish: (1) regional health care fraud task forces and a data base for the reporting of final adverse actions against health care providers, suppliers, or practitioners; and (2) a national, toll-free health care fraud and abuse hotline. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997: (1) for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Attorneys, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services to hire, equip, and train personnel in connection with the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud cases; and (2) to establish, operate, and administer health care task forces and the national health care fraud and abuse data base and hotline and to publicize the data base and hotline. Amends the Federal criminal code to: (1) make activity which, if engaged in by the U.S. Postal Service, would be a violation of mail fraud provisions, punishable to the same extent with respect to private or commercial interstate carriers (express company fraud); and (2) establish health care fraud and express company fraud as predicates to violations of prohibitions against the laundering of monetary instruments.</summary>
