    "text": "Tobacco Health Tax and Agricultural Conversion Act of 1995 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the excise tax on: (1) cigars; (2) cigarettes; (3) cigarette papers and tubes; (4) snuff; and (5) chewing and pipe tobacco. Imposes an additional tax on packs of cigarettes containing fewer than 20 cigarettes. Provides an inflation adjustment of such tax rates. Imposes a tax on the floor stocks of such tobacco products which are removed before October 1, 1995. Imposes such tax on such products entered into the United States from foreign trade zones before such date. Requires tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes transferred or removed in bond from domestic factories and export warehouses (and thereby exempt from tax) to be appropriately labeled for export. Imposes a civil penalty on any person who sells, relands, or receives tobacco products labeled for export. Restricts the importation of previously exported tobacco products. Repeals the following exemptions from tax: (1) sales to employees of tobacco products manufacturers; (2) sales to the United States; and (3) books of cigarette papers containing 25 or fewer papers. Imposes minimum capacity or activity requirements (prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) for granting of a permit to commence business as a tobacco products manufacturer or export warehouse proprietor. Imposes an excise tax on the manufacture or importation of roll-your-own tobacco. Establishes in the Treasury the Tobacco Conversion and Health Education Trust Fund (consisting of a Tobacco Conversion Account and a Health Education Account), to which the Secretary shall transfer an amount equivalent to three percent of the net increase in revenues attributable to the tax increases imposed by this Act. Makes funds in the Tobacco Conversion Account available to: (1) assist farmers in converting from tobacco to other crops; and (2) provide grants and loans, including assistance to convert from tobacco production, to communities and persons involved in tobacco growing and tobacco product manufacture who are adversely affected by the tax increases in this Act. Makes funds in the Health Education Account available for expenditures to increase public awareness of health risks, including those of tobacco use. Establishes in the Treasury the National Fund for Medical Research, to which nine percent of the revenues resulting from the tax increases imposed by this Act shall be transferred for distribution to the member institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health. Transfers the balance of the revenues from these increases to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund."
