    "as": "Passed Senate amended",

    "text": "Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) to authorize appropriations for FY 1997 for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and for programs promoting the domestic renewable energy industry and related service industries. Revises the exclusivity requirements for international voluntary agreements to make EPCA requirements the sole procedures for implementing international emergency response provisions of such agreements, defined as the international petroleum allocation and information provisions currently covered, as well as specified additional emergency response measures. Changes from mandatory to discretionary the authority of the Attorney General to promulgate recordkeeping rules with respect to voluntary agreements and plans of action. Requires the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to make competition and small business impact reports to the President and the Congress at least annually (currently, semiannually), or once every six months during an international energy supply emergency. States that the antitrust defense under EPCA shall not extend to the international allocation of petroleum products unless allocation is required by the international energy program during an international energy supply emergency. Extends from June 30, 1996, to September 30, 1997, all authorities relating to: (1) domestic energy supply availability (including the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and contracting authority for foreign-owned petroleum products); and (2) energy emergency preparedness. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 for: (1) State energy conservation programs and the Federal financial and technical assistance in support of such programs; (2) grants for project costs and technical assistance to schools and hospitals for implementing approved energy conservation projects; and (3) the alternative fuels truck commercial application program. (Sec. 2) Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to authorize appropriations for FY 1997 for the weatherization program."
