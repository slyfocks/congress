Describes such certification as a certification that: (1) there is substantial progress toward the realization of a separate identity for Kosova, the right of the people of Kosova to govern themselves, and the creation of an international protectorate for Kosova; (2) there is substantial improvement in the human rights situation in Kosova; and (3) international human rights observers are allowed to return to Kosova and the government of Kosova is permitted to meet and carry out its mandate as elected representatives of the people of Kosova. Directs the President to report to the Congress on: (1) the situation in Kosova; (2) measures to provide humanitarian assistance to Kosova and Kosovar refugees; (3) recommendations on what modalities may be pursued; (4) the current status of U.S. efforts to establish a U.S. Information Agency cultural center in Kosova; and (5) the presence of U.S. officials in Kosova prior to establishment of such center."
