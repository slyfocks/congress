Authorizes the President to impose certain trade sanctions against any country that is not certified as having cooperated with the United States in preventing the flow of illegal narcotics from it. Requires the President to invoke all applicable defenses, including exceptions for measures necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health, if proceedings are initiated by a country against the United States in the World Trade Organization or under the North American Free Trade Agreement with respect to such trade sanctions."
