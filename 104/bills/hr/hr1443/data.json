Requires (current law authorizes) each U.S. district court to authorize by local rule the use of arbitration in civil actions. Increases (from $100,000 to $150,000) the limit in money damages with respect to cases referred to arbitration. Amends the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 regarding temporary judgeships to provide that the first vacancy in the office of district judge in each of a list of judicial districts occurring five years or more after the date on which the first appointment of a judge to that office is confirmed by the Senate shall not be filled."
