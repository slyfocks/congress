  <summary>9/30/1996--Introduced.
Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for specified activities relating to material: (1) constituting or containing child pornography, including knowingly possessing any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or other material that contains three or more images of child pornography (and enhances penalties if the offender has a prior Federal or State conviction relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, or for specified activities relating to child pornography (prior conviction)); and (2) depicting the sexual exploitation of minors, including knowingly mailing, or transporting or shipping in interstate or foreign commerce, including by computer, any visual depiction created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Revises the definition of "visual depiction" to include data stored on computer disk or by electronic means which is capable of conversion into a visual image. Defines "identifiable minor" to mean a person who was a minor at the time the visual depiction was created, adapted, or modified or whose image as a minor was used in creating, adapting, or modifying such depiction and who is recognizable by the person's face, likeness, or other distinguishing characteristic (but proof of the actual identity of such minor is not required). Increases and expands the scope of penalties for sexual exploitation of children. Revises provisions regarding activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors, including providing enhanced penalties for offenders having a prior conviction. Amends the Privacy Protection Act of 1980 to authorize certain searches and seizures of work product materials and other documents if an offense involves the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography, or the sale or purchase of children. Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act of 1996 - Modifies code provisions regarding aggravated sexual abuse and sexual abuse of a minor, including by: (1) setting penalties for crossing a State line with intent to engage in a sexual act with a person under age 12; and (2) providing for life imprisonment (unless the death penalty is imposed) for violation of such provisions if the defendant has previously been convicted of specified Federal or State offenses involving aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse of a minor.</summary>
