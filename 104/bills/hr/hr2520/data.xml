(Sec. 102) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) to authorize financial services holding companies (FSHCs) to own shares of a securities affiliate. (Sec. 103) Delineates activities permissible for securities affiliates. Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) to consider the need for securities firms affiliated with banks to be innovative and competitive when it makes determinations of "permissible activities." Cites circumstances under which the Board may permit an FSHC to: (1) acquire more than five percent of, or all or substantially all of, the voting shares or assets of a securities affiliate; (2) make additional investments that are considered capital for purposes of statutory capital requirements in a securities affiliate under its control; and (3) permit its securities affiliate to underwrite or deal in any security for a maximum aggregate period of two years. Prohibits any FSHC acquisition of any securities affiliate or any additional investment in such an affiliate unless the Board has received full payment of the application fee. Excludes a securities affiliate's assets and liabilities (except those related to nonsecurities activities) from the determination of whether an FSHC is adequately capitalized. States that such exclusion shall not apply, however, to an investment bank holding company predominantly engaged in securities activities on a consolidated basis. Prohibits a FSHC that acquires control of a securities affiliate from permitting any depository institution (or its subsidiary), except for certain Edge Act and agreement corporations, from engaging in underwriting securities backed by or representing interests in obligations or pools of obligations originated or purchased by the institution or its affiliates. Requires the Board to deny any notice or application by an FSHC to engage in, or acquire shares of a company engaged in, underwriting or dealing in securities in the United States, unless such activity is permissible for a national bank. Treats certain participants in a bankers' bank holding company as subsidiaries. Cites circumstances under which an FSHC may acquire shares and ownership interests in connection with underwriting and investment banking activities without prior Board approval. Requires any FSHC to pay an annual registration fee with respect to each securities affiliate and company or other entity it controls which has acquired shares, assets, or ownership interests as part of a bona fide underwriting or investment banking activity. (Sec. 104) Delineates conditions under which: (1) a well capitalized insured depository institution may extend credit to acquire or sell securities, or enhance the marketability of securities underwritten by a securities affiliate; and (2) an FSHC or its subsidiary may extend credit or make payments to finance the purchase of a security underwritten by one of its securities affiliates. Directs the Board to promulgate regulations under which directors and senior executive officers of a securities affiliate may serve simultaneously in the same capacity at an affiliated depository institution (management interlocks). Sets forth disclosure requirements for securities affiliates and insured depository institutions. Sets restrictions upon the underwriting by an securities affiliate of securities representing obligations originated by an affiliated depository institution. Prescribes guidelines under which each appropriate Federal banking agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shall establish information sharing and compliance programs and coordinate their activities to enforce this Act. Identifies conditions (foreign bank firewalls) under which the uninsured wholesale operations of foreign banks are exempt from the restrictions relating to securities affiliates. Amends the Federal Reserve Act to extend the time period during which a member bank is prohibited from acquiring a security if a principal underwriter in the selling syndicate is a bank affiliate. Amends the Federal Power Act to exempt from its prohibition against interlocking directorates certain persons currently serving or proposing to serve as directors or officers of a public utility and a banking firm permitted to underwrite or participate in the marketing of public utility securities, if that banking firm does not underwrite or participate in the marketing of securities of the same public utility. Amends the Right to Financial Privacy Act to permit the supervisory agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and the SEC to exchange examination reports. Amends the BHCA of 1956 to authorize the Board to promulgate regulations for the protection of depository institutions and for the separation of banking and commerce. (Sec. 105) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act to set forth circumstances under which securities companies that become FSHCs may retain ownership of financial and nonfinancial companies. Restricts joint marketing of products or services between an insured depository institution and an affiliate owned by an FSHC. (Sec. 106) Identifies circumstances under which qualified limited purpose banks are exempt from: (1) asset growth restrictions; (2) new activities' restrictions; (3) cross-marketing restrictions; and (4) divestiture requirements. Prescribes guidelines for the conversion of certain nonbank holding companies to FSHC status. (Sec. 107) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to set forth parameters within which certain insured depository institutions may be affiliates of a securities underwriter or dealer. Requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to: (1) study and report to the Congress on the risks posed to the deposit insurance funds by the affiliation of insured depository institutions with securities affiliates; and (2) factor into semiannual assessments any increased risk to the funds that it finds are caused by such affiliations. (Sec. 108) Amends the International Banking Act of 1978 to authorize the Board to set a termination date for any grandfathered authority conferred upon a foreign bank or company following Board approval of its application under this Act to control a securities affiliate. (Sec. 109) Amends the BHCA of 1956 to preclude the States from prohibiting or limiting: (1) bank or FSHC affiliation with a securities affiliate solely because such affiliate is engaged in specified securities activities; or (2) activities of an FSHC subsidiary solely because the FSHC is no longer exempt under the BHCA. (Sec. 110) Amends the FDIA to direct the appropriate Federal banking agencies to jointly prescribe standards applicable to certain insured depository institutions that conduct transactions in securities issued by an investment company or annuities. Requires such standards to be comparable to the standards applicable to brokers and dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 unless the appropriate Federal banking agencies jointly determine that implementation of comparable standards is not necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, or the protection of investors, or is not in the public interest. Subtitle B: Investment Bank Holding Companies - Amends the BHCA of 1956 to: (1) establish a new category known as "investment bank holding company" (IBHC); and (2) delineate permissible affiliations for investment bank holding companies. Prohibits the use of Federal deposit insurance funds for a wholesale financial institution (certain uninsured State member banks), or an IBHC. (Sec. 116) Prescribes guidelines under which foreign banks may be treated as IBHCs and for reciprocal national treatment and coordination with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). (Sec. 117) Amends the Federal Reserve Act to prescribe procedural guidelines for membership as a wholesale financial institution in the Federal Reserve System. Amends the FDIA to prescribe a procedure by which an insured State-chartered bank or a national bank may voluntarily terminate its status as an insured depository institution. Requires any such terminated bank to become a wholesale financial institution in order to accept any deposits. Subtitle C: Financial Activities - Amends the BHCA of 1956 to exempt from its proscription against interests in nonbanking organizations any activity that the Board determines to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. (Sec. 121) Repeals the mandate that the Board consider, when determining whether a particular activity is a proper incident to banking, if its performance by a bank holding company affiliate is such that the public interest benefit outweighs any possible adverse effects (such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices). Permits Board regulations to differentiate between activities commenced by affiliates of different classes of banks. (Sec. 122) Sets forth criteria for statutory approval, without prior notice to the Board, of proposals by well capitalized and well managed FSHCs to engage in specified transactions and acquisitions. Sets forth expedited procedures for FSHCs to acquire companies engaged in new activities. (Sec. 123) Revises FSHC examination and reporting requirements. (Sec. 124) Sets forth a statutory scheme for reduced supervision of FSHCs controlling principally nondepository institutions. (Sec. 125) Sets forth a procedure for the conversion of unitary savings and loan holding companies to FSHC status without prior Board approval. (Sec. 126) Establishes the Financial Services Advisory Committee to confer with regulators regarding the impact of this Act upon the financial services industry and to report semi-annually to certain congressional committees concerning its activities and recommendations. (Sec. 128) Renames the BHCA of 1956 as the Financial Services Holding Company Act of 1995. (Sec. 130) States that corporate credit cards are not commercial loans (thus permitting credit card banks to issue corporate credit cards, a practice currently proscribed). (Sec. 131) Authorizes the Board to extend from five years to up to ten years the period during which a bank holding company may retain shares acquired in a loan foreclosure, if: (1) the bank holding company has made a good faith attempt to dispose of such shares during the initial five-year period; or (2) disposal of such shares during the initial five-year period would have been detrimental to the company. Subtitle D: Interagency Banking and Financial Services Advisory Committee - Establishes the Interagency Banking and Financial Services Advisory Committee to improve the supervision, efficiency, and competitiveness of the financial services industry and make related recommendations to Federal agencies and the Congress. Subtitle E: Application and Registration Fees - Amends the BHCA of 1956 to authorize the Board to impose administrative fees upon FSHCs. Title II: Functional Regulation - Subtitle A: Brokers and Dealers - Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to define specified banks as "brokers" and "dealers" (current law excludes banks from such definition). (Sec. 203) Authorizes the SEC to exempt any person from the definition of "broker" or "dealer" if it finds such exemption is consistent with the purposes of this Act. (Sec. 204) Exempts loans made by a member bank to a broker or dealer from Board-prescribed margin requirements if the loan proceeds are to be used in the ordinary course of business (other than for the purpose of funding securities purchases for the account of such broker or dealer). Permits a broker-dealer to borrow from any person that agrees to comply with Federal Reserve Act strictures governing the use of credit to finance securities transactions. Subtitle B: Bank Investment Company Activities - Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to permit: (1) custody of investment company assets by an affiliated bank; and (2) a unit investment trust to designate an affiliated bank as trustee (currently a prohibited practice). (Sec. 211) Permits the SEC to bring a civil action against a custodian for a registered investment company for breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct. (Sec. 212) Prohibits an investment company from knowingly acquiring a security during an underwriting or selling syndicate if the registration statement, or any other offering document pursuant to which the security is offered, states that any material part of the proceeds will be used to discharge indebtedness owed to the adviser of such registered investment company or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the adviser. (Sec. 213) States that an affiliate of an investment company for a bank must comply with SEC rules when lending money to an investment company. (Sec. 214) Modifies the definition of "interested person" to identify transactions, services, and loans taking place during the preceding six months which would make a person an affiliated person of a broker or dealer. Prohibits a registered investment company from having a majority of its board of directors consisting of personnel or senior officers of the subsidiaries of any one bank, or of any single FSHC (and its affiliates and subsidiaries). (Sec. 215) Modifies the guidelines pertaining to unlawful misrepresentation of guarantees and the deceptive use of names. (Sec. 216) Modifies the definition of "broker" to state that it does not include any person solely by reason of the fact that such person is an underwriter for one or more investment companies. (Sec. 217) Modifies the definition of "dealer" to exclude an insurance or an investment company. (Sec. 218) Amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to modify the definitions of investment adviser to remove the exclusion from such definition of an investment adviser for banks that advise investment companies. Revises the definitions of broker and dealer. (Sec. 221) Mandates interagency consultation between the appropriate Federal banking agency and the SEC regarding examination results and other information pertaining to the investment advisory activities of any registered FSHC and its separately identifiable departments or divisions. (Sec. 222) Amends the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to revise the exclusion from their purview of certain bank common trust funds to specify the exclusion of any interest or participation in any common trust fund or similar fund that is excluded from the definition of "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to revise such exclusion guidelines for certain bank common trust funds. (Sec. 223) Amends the Investment Company Act of 1940 to prescribe circumstances under which an investment adviser holding shares of an investment company in a fiduciary capacity must transfer the power to vote such shares to the beneficial owners or to another fiduciary who is not an affiliate of such adviser. Title III: Bank Insurance Activities - Amends the Revised Statutes (National Bank Act) to declare that nothing in specified Federal banking regulatory law may be construed as limiting State authority to regulate the insurance activities of national banks. Prohibits the States from imposing discriminatory insurance regulatory and licensing requirements upon national banks, unless there is a legitimate and reasonable State regulatory purpose for a requirement for which there is no less restrictive alternative. (Sec. 302) Authorizes the Comptroller of the Currency to approve the application of a national bank with a main office or full-service bank in an empowerment zone to act as agent or broker from such office or branch for an insurance company if: (1) the bank provides sufficient evidence that competitively priced insurance in its empowerment zone is inadequate; and (2) the insurance is sold only in such empowerment zone. Authorizes the Comptroller to: (1) prescribe regulations governing sales of insurance by national banks; and (2) enforce State law with respect to a national bank. Title IV: Reductions in Government Overregulation - Subtitle A: The Home Mortgage Process - Amends the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) to: (1) transfer certain rulemaking authority over disclosure requirements from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board); and (2) declare that the purpose of the Act is to eliminate kickbacks or referrals without directly regulating settlement services prices or wages to bona fide employees that are not designed as a subterfuge to facilitate kickbacks among affiliated companies. (Sec. 401) Precludes the Secretary of HUD from publishing a proposed or final regulation unless the Secretary has used a certain negotiated rulemaking procedure to attempt to negotiate and develop the rule. Distributes administrative enforcement authority regarding kickbacks and referrals among HUD, the Federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, the Board, and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Mandates that such agencies cooperate with one another in developing enforcement guidelines. Declares a statutory preference for administrative enforcement over criminal enforcement, except in appropriate cases. Restricts criminal sanctions to willful violations of law (current law penalizes unwillful and unintentional violations as well). Redesignates "a controlled business arrangement" as "an affiliated business arrangement". Repeals mandates for projects demonstrating: (1) a land parcel recordation system; and (2) preparation of statements of settlement costs for insertion into special information booklets. (Sec. 402) Sets a deadline by which the Board must take action under RESPA and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) to simplify and provide a single format for credit transaction disclosures. (Sec. 403) Exempts from TILA disclosure requirements any transactions that the Board determines: (1) are not necessary to effectuate the Act's purposes; or (2) do not provide a measurable benefit in the form of useful information or consumer protection. (Sec. 404) Amends RESPA to repeal requirements that for certain federally related mortgage loans the lender disclose: (1) that it has previously assigned, sold, or transferred the servicing of such loans, or, during the most recent three-year period, a specified percentage of them; and (2), in the case of a lender who does not service federally related loans, a present intent to assign, sell or transfer them. Repeals the mandate for model disclosure statements. Excises from the definition of "federally related mortgage loan" any loan secured by a subordinate lien on residential real property (thereby removing second mortgages from RESPA requirements). Directs the Board to ensure that regulations pertaining to the business credit exemption from RESPA jurisdiction include all business credit exempted from TILA. (Sec. 405) Amends TILA to revise disclosure requirements to permit alternative disclosures for adjustable rate home mortgages which state that a monthly payment may increase or decrease significantly due to annual percentage rate increases. (Current law requires illustrations how a rate increase or decrease affects monthly payments). Grants creditors the option of disclosing, in any variable interest rate residential mortgage transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with greater than a one-year term, either a statement that the monthly payment may change substantially, or an historical example illustrating the effects of interest rate changes implemented according to the loan program. Mandates additional disclosures pertaining to note rates and points for residential mortgage transactions, and a statement that the terms are subject to change. (Sec. 406) Treats as a finance charge certain voluntary noninsurance debt cancellation and deficiency waiver contracts with respect to a debtor's liability for amounts in excess of the value of the collateral securing the debtor's obligation, unless the debtor furnishes the creditor with a certain statement about such a contract. (Sec. 407) Revises certain TILA provisions for recovery of fees. (Sec. 408) Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to repeal the mandate for homeownership debt counseling availability notification. (Sec. 409) Amends the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 to increase the maximum asset-size of institutions exempt from its purview from $10 million to $50 million. Authorizes the Board to exempt from the Act's disclosure requirements institutions whose asset-size is over $50 million if the burden of compliance outweighs the usefulness of the requisite information, unless it is reasonable to believe that the institution is not fulfilling its obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and neighborhoods in which it is located. Declares that a depository institution shall be deemed to have satisfied the public availability notification requirements for its mortgage loan transactions if its branch offices provide notice of the availability upon request of the information from the home office. Subtitle B: Community Reinvestment Act Amendments - Amends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) to revise the expression of congressional intent to prohibit a supervisory agency from imposing additional burden, recordkeeping, or reporting when examining financial institutions. (Sec. 422) Requires the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency, in assessing and taking into account the records of a regulated financial institution for purposes of CRA compliance, to consider as a positive factor the institution's investments and loans to: (1) any minority or women's depository institution or low-income credit union; (2) any joint ventures, entities, or projects providing benefits to distressed communities (regardless of whether or not the recipient institutions or communities are located within the regulated financial institution's chartered service area); and (3) targeted low- and moderate-income communities, including real property loans to such communities. Specifies other related positive factors to be considered. (Sec. 423) Prohibits regulations requiring additional CRA recordkeeping and loan data collection. (Sec. 424) Applies a requirement of metropolitan area distinctions, with respect to the public section of written institution evaluations, only to institutions that maintain domestic branches in two or more States. (Sec. 425) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the appropriate congressional committees should exercise aggressive oversight of the adoption and implementation of any CRA regulation by a Federal supervisory agency after the date of enactment of this Act. Requires such an agency to report to the Congress on the implementation of all CRA regulations. (Sec. 426) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to direct each Federal banking agency to ensure that its banking examiners consult on examination activities and resolve any inconsistent recommendations given to a depository institution.
