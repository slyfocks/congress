Establishes in the Treasury the Radiation Experimentation Compensation Trust Fund for compensating the subjects of experiments conducted between January 1, 1940, and December 31, 1974, during which the subjects were intentionally injected with plutonium or zirconium, or exposed to total body radiation, without their informed consent. Authorizes appropriations. Directs the Attorney General to establish procedures for the submission of claims and for payment from amounts in the Fund of each claim meeting the requirements of this Act. Provides for payments in cases of deceased experimental subjects. States that payments under this Act which are accepted by a subject or the subject's survivors shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of or on behalf of the subject against the United States arising out of the subject's participation in the experiment. Provides that a payment under this Act shall not affect any claim against an insurance carrier with respect to insurance or against any person with respect to workers' compensation. Provides for judicial review of denied claims. Establishes a time limit for the filing of claims of 20 years after enactment of this Act."
