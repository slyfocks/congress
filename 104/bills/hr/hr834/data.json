Declares that, on and after the first day of the first Congress beginning after the next election of Representatives, the rate of basic pay for each such office or position shall be equal to the rate which would then be payable if neither of specified sections of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 and the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1992 had been enacted. Repeals certain related provisions of such Acts. Requires adjustment, on the day after such day, in the rate of pay for: (1) judicial branch offices and positions in general, according to applicable Federal law; and (2) district court judges in particular, so that theirs shall be equal to the rate payable to a Senator or Member of the House (or the lesser of these, if such rates are not the same). Amends the Federal Salary Act of 1967 to repeal the mandate and authorization for the Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation, thus abolishing it."
