  <summary>6/16/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Federal judicial code to make an exception to foreign sovereign immunity in cases in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death or economic harm that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources to terrorists. Specifies that such an action shall not be maintained unless: (1) the claimant first affords the foreign state a reasonable opportunity to arbitrate the claim in accordance with accepted international rules of arbitration; and (2) the act upon which the claim is based occurred while the individual bringing the claim was a U.S. national and while a determination was in effect under the Export Administration Act of 1979 or the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 that the government of that foreign state repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Makes an exception to immunity from attachment or execution where the judgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune under this Act, regardless of whether the property is or was involved with the act upon which the claim is based.</summary>
