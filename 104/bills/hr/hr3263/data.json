Directs each State or political subdivision to require all applicants for such positions, before beginning employment, to: (1) disclose all prior service or employment as an officer; and (2) submit a written authorization and request for release of such information. Directs the Attorney General, when a prospective employer obtains an applicant's request, to release data collected pursuant to this Act to the employer. Makes agencies or agency administrators who submit employment or officer certification data pursuant to this Act immune from civil liability for such disclosure or its consequences, except upon a showing of lack of good faith by clear and convincing evidence."
