Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers Employment Registration Act of 1996 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Governor of each State or the chief executive officer of each U.S. territory (State) that receives drug control and system improvement formula grants to designate an official or agency which shall: (1) submit to an officer or agency designated by the Attorney General a list of all law enforcement and correctional officers who held such office in such State on or since January 1, 1990 (including their dates of birth, social security numbers, Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint identification numbers, dates of service, names and addresses, or National Crime Information Center numbers of the appointing or employing agencies); and (2) notify such agency or official of the employment or separation of such an officer. Directs each State or political subdivision to require all applicants for such positions, before beginning employment, to: (1) disclose all prior service or employment as an officer; and (2) submit a written authorization and request for release of such information. Directs the Attorney General, when a prospective employer obtains an applicant's request, to release data collected pursuant to this Act to the employer. Makes agencies or agency administrators who submit employment or officer certification data pursuant to this Act immune from civil liability for such disclosure or its consequences, except upon a showing of lack of good faith by clear and convincing evidence.</summary>
