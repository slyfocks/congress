Title II: Amendment to Congressional Budget Act of 1974 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require that any budget submitted by the congressional Budget Committees not be in deficit.

Requires each concurrent resolution on the budget to contain reconciliation directives necessary to implement the resolution. Sets forth requirements for the Committee on Rules of the House of Representatives, if it reports any rule or order providing for the consideration of any concurrent resolution on the budget. Makes it always in order in the Senate to consider a budget resolution consisting of the text of a budget submitted by the President.
