  <summary>6/6/1996--Passed House amended.
Provides that upon presentation by the State of Wisconsin of their plan for the "Wisconsin Works" (welfare reform) demonstration project to the appropriate Federal official for any Federal entitlement program specified in the plan: (1) such official is deemed to have waived compliance with the requirements of Federal law with respect to such program, to the extent and for the period necessary to enable the State to carry out the demonstration project; and (2) the costs of carrying it out which would not otherwise be included as program expenditures shall be regarded as program expenditures, except to the extent that the sum of such costs and the expenditures of the State under all such programs during any testing period exceeds the total amount that would be expended under such programs during such testing period in the absence of the demonstration project. Provides for the recapture of excess amounts under certain conditions. States that this Act shall not have any effect on certain other waivers granted to Wisconsin before enactment of this Act, and that the current waivers are considered a precondition and can be subsumed as part of the Wisconsin Works demonstration. Provides that if, after enactment of this Act, any Federal law is enacted which modifies the terms of, or the amounts of expenditures permitted under, any program to which this Act applies, Wisconsin may elect to participate in such program as so modified.</summary>
