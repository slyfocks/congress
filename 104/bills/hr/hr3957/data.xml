  <summary>8/2/1996--Introduced.
FCC Modernization Act of 1996 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prepare a plan to: (1) adjust the allocation of FCC personnel to reflect competitive policies adopted by the United States; (2) propose the automation or privatization of routine FCC functions, as well as the termination of unnecessary functions; (3) reduce FCC management and overhead expenses; and (4) prepare the FCC for rapid response to changes in technologies and markets. (Sec. 3) Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize the FCC to delegate to advisory coordinating committees its authority to grant licenses and permits for stations in the private mobile communications services. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the FCC to require the filing by any carrier of any contract, agreement, or arrangement. (Currently, every such carrier is required to make such filings.) (Sec. 5) Repeals provisions of the Act: (1) prohibiting any person from holding the position of officer or director of more than one carrier subject to the Act, unless authorized by the FCC; and (2) authorizing the FCC to undertake valuations, and require inventories, of carrier property. (Sec. 7) Terminates the FCC's authority to prohibit the construction of a new line, or the extension of a line, of communications service by a carrier without such carrier first obtaining a certificate of permission from the FCC. Delays the effective date of such termination with respect to the construction, extension, or acquisition of any line for foreign communications. Provides that a common carrier's application for a waiver of specified regulations in connection with an acquisition of the lines of another carrier shall be deemed approved six months after submission unless the FCC finds that the application is not in the public interest. (Sec. 8) Repeals provisions of the Act: (1) requiring the FCC to examine common carrier transactions relating to the furnishing of equipment, supplies, and services in order to determine the effect of such transactions on fees charged by such carriers; and (2) authorizing the FCC to inquire into the management of the business of all carriers subject to the Act. (Sec. 10) Requires each telecommunications carrier to file annually with the FCC its financial report to shareholders, as well as related documents and information. (Currently, the FCC is authorized to require certain reports from such carriers.) (Sec. 11) Terminates the FCC's authority to provide preferential treatment in licensing procedures to persons who make significant contributions to the development of a new telecommunication service or the development of new technologies that substantially enhance an existing service. (Sec. 12) Repeals provisions of the Act relating to: (1) the use of naval radio stations for broadcasting commercial messages; and (2) FCC allocation of very high frequency stations and AM radio stations. (Sec. 14) Provides for deposit into the Treasury of fees charged by Federal departments and agencies for use of property, rights-of-way, and easements. (Sec. 15) Prohibits the FCC Chairman, for two years after the enactment of this Act, from travelling more than 50 miles from the District of Columbia while on official business.</summary>
