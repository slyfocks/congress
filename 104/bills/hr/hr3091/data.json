    "text": "Injunctive Relief Amendments Act of 1996 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to revise provisions relating to the awarding of preliminary injunctive relief against individuals for alleged unfair labor practices. Allows parties against whom such preliminary injunctive relief is sought an opportunity to review and respond to legal memoranda or documents presented to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in support of such relief. Prohibits Federal courts from issuing preliminary injunctive relief unless: (1) there is a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of the complaint; (2) there is a possibility of irreparable harm if relief is not granted; (3) a balancing of hardships favors injunctive relief; and (4) harm to the public interest stemming from such relief is tolerable in light of the benefits achieved."
