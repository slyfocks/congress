    "text": "Enterprise Capital Formation Act of 1995 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow an exclusion of 75 percent (currently, 50 percent) of the gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held more than five years. Removes provisions restricting that exclusion to noncorporate taxpayers. Prohibits treating stock of a member of a parent-subsidiary controlled group as qualified while held by another member of such group. Removes provisions listing the excluded amounts as items of tax preference for purposes of alternative minimum tax. Changes the requirements for a business to qualify as a small business for these purposes. Removes provisions relating to a per-issuer limitation on a taxpayer's eligible gain. Modifies the working capital requirements of the active business requirement. Applies the amendments made by this Act to any qualified stock issued after August 10, 1993, if the taxpayer so elects."
