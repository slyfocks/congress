(Sec. 2) Makes eligible for medical services on an ambulatory or outpatient basis, notwithstanding that there is insufficient medical evidence to conclude that such disability may be associated with the described exposure, any disabled veteran who the Secretary finds: (1) may have been exposed to dioxin or was exposed to a toxic substance found in a herbicide or defoliant used for military purposes during the Vietnam era while serving on active duty in Vietnam; (2) was exposed while serving on active duty to ionizing radiation from the detonation of a nuclear device in connection with such veteran's participation in the test of such a device or with the American occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, from September 11, 1945, through July 1, 1946; or (3) may have been exposed to a toxic substance or environmental hazard while serving on active duty in Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War. Prohibits the provision of such medical services: (1) for any disability that is found to have resulted from a cause other than the exposure described; or (2) after December 31, 1996. Repeals a provision regarding the order of priority for furnishing ambulatory or outpatient medical services for veterans.
