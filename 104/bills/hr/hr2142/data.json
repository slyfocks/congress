(Sec. 103) Instructs the Secretary of Energy to transmit to certain congressional committees the criteria to be used in making proposals for mission assignments and the streamlining of departmental laboratories. Requires the Comptroller General to report a detailed analysis of the Secretary's proposals and procedures to certain congressional committees. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to: (1) complete the mission assignments and streamlining of all laboratories as outlined in the proposals by a specified deadline; and (2) transmit a status report to certain congressional committees as part of the annual budget request. Title II: Governance - Declares that DOE shall implement, but not be the agency of enforcement of, Federal, State, and local environmental, safety, and health promulgations at departmental laboratories unless the Secretary certifies that a particular action is unique to departmental activities and necessary for human health and safety."
