  <summary>7/25/1996--Introduced.
Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1996 - Amends Federal aviation law to require the operator of each major airport to use dogs or other appropriate animals in screening passengers and cargo for the purpose of detecting plastic explosives and other materials which may be used in aircraft piracy and which cannot be detected by metal detectors. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary of Transportation's authority to make grants for the training and evaluation of dogs for the explosive detection K-9 team training program for detecting explosives at airports and aboard aircraft. Requires the Secretary to extend such program to the largest 50 airports, as determined by the number of passenger enplanements in 1995. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
