Sets limits on such recoveries. Establishes an Individual Privacy Protection Board to: (1) study the data banks, automated data processing programs, and information systems of public and private organizations to determine standards and procedures in force for the protection of personal information; (2) recommend to the President and the Congress the extent to which provisions of the Privacy Act should be applied to such organizations; (3) develop guidelines and provide continuing assistance for, and investigate compliance with, individual records maintenance requirements; (4) review Federal law, Executive orders, regulations, directives, and judicial decisions and report on their consistency with the rights of privacy, due process of law, and other guarantees in the Constitution; and (5) comment on the implications for data protection of proposed Federal, State, or local statutes, regulations, or procedures. Provides penalties for violations of privacy rights."
