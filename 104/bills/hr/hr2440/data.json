    "text": "(Sec. 1) Amends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 to modify notice requirements regarding releases of extremely hazardous substances (or releases of other substances subject to Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) notification requirements) to require notification by the owner or operator of the facility at which the chemical is produced, used, or stored to emergency planning officials within one hour of having knowledge (under current law, \"immediately\") that a release has occurred. Permits an exception to the one hour requirement in the event of unusual or extenuating circumstances. Allows such notice to be given (in addition to the community emergency coordinator and State emergency planning commission, as under current law) to a State agency authorized by State law to receive the notification and requires such an agency to then notify the State emergency response commission within two hours. (Sec. 2) Amends CERCLA to modify notice requirements regarding releases of hazardous substances to require notification by the person in charge of the vessel or facility within one hour of having knowledge of the release (under current law, \"as soon as he has knowledge\"). Allows such notice to be given (in addition to the National Response Center established under the Clean Water Act, as under current law) to the State emergency response commission or a State agency authorized by State law to receive the notification. Requires the National Response Center to convey the notification to all appropriate government agencies within two hours and provides a similar time period for notification of the Center or both the Center and the commission if first received by the emergency response commission or the authorized State agency, respectively. Allows an exception to the one hour requirement similar to the one provided by the right-to-know amendments of this Act. Revises penalties for failure to notify to conform with this Act's amendments."
