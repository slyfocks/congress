    "text": "Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act of 1995 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, with respect to payments for medical and other health services, to cover services which would be physicians' services if furnished by a physician but: (1) which are performed by a clinical nurse specialist working in collaboration with a physician; and (2) which the clinical nurse specialist is legally authorized to perform by the State. Eliminates the requirement, with respect to such services performed by a nurse practitioner, that they be performed in a skilled nursing facility or other specified nursing facility. Covers, in addition, other services and supplies incidental to such services. Revises the formula for payment from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for such services (thereby increasing such payment). Repeals the rural area restriction on services performed by nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists for which direct payment may be made. Requires a ten percent bonus payment from the Fund for services of a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist furnished in a health professional shortage area."
