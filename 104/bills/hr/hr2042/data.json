Requires such Secretaries to submit to the Congress a report on the results of such investigation. Requires the Secretary of State to recommend to the Congress appropriate modifications of the relationship between the United States and Kuwait if Kuwait has failed to remedy any improper financial, commercial, or legal practices."
