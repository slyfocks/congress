Durham Woods Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1995 - Amends Federal pipeline safety law to instruct the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations requiring: (1) periodic inspections of gas pipeline facilities with the use of instrumented internal inspection devices at least once every seven years in high-density population areas; and (2) transmission pipeline operators to institute a monthly inspection program for leaks and other specified hazards and line markers along pipeline rights-of-way. (Sec. 3) Declares it is a criminal offense to fail to report damage to a gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility after knowingly and willfully engaging in excavation activities without taking specified steps to establish the location of underground facilities. (Sec. 4) Increases the civil and criminal penalties for violations of such law. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to: (1) make grants to the States to promote public awareness programs regarding the dangers of excavating near gas pipelines; (2) study and report to the Congress on the safety of all gas transmission pipelines in the State of New Jersey and on an assessment of the risks to public safety and the environment posed by gas pipeline transportation; and (3) develop a comprehensive mapping program to identify the specific location of all gas and hazardous liquid transmission pipelines , and gathering lines, in the country.</summary>
