State Medicaid Savings Incentive Act of 1995 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to authorize incentive payments to States that achieve a rate of growth for Medicaid expenditures for a fiscal year which is less than a baseline rate for such year determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Makes an incentive payment equal to the amount that is 20 percent of the difference between the amount that the Federal Government would have paid if State expenditures had increased by the baseline rate and the amount paid using the actual growth rate.</summary>
