  <summary>12/6/1995--Introduced.
Work and Family Integration Act - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to revise the 40-hour maximum workweek provision to allow employees to work flexible work schedules of 160 hours in any combination over a four-week period before employers would have to pay overtime compensation. Allows employees to request, and employers to provide, compensatory time-and-a-half off in lieu of compensatory overtime pay. Requires that any flexible work arrangement be agreed upon by both the employee and the employer, without coercion. Provides that collective bargaining agreements would remain unaffected. Allows former employees a priority in rehiring if they take time off for up to five years in order to take care of their children or parents. Provides that such an employee's priority treatment may not be used as a basis for an action against the employer for violation of Federal equal protection laws. Revises the salaried employee overtime exemption to allow flexible work schedules under such exemption. Amends Federal civil service law to revise the definition of compressed schedule to conform with that under this Act.</summary>
