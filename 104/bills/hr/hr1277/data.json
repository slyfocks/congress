Requires the President by rule to issue guidelines: (1) for assessing whether a proposed agency action will have the potential for taking private property or imposing a negative impact on private property; and (2) minimizing that taking or impact wherever possible. Requires each agency to issue rules implementing such guidelines. Directs the President, after affording the public notice and an opportunity to comment, to report to the Congress on each agency's compliance with this Act along with any recommendations for additional legislative or administrative action to minimize the taking of private property by the Federal Government. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report to the Congress on the effect of this Act on the farm economy and agricultural production of the United States."
