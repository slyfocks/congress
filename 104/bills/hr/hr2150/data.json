    "text": "Small Business Credit Efficiency Act of 1995 - Amends the Small Business Act to increase, from four to five tenths of one percent of the outstanding principal balance of a loan guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the amount which may be charged as a fee for loan guarantees sold on the secondary market. Decreases the level of participation by the SBA in the guarantee of general business loans made to qualified small businesses to: (1) 80 percent of the balance of the financing outstanding if such amount is less than or equal to $100,000; and (2) 75 percent of such balance if such amount is greater than $100,000. (Currently, the level is no less than 90 percent of such balance for any amount less than or equal to $155,000.) Limits the maximum authorized interest rate for a loan guaranteed under the Preferred Lenders Program to the highest rate charged for other SBA loan guarantees. Authorizes the SBA to collect from borrowers a loan guarantee fee of: (1) two percent of the outstanding loan balance for loans of less than $250,000; (2)two and a half percent for loans of $250,000 or more, but less than $500,000; and (3) three percent of such balance for loans of $500,000 or greater. (Currently, the SBA may collect a loan fee of two percent for loans of any amount.) Exempts from such fees loans repayable in one year or less. Directs the SBA to collect an additional fee to offset administrative costs of such loans. Repeals a provision authorizing lenders to retain one half of such loan guarantee fee. Amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to: (1) increase to $1.25 million the maximum authorized loan that may be made to each qualifying State and local development company for use in plant acquisition, construction, conversion, and expansion; and (2) direct the SBA to collect an additional fee to offset administrative costs of such loans."
