  <summary>8/2/1995--Introduced.
Retiree Continuation Coverage Act of 1995 - Amends the Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code to extend group health plan insurance continuation coverage under COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985) to retirees and their dependents, in cases of substantial reduction or elimination of a retiree group health plan. Allows early retirees and their dependents who lost such employer-sponsored health benefits to purchase continuing group health insurance coverage until they become eligible for Medicare.</summary>
