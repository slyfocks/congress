Amends title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to provide for findings of presumptive disability under such title in the same manner and to the same extent as are currently applicable under SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income). Amends SSA title XVI to provide that any individual who receives a benefit under SSA title II on the basis of presumptive disability shall be deemed for purposes of SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to be a recipient of a benefit under SSA title XVI in any case in which he or she would be eligible for such benefit under SSA title XVI if the amount of such benefit under SSA title II were disregarded.</summary>
