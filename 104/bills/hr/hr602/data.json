Title II: Authority Modifications Pursuant to Covenant of Northern Mariana Islands - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide minimum wage coverage for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands on the same basis as American Samoa. (Sec. 203) Treats the Northern Mariana Islands as a State for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Applies Federal statutes and regulations governing admission to Guam of certain workers described by such Act to individuals seeking entry into the Northern Mariana Islands for purposes of employment in the textile, hotel, tourist, or construction industries. Requires the Attorney General to limit the amount of immigrant workers in such industries to the number of such workers admitted into the Northern Mariana Islands in 1992. Authorizes an increase in such limit based on the percentage by which the current population exceeds that of the 1992 population. (Sec. 204) Removes the authority of the Northern Mariana Islands to rebate taxes. Title III: Insular Areas Consolidation Act - Insular Areas Consolidation Act of 1995 - Requires the State of Hawaii to include Baker Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Howland Island, the Midway Islands, and Palmyra Atoll. (Sec. 302) Subjects such islands, appurtenant reefs, and territorial waters to existing rights of use, ownership, and operation by the U.S. Government. (Sec. 303) Exempts such reef, islands, and atolls from provisions governing guano islands. (Sec. 305) Makes such consolidation subject to acceptance by the Governor of Hawaii. Title IV: Conveyance of Submerged Lands to Northern Mariana Islands - Makes specified provisions regarding the conveyance of tidelands, submerged lands, and filled lands currently applicable to Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa applicable to the Northern Mariana Islands as well. Title V: Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act - Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act - Sets forth requirements for claims for awards or benefits for compensable injuries suffered by Guamanians during World War II. (Sec. 502) Defines \"compensable injury\" as any of the three following categories of injury incurred during, or as a result of, World War II: (1) death; (2) personal injury; or (3) forced labor, forced march, or internment. (Sec. 503) Requires the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Trust Fund Board of Directors to determine eligibility for awards or benefits and certify claims for payment. (Sec. 504) Makes Guamanians who personally received compensable injuries eligible for awards and heirs or next of kin of such individuals eligible for benefits. Lists additional criteria to be met by claimants. Provides for payment for certified claims. (Sec. 505) Requires payment of the benefit (in cases where the relevant injury was death) to be divided among the heirs or next of kin claiming such payment, as provided in the Guam probate laws. (Sec. 506) Establishes the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Trust Fund and the Trust Fund Board of Directors for making disbursements under this Act. Permits the Board to make disbursements from the Trust Fund only: (1) to make payments of awards and benefits to eligible claimants; (2) to sponsor research and public educational activities relating to Guamanian wartime experiences; (3) to disburse funds as benefits to eligible claimants through a revolving fund for purposes such as post-secondary scholarships and first-time home ownership loans; and (4) for administrative expenses. (Sec. 510) Limits any remuneration on account of services rendered on behalf of any claimant in connection with any claim to five percent of the amount paid on such claim. Prescribes penalties for violations of such limit. (Sec. 512) Authorizes appropriations. Title VI: Delegate from Puerto Rico - Redesignates the Resident Commissioner to the United States from Puerto Rico as the Delegate from Puerto Rico. (Sec. 602) Reduces the term of office of the Delegate from four to two years. Title VII: Consultation of and Efforts to Include Territories Regarding Free Trade Agreements - Requires the President to: (1) consult with representatives chosen by the governors of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands regarding the process advanced by the Miami Summit of the Americas Declaration of Principles that would have an impact on such territories and include such representatives in the U.S. delegation to any working group or task force regarding such process, including the development of the Free Trade of the Americas agreement; (2) provide for the same consultation and inclusion of representatives with respect to American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands regarding the process advanced by the Bogor Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Declaration of Common Resolve that would have any impact on such territories, including the goal of free trade among APEC members. (Sec. 702) Requires the President to grant American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands tariff treatment comparable to that granted to parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or other free trade agreements to which the United States becomes a party. Applies such requirement only if such a territory reaches a tariff staging agreement with the President that phases out tariffs between the territory and the United States in equal annual increments over a period not to exceed ten years. (Sec. 703) Requires, upon completion of such an agreement, that: (1) such territory be included in the U.S. customs territory; and (2) the President take steps necessary to include such territory in NAFTA and all other free trade agreements to which the United States is a party."
