Title IV: Medicare Payment Methodologies - Mandates development of a methodology for making payments under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) for telemedicine services furnished on an emergency basis in a health professional shortage area.

Title V: Hospital Antitrust Fairness - Makes antitrust laws inapplicable to hospital mergers or contracts between hospitals to allocate services if each of the hospitals: (1) is outside of a city, or in a city with less than 150,000 inhabitants; (2) received more than 40 percent of its gross revenue from payments under Federal programs; and (3) the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has issued a certificate specifying that HCFA has determined that the merger or contract would reduce Federal expenditures, not increase consumer costs, and not reduce access to health care services. Title VI: Financing - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a tax on Medicare-covered individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes above specified amounts. (Sec. 602) Declares that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out these programs for FY 1996 or any subsequent fiscal year: (1) the grant program for rural health transition under specified provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987; (2) the program for rural outreach grants and the telemedicine grant program that were, for FY 1995, carried out by the Health Resources and Services Administration with funds under a specified Federal law; (3) the program under specified Public Health Service Act provisions relating to State offices of rural health; and (4) the programs under specified parts of title XII (Trauma Care) of the Public Health Service Act."
