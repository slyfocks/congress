  <summary>2/7/1995--Introduced.
Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of 1995 - Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Amendments of 1986 to repeal a provision which would have terminated an exemption for hiring and retirement plans applicable to State and local fire fighters and law enforcement officers. (This Act thereby preserves such exemption beyond 1993.) Amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to set 55 years as the maximum hiring or minimum retirement age which States and localities may require for fire fighters and law enforcement officers unless there is an age of hiring and retirement in effect under applicable State or local law on March 3, 1983. Directs the Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to conduct a study in order to develop and issue, within four years after this Act's enactment, advisory guidelines for administering and using physical and mental fitness tests to measure the ability and competency of law enforcement officers and fire fighters to perform the requirements of their jobs. Requires opportunity for public comment. Requires the Chairman to propose, within two years after this Act's enactment, advisory standards for wellness programs for law enforcement officers and fire fighters. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
