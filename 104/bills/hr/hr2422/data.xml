TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Medicare Security Commission Title II: Medicare Savings Subtitle A: Savings in Medicare Part A Subtitle B: Savings in Medicare Part B Subtitle C: Savings in Parts A and B Subtitle D: Transfers to Part A Trust Fund Medicare Security Act of 1995 - Title I: Medicare Security Commission - Establishes the Medicare Security Commission to make specific recommendations to the Congress regarding revisions to the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (SSA) and health care financing and coverage generally to assure the continuing viability of the program during 2010 and thereafter when demographic changes are expected to expand Medicare's enrollment significantly. Title II: Medicare Savings - Subtitle A: Savings in Medicare Part A - Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) to make various specified technical payment-related changes with regard to Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) matters involving: (1) update reductions for inpatient hospital services subject to the prospective payment system; (2) payments for ancillary costs of skilled nursing facilities under the physician fee schedule; (3) savings resulting from a temporary freeze on payment increases for skilled nursing facility services; and (4) continued reductions in payments for capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services. Subtitle B: Savings in Medicare Part B - Eliminates under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) formula-driven overpayments for certain outpatient hospital services, radiology services, and diagnostic procedures. Adds another 25 percent for FY 1997 to the reduction in practice expense relative value units for certain services. (Sec. 214) Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a competitive acquisition process for durable medical equipment and clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, with a specified mandatory reduction in payment amounts if such competitive acquisition fails to achieve a ten percent minimum reduction in payment amounts. Subtitle C: Savings in Parts A and B - Amends SSA title XVIII to extend through FY 2002 certain Medicare as secondary payer data match requirements. (Sec. 222) Prohibits the Secretary, in establishing reasonable cost limits for payments for home health services, from taking into account any changes in the costs of such services with respect to cost reporting periods which began on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996 (thus continuing the temporary freeze on payment increases for such services). (Sec. 223) Reduces from 95 percent to 89 percent the Federal share of the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC) payment to Medicare health maintenance organizations. Subtitle D: Transfers to Part A Trust Fund - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, each fiscal year, amounts equivalent to the estimate of what would have been expended during the fiscal year, but for this title, from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.</summary>
