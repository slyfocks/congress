  <summary>8/2/1995--Introduced.
Lobbying Disclosure Reform Act of 1995 - Requires registration with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) by any individual lobbyist (or the individual's employer, if it employs one or more lobbyists) within 30 days after the individual first makes, or is employed or retained to make, a lobbying contact with either the President, the Vice President, a Member of Congress, or any other specified Federal officer or employee. Defines a lobbyist as any individual employed or retained by a client for financial or other compensation for services that include one or more lobbying contacts (but not an individual whose lobbying activities constitute less than ten percent of the time engaged in the services provided to that client). Provides for: (1) special registration filing rules in cases involving multiple clients and contacts; and (2) registration termination in cases where a registrant is no longer employed or retained by a client to conduct lobbying activities, and does not anticipate any additional lobbying activities for such client. Specifies the contents of such registration and reports. Requires registrants to file semiannual lobbying activity reports with the Commission. Provides for exemptions from such registration and reporting requirements in cases involving lobbying income of $2,500 or less (for a particular client), total income in connection with lobbying activities in a six month period of $5,000 or less, or total expenses of $5,000 or less (for all lobbying activities) (adjusted periodically for inflation) for the semiannual period. Specifies various duties of the FEC Chairman for carrying out this Act, including reviewing registrations and reports filed under this Act, and making copies of them available to the public for a fee. Establishes procedures for: (1) determining and resolving alleged violations of this Act; and (2) judicial review of such determinations. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth special rules for the identification of: (1) foreign and other clients on whose behalf lobbying contacts are made with a covered legislative or executive branch official; and (2) such covered officials. Permits tax-exempt charitable organizations required to report lobbying expenses by the Internal Revenue Code to report, under this Act, only good faith estimates of such expenses in order to meet specified criteria for exemption from the reporting requirements of this Act.</summary>
