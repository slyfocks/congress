Requires: (1) audit reporting of whether an agency's financial management systems comply with requirements; (2) compliance determination by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), acting through the Controller of the Office of Federal Financial Management; and (3) if there is noncompliance with the standards, a remediation plan. Sets forth a limitation on the time period for bringing the agency's financial management systems into compliance. Allows the transfer of up to two percent of agency funds for priority financial management system improvements. Requires a report by the Director of OMB if an agency fails to bring its financial management systems into compliance within the specified time period. Directs the: (1) Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, jointly, to study and submit a report to the Congress on how the Congress and the legislative branch may achieve compliance; and (2) Chief Justice of the United States to study and submit a report to the Congress on how the judiciary may achieve compliance. Sets forth: (1) reporting requirements; (2) definitions; and (3) the effective date."
