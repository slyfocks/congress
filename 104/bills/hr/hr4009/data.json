    "date": "1996-08-02", 
    "text": "Hazardous Waste Facilities Public Accountability Act of 1996 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to: (1) prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from authorizing a State hazardous waste program unless the State promulgates standards for the acceptable location of new (or expansion of existing) treatment, storage, and disposal facilities as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment, including standards related to seismic and geological features, ecological resources, proximity to residences and certain public facilities, complex hydrogeology, and groundwater resources; and (2) require the Administrator to promulgate such standards with respect to the State if the State does not do so. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations setting requirements for the payment of permit fees by owners and operators of hazardous waste facilities sufficient to cover reasonable costs of administering the permit program. Prohibits authorization of a State program unless the State demonstrates that it will collect such amounts. Requires regular review of programs for compliance with these requirements and allows the Administrator to collect fees directly from owners and operators in the event the State does not adequately do so. Imposes penalties for fee nonpayment. Prohibits a person from obtaining or renewing a permit for a facility or expanding or transferring the facility unless the person makes certain demonstrations regarding environmental and public health law compliance, payment of outstanding fines or penalties, and the availability to the public of a disclosure statement concerning previous violations of law."
