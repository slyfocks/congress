(Sec. 101) Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that the public be notified before a committee or subcommittee holds a meeting or hearing. (Sec. 102) Amends rule XXI to require a report from any committee accompanying any bill authorizing or providing obligational authority or tax expenditures or the joint explanatory statement accompanying a conference report on such bill to contain a concise statement: (1) describing the effect of any provision of the bill or conference report which changes the application of existing law; and (2) to list in a separate and identifiable part of the report or joint explanatory statement each item in such bill, report, conference report, or joint explanatory statement that earmarks the required use of funds below the appropriation account level or provides a specific tax expenditure. (Sec. 103) Requires: (1) the House Committee on Appropriations to immediately notify the appropriate standing committee whenever the Committee orders reported any general appropriations bill that makes appropriations for any unauthorized expenditure, or that reappropriates unexpended balances of appropriations, within the jurisdiction of any other standing committee; (2) a House committee to notify such Committee whenever it reports any bill, resolution, or amendment thereto, carrying an appropriation from a committee not having jurisdiction to report appropriations; (3) such Committee to deliver copies of appropriation bills as passed the House with numbered Senate amendments to the appropriate authorizing committees at least 24 hours before requesting appointment of conferees thereon unless the Speaker of the House determines otherwise; and (4) the Committee to deliver copies of the conference report and accompanying joint explanatory statement to the appropriate authorizing committees at least 24 hours before floor action thereon unless the Speaker determines otherwise. (Sec. 104) Directs the Speaker and the minority leader of the House to appoint 20 independent factfinders at the beginning of each Congress to carry out investigations on behalf of the House as required by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.

Requires such Committee to adopt specified rules relating to the use of independent factfinders.

(Sec. 107) Expresses the sense of the House that: (1) the three-day layover requirement for committee reports on legislation and on conference reports may not be waived unless the legislation and any accompanying report have been available to each Member for at least 24 hours before its consideration on the House floor; (2) an amendment to a bill to be considered under suspension of the rules should be printed and available to each Member for at least 24 hours before its consideration; (3) committees and conference committees should endeavor to file reports on word processing computer disks to facilitate availability to Members; (4) an internal cable system, a cable channel, or party specific channels should be developed to provide Members with summaries of the pending legislation and should be available in their offices, committee hearing rooms, and the cloakrooms; and (5) the full text of bills, amendments, reports, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimates, General Accounting Office (GAO) reports, Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) reports, Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports and Issue Briefs, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the annotated CFR, the Congressional Record, and the Federal Register should be made available to all Members and congressional staff via computer by the beginning of the 105th Congress and such appropriate legislative information should also be made available to the public and the Depository Libraries through a low-cost computer connection. (Sec. 108) Expresses the sense of the House that specified steps should be taken to improve the public's understanding of the Congress and the legislative process. (Sec. 109) Expresses the sense of the House that the Committee on House Oversight and the House Committee on Appropriations should conduct a study of the salary ranges of congressional personal, committee, and administrative staff with a view toward achieving bicameral salary parity for House and Senate staff performing analogous functions.
