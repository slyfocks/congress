    "text": "Veterans Health Care Reform Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct within the Department of Veterans Affairs a program of reformed health care to: (1) expand the Department's capacity to provide outpatient care to eligible veterans; and (2) allocate resources to enable Department facilities to provide access to health care which is reasonably similar, regardless of the State of residence, to: (a) veterans with a compensable service-connected disability; (b) veterans discharged or released from active duty due to a disability incurred in the line of duty; (c) certain veterans in receipt of veterans' disability compensation; (d) former prisoners of war; (e) veterans of the Mexican border period or World War I; or (f) veterans unable to defray the expenses of necessary care. Directs the Secretary, through September 30, 1999, to manage Department health care facilities so as to provide to such veterans and all other veterans (subject to certain limitations) necessary hospital care and outpatient medical treatment, including preventive health care and prosthetic appliances. Allows home care services to be included. Directs the Secretary to ensure that the Department maintains its capacity to provide for the specialized treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on the Department's experience in establishing and administering the program. Terminates the program at the end of FY 1999. Adds to the authorized uses of health care reimbursement funds recovered by the Department from third party payers the expenses of establishing new outpatient care clinics or altering or remodeling current facilities to provide additional space for such care. Establishes within the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical-Care Cost Recovery Fund a reserve for such purposes. Directs the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on medical care cost recovery."
