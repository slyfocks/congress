    "text": "Financing Corporation and Savings Association Insurance Fund Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer into a trust fund managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) certain funds appropriated (but not yet paid) to the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Instructs the FDIC Board of Directors to invest trust fund proceeds not required to meet the short-term requirements of either the RTC or the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Mandates that: (1) the interest earned on such trust fund investments be paid to meet the obligations of the Financing Corporation; (2) the balance in such trust fund be made available to cover actual or anticipated SAIF losses until its reserve ratio meets or exceeds the applicable designated reserve ratio; (3) the trust fund be abolished and any remaining balance returned to the Treasury after the Financing Corporation has repaid certain obligations; and (4) the assessments paid by SAIF members to the Financing Corporation be treated as insurance outlays for purposes of Federal law. Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to authorize the FDIC to impose a one-time special SAIF capitalization assessment on each SAIF member. Amends the FDIA to repeal the minimum assessments requirements for any deposit insurance fund risk-based assessment system. Limits the average assessment rate differential between former Bank Insurance Fund and SAIF members to a maximum of nine basis points."
