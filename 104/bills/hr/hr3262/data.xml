  <summary>4/17/1996--Introduced.
Common Sense Medicare Antibiotic Coverage Act of 1996 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to expand coverage under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) of certain antibiotics (covered as items of durable medical equipment) parenterally administered in a home setting. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) recommend to the Congress appropriate adjustments to the payment amounts provided for Medicare items and services to take into account the reduced costs to individuals and providers resulting from Medicare part B coverage of such antibiotics; (2) adjust such payment amounts in order to ensure that aggregate Medicare payments in any fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made had not such coverage been enacted; and (3) report to the Congress on any other antibiotics appropriate for coverage.</summary>
