Specifies factors for the court to consider in determining whether a mark is distinctive. Limits owners of such marks to injunctive relief unless the person against whom the injunction is sought willfully intended to trade on the owner's reputation or to cause dilution of the mark. Provides for additional remedies if such intent is proven. Makes ownership by a person of a valid registration under specified Acts or on the principal register a complete bar to an action against such person, with respect to that mark, that is brought under common or State law and that seeks to prevent dilution of the distinctiveness of a mark, label, or form of advertisement. Provides that the following shall not be actionable: (1) fair use of a famous mark in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services; (2) noncommercial use of a mark; and (3) all forms of news reporting and news commentary. Defines \"dilution\" as the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of: (1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties; or (2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception."
