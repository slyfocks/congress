  <summary>3/29/1996--Introduced.
Livable Wage Act - Prohibits Federal executive agencies from entering into any contract which does not require that the wages and benefits paid under that Federal contract (and its subcontracts) be greater than the poverty line for a family of four in the local area. Makes such wage requirement inapplicable to: (1) bona fide job training or apprenticeship programs; or (2) contracts with businesses with 50 or fewer employees.</summary>
