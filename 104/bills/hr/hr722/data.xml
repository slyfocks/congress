Community Development Financial Institutions Fund Securities Guarantee Act of 1995 - Amends the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue guarantees for debt securities issued by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Specifies a $2 billion per fiscal year maximum and 20-year term for such guarantees. Sets forth provisions limiting such guarantees and their costs to the extent such amounts are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Provides that a prohibition under the Act against Fund issuance of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes or other securities shall not apply to its issuance of guaranteed debt instruments. Prohibits the use of proceeds from the issuance of such securities to provide financial assistance, including equity investment, to any community development financial institution with assets of more than $50 million.</summary>
