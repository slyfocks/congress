  <summary>5/9/1995--Introduced.
Veterans' Employment and Training Bill of Rights Act of 1995 - Entitles a veteran to priority of services under any federally-funded work-force preparation, development, or delivery program if the veteran: (1) otherwise meets the eligibility requirements for such program; and (2) enters such program before the end of the ten-year period beginning on the veteran's date of discharge or release from active duty. Requires the entity administering the program to provide appropriate information and referral assistance to veterans. Gives special disabled veterans first priority in such programs. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report annually to specified congressional committees with information ensuring that veterans are being served by such programs and that the services of such programs are in proportion to the number of veterans in the labor market.</summary>
