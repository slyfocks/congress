Requires the entity administering the program to provide appropriate information and referral assistance to veterans. Gives special disabled veterans first priority in such programs. Directs the Secretary of Labor to report annually to specified congressional committees with information ensuring that veterans are being served by such programs and that the services of such programs are in proportion to the number of veterans in the labor market."
