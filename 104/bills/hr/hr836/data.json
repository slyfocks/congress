(Sec. 3) Revises the composition of the Board of Directors for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Repeals the mandate for and authority of a Board of Review of the Airports Authority, thus abolishing it. Prohibits any proposed action of the Board of Directors which could result in a change in the impact of aircraft noise in the vicinity of a Metropolitan Washington Airport unless, at least 60 days before the action is to take effect, it: (1) notifies the Committee on Noise Abatement at National and Dulles Airports of the Washington Council of Governments of the action to allow them an opportunity to review, and submit comments on, such action; and (2) submits to such committee a response to any committee comment with respect to such action. (Sec. 4) Requires persons appointed as members of the Board upon the enactment of this Act to continue to serve until their original terms expire. Provides for the appointment of persons to fill vacancies on the Board."
