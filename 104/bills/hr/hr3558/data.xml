  <summary>5/30/1996--Introduced.
Decennial Census Improvement Act of 1996 - Requires the Bureau of the Census, in conducting the 2000 decennial census, to: (1) attempt to contact every household directly, whether by mail or in person (and allows the use of sampling as a substitute for direct contact in a particular census tract only after direct contact has been made with at least 90 percent of the households in such tract); and (2) seek to make more effective use of State and local government offices and appropriate local groups to reduce the undercount and include in a specified report a description of the measures it intends to carry out such requirement. Modifies Federal law regarding exemptions for reemployed annuitants and former uniformed service members to make such law: (1) applicable to service in any temporary position within the Bureau established for purposes relating to the 2000 decennial census; and (2) inapplicable to any service performed after December 31, 2000. Prohibits taking into account compensation for services performed by an individual appointed to a temporary position in or under the Bureau for purposes relating to the 2000 decennial census (if the position is so designated by the Bureau, in writing, at the time of such individual's appointment) for purposes of: (1) State programs for aid and services to needy families with children and for child- welfare services, and for certain medical assistance, under the Social Security Act; (2) the Food Stamp program; (3) certain programs for housing assistance; (4) specified assistance under the school breakfast and lunch programs, the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, and the Job Training Partnership Act; (5) any Head Start program; and (6) assistance pursuant to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981.</summary>
