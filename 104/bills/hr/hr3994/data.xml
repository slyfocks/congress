Entrepreneur Development Program Act of 1996 - Amends the Small Business Act (the Act) to establish within the Small Business Administration (SBA) an Entrepreneur Development Program to provide comprehensive and structured business development assistance to foster the entrepreneurial development of emerging small businesses owned and controlled by individuals certified as eligible by the SBA. States that a business meets eligibility requirements if its management and daily operations are controlled by one or more eligible individuals, an Indian tribe, or native Hawaiian organization. Makes eligible for such assistance individuals whose net worth is no more than $250,000, excluding the value of such individual's investment in the emerging business. Directs the SBA to develop and administer an outreach program to inform and recruit eligible businesses to apply for the Program. Outlines provisions concerning individual eligibility requirements and application deadlines. Limits the term of participation to five years from the date of certification as an eligible Program participant. Requires each business and participant to submit to the SBA a business plan for such emerging business, with specified contents, and to annually review and update such plan. Requires each participant to annually: (1) certify its continued eligibility; and (2) submit a financial statement. Requires prompt SBA notification of a change in business ownership. Provides a special rule for transfers to small business investment companies. Provides for: (1) eligibility status reviews; and (2) Program participation termination (including graduation from the Program after successful completion of Program goals). Directs the SBA Administrator to develop and implement a process for the systematic collection of data on Program operations, monitoring regularly the effectiveness of the assistance being provided to Program participants. Requires an annual report from the Administrator to the Congress on such effectiveness. Provides conflict-of-interest restrictions between SBA employees and Program participants, with penalties for prohibited actions. (Sec. 3) Amends the Act to repeal provisions relating to procurement contracts, subcontracts to disadvantaged small business concerns, performance bonds, contract negotiations, publication, recruitment, construction subcontracts, and annual estimates. Defines "Indian tribe" and "native Hawaiian organization" for purposes of the Act. Outlines procedures to be followed in the case of a protest against the representation by a business as a small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, including a hearing by the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. Provides for the determination of the size of a business concern owned by an Indian tribe. Prohibits any SBA employee from taking, directing others to take, recommending, or approving any action with respect to any SBA program or activity on the basis of the political activity or affiliation of any party. Provides penalties for such action. (Sec. 4) Requires each executive agency reporting to the Federal Procurement Data System contract actions with an aggregate value in excess of $50 million in FY 1995 or thereafter to prepare a forecast of expected contract opportunities or classes of opportunities for the next and succeeding fiscal years that small business concerns, including those owned and controlled by women or socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, are capable of performing. Requires the periodic revision of such forecast. (Sec. 5) Prohibits a small business concern meeting specified requirements (including that it is a regular dealer primarily engaged in the wholesale or retail trade that will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor) from being denied the opportunity to submit and have considered its offer for any Federal procurement contract for the supply of a product.</summary>
