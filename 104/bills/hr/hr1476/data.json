    "text": "Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund Merger Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to: (1) establish the deposit insurance fund for insured depository institutions; (2) abolish the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF); (3) transfer such Funds' assets and liabilities to the deposit insurance fund; and (4) deposit into such fund all amounts assessed against insured depository institutions. Prescribes guidelines under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) shall keep a full and complete accounting of all costs, expenses, and receipts. Sets forth an assessments schedule for former BIF members capped at rates applicable before the funds' merger. Limits the average assessment rate differential between former BIF and SAIF members to a maximum of nine basis points. Repeals the guidelines pertaining to moratorium on conversion transactions and to exit fees. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to reflect amendments made by this Act regarding payment of Financing Corporation costs by all FDIC-insured depository institutions. Amends the FDIA to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, upon FDIC request, to lend funds to the deposit insurance fund out of funds appropriated to the Resolution Trust Corporation and not expended by it. Authorizes the FDIC to impose a one-time special SAIF capitalization assessment."
