Places a moratorium on the authority of persons to seek contribution from another person who is: (1) potentially liable for hazardous substance releases during or following any civil action; and (2) not a party to a settlement, in cases where such persons have resolved liability to the United States or a State for an environmental response action for some or all of the costs in an approved settlement. Applies such moratorium to judicial actions initiated before this Act's enactment date that are pending as well as those initiated after such date. Provides that limitation periods with regard to the commencement of actions for the recovery of specified costs and damages shall be tolled for the period that a moratorium under this Act is in effect."
