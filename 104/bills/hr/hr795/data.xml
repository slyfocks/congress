  <summary>2/2/1995--Introduced.
Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency from continuing or beginning to conduct administrative or judicial enforcement actions against the following persons under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 if such persons did not directly cause the release or threat of release of the hazardous substance concerned and did not have knowledge of such release: (1) persons who arranged for the disposal, treatment, or transport of hazardous substances by another party at a facility owned by another party; and (2) persons who accepted hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities or sites from which a release occurs which causes the incurrence of response costs. Places a moratorium on the authority of persons to seek contribution from another person who is: (1) potentially liable for hazardous substance releases during or following any civil action; and (2) not a party to a settlement, in cases where such persons have resolved liability to the United States or a State for an environmental response action for some or all of the costs in an approved settlement. Applies such moratorium to judicial actions initiated before this Act's enactment date that are pending as well as those initiated after such date. Provides that limitation periods with regard to the commencement of actions for the recovery of specified costs and damages shall be tolled for the period that a moratorium under this Act is in effect.</summary>
