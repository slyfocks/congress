Prohibits the imposition of tax on compressed natural gas during that period. Reduces, for taxes imposed during that period, the rates regarding: (1) certain aviation fuel; (2) gasoline used in trains and certain buses and diesel fuel used in trains; and (3) alcohol fuels in provisions defining the Highway Trust Fund financing rate. Provides for the treatment of floor stocks. Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) cancel budget authority in current defense procurement accounts as necessary to achieve a reduction of $2.9 billion in Department of Defense outlays; and (2) report to the Congress on the programs, projects, and activities from which cancellations are made."
