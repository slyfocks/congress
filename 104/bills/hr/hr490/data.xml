  <summary>1/11/1995--Introduced.
Farm, Ranch, and Homestead Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior, until the Act's reauthorization, from: (1) determining that a species is an endangered or threatened species; or (2) designating a species habitat as a critical habitat. Requires the Secretary, upon the request of persons or entities other than the Federal Government, to compensate such persons or entities for the loss in market value of land that has been designated a critical habitat. Exempts Federal agencies, until the Act's reauthorization, from complying with specified requirements, including: (1) carrying out programs for the conservation of threatened and endangered species; and (2) insuring that Federal actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction of habitat.</summary>
