Applies the prohibition on infringement of patents to such entitlement. Prohibits submission of an application under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for introduction into interstate commerce of a drug claimed in a patent, or the use of which is claimed in a patent, before the expiration of such entitlement."
