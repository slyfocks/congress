  <summary>5/16/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Trade Act of 1974 to prohibit the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country eligible for trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences if: (1) it transfers to a non-nuclear-weapon state certain nuclear devices, components, or design information for use in the development of a nuclear device; or (2) (as a non-nuclear-weapon state itself) it receives or explodes a nuclear device, or seeks and receives any nuclear weapons component or design information for use in the development of a nuclear device. Makes intent by the state in question to develop a nuclear explosive device an essential element in any determination to apply such prohibition.</summary>
