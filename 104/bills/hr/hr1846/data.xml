  <summary>6/14/1995--Introduced.
Establishes the Yellowstone Headwaters National Recreation Area within the Gallatin and Custer National Forests in Montana. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) administer the Area in accordance with this Act and with the provisions of law generally applicable to national forest system units; (2) develop a management plan for the Area to reflect its establishment and to conform to this Act; and (3) acquire lands or interests in lands within the Area's boundaries that are necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Withdraws such lands from U.S. mining laws, mineral and geothermal leasing laws, and from disposal of mineral materials under the Materials Act of 1947. Prohibits: (1) a patent from being issued after June 14, 1995, for any location or claim made in the Area under U.S. mining laws; (2) Federal lands from being used in connection with any mining or mining-related activity within the Area; and (3) such activities involving any surface disturbance of lands or waters within such Area, except in accordance with requirements imposed by the Secretary. Requires: (1) the Secretary to complete an expedited program to examine all unpatented mining claims within the Area; and (2) if the Secretary of the Interior determines that a claim is invalid, to declare it to be null and void. Prohibits a Federal department or agency from issuing authorizations to persons for mining or mining-related activities within the Area until the Secretary has determined that previous mining related environmental damage that has occurred on lands owned or used by such person or any person who controls, is controlled by, or under common control with, such person has been remediated in accordance with applicable Federal and State requirements. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
