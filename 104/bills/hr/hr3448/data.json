Requires a United States person to report information regarding foreign gifts or bequests when the gifts' aggregate value during a taxable year exceeds $10,000. Modifies requirements regarding the interest charge on accumulation distributions from foreign trusts. Changes the circumstances in which an estate or trust is included in the definition of \"United States person.\" Modifies the definition of \"foreign estate or trust.\" Requires (for provisions relating to the imposition of a tax on transfers to avoid income tax) treating a trust which is not a foreign trust and which becomes a foreign trust as having transferred, immediately before becoming a foreign trust, all of its assets to a foreign trust. Subtitle J: Generalized System of Preferences - GSP Renewal Act of 1996 - Amends the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Authorizes the President to designate a country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for extension of trade preferences under the GSP. Removes Austria, Finland, and Sweden from the list of countries which may not be designated as beneficiary developing countries. (The three countries are now member states of the European Union, which is ineligible for such designation.) Declares that, for purposes of designating a beneficiary developing country, a country may be found to not provide protection of intellectual property rights, notwithstanding the fact that it may be in compliance with the specific obligations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Authorizes the President to withdraw or suspend duty-free treatment for the products of a country based on consideration of specified factors. Requires the President to: (1) withdraw or suspend the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country if it is determined that changed circumstances would bar its designation as a beneficiary developing country; and (2) terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country if during any calendar year the official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development demonstrate that such country has become a \"high income\" country. Requires the President to notify the Congress before designating or terminating a country as a beneficiary developing country. Revises provisions on the designation of articles as eligible for preferential treatment. Authorizes the President to designate additional articles as eligible articles for countries designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries if, after receiving advice from the International Trade Commission, it is determined that such articles are not import-sensitive. Prohibits an article that has been denied designation as an eligible article from being reconsidered for such designation for a three year period. Prohibits, with respect to the President's withdrawing, suspending, or limiting the duty-free treatment of an eligible article, the establishment of a duty rate for such article other than the rate which would apply but for this Act. Requires the President to terminate the duty-free treatment for an article from a beneficiary developing country (except least-developed beneficiary developing countries) whenever it is determined that such country has exported, directly or indirectly, to the United States during any calendar year a quantity of an eligible article: (1) having an appraised value in excess of $75 million (increased by $5 million on January 1 each calendar year after 1995); or (2) equal to or exceeding 50 percent of the appraised value of the total imports of such article into the United States during the calendar year. Authorizes waiver of such competitive need limitation in the national economic interest if any U.S. industry is unlikely to be adversely affected by it. Prohibits any action under this Act from affecting any tariff duty imposed by the Legislature of Puerto Rico under the Tariff Act of 1930 on coffee imported into Puerto Rico. Requires the President to report to the Congress on: (1) the operation of this Act; and (2) the status of internationally recognized worker rights within each beneficiary developing country. Title II: Payment of Wages - Employee Commuting Flexibility Act of 1996 - Amends the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 to provide that an employer does not have to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation to an employee for or on account of such employee's use of employer-owned vehicles for traveling for commuting purposes, if such use is: (1) within the normal commuting area for the employer's business or establishment; and (2) subject to an agreement on the part of the employer and the employee or employee representative. Considers such commuting use, and activities incidental to it, as not part of the employee's principal activities, thus relieving the employer of liability and punishment, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Walsh-Healey Act, and Davis-Bacon Act, for failure to pay such wage or compensation for the time of such use. (Sec. 4) Minimum Wage Increase Act of 1996 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage rate from the current $4.25 per hour to: (1) $4.75 per hour during the year beginning on October 1, 1996; and (2) $5.15 per hour beginning September 1, 1997. (Sec. 5) Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements certain computer professionals who are compensated at a rate of not less than $27.63 per hour. Revises provisions relating to the tip credit for determining the minimum wage for tipped employees. Allows an employer to pay less than the minimum wage (as increased by this Act, but not less than $4.25 per hour) to any employee who is less than 20 years old, during the first 90 consecutive calendar days after such employee is hired."
