Requires the Medicare Prospective Payment Review Commission, during the first three years in which payments are made under this Act, to report annually to the Congress on the effectiveness of the payment methodology established. Amends SSA title XI to require review by peer review organizations of home health services provided under Medicare. Eliminates certain fiscal intermediary responsibilities under Medicare with regard to home health services. Amends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 to provide for a retroactive reinstatement of presumptive waiver of liability."
