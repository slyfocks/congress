  <summary>11/9/1995--Passed Senate amended.
Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of December 1, 1995, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled adult children, dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) for surviving spouses and children, and additional DIC for surviving spouses with minor children. Requires each such increase to be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date. Requires resulting amounts that are not even multiples of $1 to be rounded to the next lower whole dollar. Requires the Secretary to publish such increases in the Federal Register at the same time that the social security increases are required to be published.</summary>
