  <summary>6/28/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that for purposes of determining estate tax the value of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an amount equal to the value of any qualified historic property. Defines qualified historic property as any certified historic structure and any other real property necessary for public view and visitation that is held by a qualified charitable or governmental organization and is covered by an agreement which, among other things, provides that the historic property will be open to the public for a period of at least 20 years and has a reasonable admission fee.</summary>
