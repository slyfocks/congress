    "text": "International Population Stabilization and Reproductive Health Act - Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to set forth population assistance authorities and requirements. (Sec. 2) Makes such assistance available to a country that: (1) accounts for a significant portion of the world's annual population increment; (2) has significant unmet needs for fertility regulation and requires foreign assistance to sustain quality family planning services; or (3) demonstrates a strong policy commitment to population stabilization through the expansion of reproductive choice. Prohibits nongovernmental and multilateral organizations from being subjected to requirements which are more restrictive than those applicable to foreign governments for such assistance. Makes funds available for: (1) the United Nations Population Fund if it agrees to prohibit the use of funds for coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization; and (2) the Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training to further international cooperation in the development of fertility regulation technology. (Sec. 3) Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 4) Declares the sense of the Congress that the multilateral development banks should increase their annual support for specified population activities to at least $1 billion by December 31, 2000. Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to report annually to the Congress on: (1) resources made available by multilateral development banks for population activities; (2) any specified actions taken by such banks to encourage increased resources if such resources total less than $1 billion; and (3) the progress made by such banks in meeting the objectives of the population activities. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on preparations for U.S. participation in the 1995 World Conference on Women. (Sec. 6) Makes development assistance available on a priority basis for countries which have agreed to address specific education, literacy, and health issues. Authorizes the President to establish a grant program, to be known as the Safe Motherhood Initiative, to improve the access of girls and women to reproductive health care services. Earmarks amounts of development and economic assistance for programs in support of increasing primary and secondary school enrollment and equalizing levels of male and female enrollment. Authorizes appropriations for the Child Survival Fund, the Safe Motherhood Initiative, and for research on, and treatment and control of, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in developing countries. (Sec. 8) Provides for certain actions to support the United Nations Forward Looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women."
