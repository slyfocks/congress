  <summary>11/16/1995--Introduced.
Lake Gaston Protection Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to prohibit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from granting a license, license amendment, or permit (license) for an activity that will result directly or indirectly in the withdrawal by a State or political subdivision of water from a lake, reservoir, or similar body of water (lake) that is situated in two States unless the Governor of the State in which more than half of the lake is situated certifies that the withdrawal will not adversely affect the environment in, or the economy of, that State. Makes an exception regarding an application for a license for an activity that will occur or affect waters located within a river basin that is subject to an interstate compact, a decree of the Supreme Court, or an Act of Congress that specifically allocates the rights to use such water. Specifies that this Act shall apply to any application made on or after January 1, 1991, unless the application has been granted and is no longer subject to judicial review.</summary>
