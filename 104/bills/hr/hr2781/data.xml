Rescinds $440 million of the funds available for small reclamation project loans under the Small Reclamation Projects Act. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in order to encourage State, local, and private participation in the development of reclamation projects, to provide loan guarantees to the developers of water supply, water conservation, water quality, and water transmission projects. Limits the amount of such loans only to the amount authorized by the Congress for such purposes. Exempts such guaranteed loans from U.S. Government budget totals. Pledges the full faith and credit of the United States to all guarantees issued under this Act. Limits to $500 million the maximum contingent liability outstanding at any time pursuant to such guarantees. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
