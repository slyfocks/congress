Medicare Cancer Clinical Trial Program Coverage Act of 1996 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration project which provides for payment under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act of routine patient care costs for Medicare beneficiaries with cancer who are enrolled in an approved clinical trial program, while still applying the beneficiary cost sharing provisions of such program to project participants. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the impact on Medicare of covering such routine patient care costs if coverage were extended to Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis other than cancer.</summary>
