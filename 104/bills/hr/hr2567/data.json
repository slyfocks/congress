Provides that if a State adopts or reviews water quality standards for such conveyances, it shall not be required to establish recreational, aquatic life, or fish consumption uses for such systems if such uses: (1) are not existing or reasonably foreseeable; or (2) interfere with the intended purpose of the system."
