Requires the certification to: (1) be made to the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as applicable; and (2) include a specification of any absence of the Member on a day during which any vote is taken in the House involved, together with the reason for such absence. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) publication of the certification; and (2) criminal penalties for Members of Congress who make false statements in such certification. Prohibits payment of a Member for a day on which he or she is absent and during which any vote is taken in the House involved, unless the absence was for personal illness, family illness, or congressional business. Allows citizens to bring civil actions in district court against the Secretary or the Chief Administrative Officer for injunctive relief in the case of any payment in violation of this Act."
