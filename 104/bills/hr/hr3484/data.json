    "text": "FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Reform Act of 1996 - Amends Federal transportation law to: (1) authorize appropriations for FY 1997 for specified aviation programs; and (2) instruct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to consider the advice of a certain research advisory committee in establishing research and development priorities. Earmarks the research and development appropriations authorized for the support of all FAA research and development activities falling within the categories of basic and applied research and development, including the design and development of prototypes in accordance with specified classifications. Mandates that: (1) the President's annual FAA budget request include all research and development activities within a single budget category; and (2) all FAA activities within the categories of basic and applied research and development be placed within such category. Directs the research advisory committee in the FAA to review annually the Administrator's appropriation allocation among major research and development activities, and give advice and recommendations on whether such allocation is appropriate to meet certain needs and objectives. Amends the guidelines for the national aviation research plan with respect to the goals, priorities, and resources of research and development activities. Directs the FAA to develop, implement, and maintain a disciplined acquisition management system, based on specified operational principles. Authorizes the FAA to implement its own proposed acquisition management system which the Congress recognizes as substantially compatible with such principles."
