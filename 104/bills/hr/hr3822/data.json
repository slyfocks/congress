Subjects such agreement to specified assumptions of project responsibilities and liabilities by the State of Texas or the transferee. Finds that the assumption of Federal nonreimbursable responsibility by Texas and the transferee of the Project is in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, thereby obviating project purchase review."
