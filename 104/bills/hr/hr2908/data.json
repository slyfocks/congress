Authorizes the Secretary to use specified authorities to regulate the production, transportation, and exportation of such stock in order to prevent the introduction or dissemination in interstate commerce and international trade of any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease associated with it and to promote its exportation. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish an advisory committee to advise the Secretary regarding the development and implementation of the program; and (2) certify to any person the health status of any domesticated salmonid seedstock intended for export from the United States. Grants the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce sole responsibility for the health of salmonids and the products thereof located in any facility administered by the Departments of the Interior or Commerce."
