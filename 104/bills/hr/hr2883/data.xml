  <summary>1/25/1996--Introduced.
Family Farm and Home Protection Act - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to revise a State's authority to recover from an individual's estate the cost of medical assistance properly made on his or her behalf in specified circumstances. Repeals the mandate to recover such costs. Eliminates specific recovery authority with respect to certain individuals receiving or entitled to receive benefits under a long-term care insurance policy. Increases from 55 to 65 the minimum age of Medicaid recipients from whose estates the State may recover. Repeals the inclusion in the "estate" of a deceased individual real and personal property which passed to heirs upon the individual's death. Prohibits payment of Federal funds to a State under a State medical assistance program unless express conditions are met concerning the imposition of liens against the property of individuals receiving such assistance through the State program. Provides for the dissolution of any liens imposed upon an individual's discharge from the medical institution and return home. Prohibits any adjustment or recovery of medical assistance correctly paid on behalf or an individual under a State program, except: (1) in the case of certain institutionalized individuals, from their estate or property, subject to a lien properly imposed; and (2) in the case of recipients 65 or older, from their estate. Provides additional limitations on adjustment or recovery until after the individual's surviving spouse dies and no surviving children or siblings lawfully reside in the individual's home.</summary>
