(Sec. 4) Revises the seven-year residency defense against a deportation or exclusion order to permit deportation or exclusion of a permanent resident alien who has been sentenced (currently imprisoned) to five or more years for an aggravated felony. (Sec. 5) Limits collateral attacks on deportation orders. (Sec. 6) Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to: (1) rename the criminal alien tracking center as the criminal alien identification system; (2) specify that the system shall be used to identify and locate deportable aliens who have committed aggravated felonies; and (3) transfer the system from the Attorney General to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (Sec. 7) Amends Federal criminal law to: (1) bring certain alien smuggling-related crimes under the purview of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) provisions; and (2) authorize wiretaps for alien smuggling investigations. (Sec. 9) Amends the Act to expand the criteria for deportation for crimes of moral turpitude. (Sec. 10) Makes local governments eligible for specified alien incarceration reimbursement assistance under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. (Sec. 11) Amends the Act to permit the use of electronic and telephonic media in deportation hearings. (Sec. 13) Directs the Secretary of State and the Attorney General to report on the effectiveness of the Prisoners Transfer Treaty with Mexico. (Sec. 14) Directs the Attorney General to designate a Department of Justice office which shall provide States and local entities with technical and prosecutorial assistance with respect to aliens who flee prosecution for crimes committed in the United States. (Sec. 15) States that the Congress advises the President to negotiate bilateral prisoner transfer treaties. Requires annual presidential certification that a treaty is effectively returning illegal aliens incarcerated in the United States to finish their prison term in their home country. (Sec. 16) Directs the Attorney General and the Commissioner to develop an interior (home country) repatriation program. (Sec. 17) Amends the Act to authorize deportation of nonviolent offenders prior to Federal or State sentence completion."
