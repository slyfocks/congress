TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Intelligence Activities Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System Title III: General Provisions Title IV: Central Intelligence Agency Title V: Department of Defense Intelligence Activities Title VI: Federal Bureau of Investigation Title VII: Technical Amendments Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 - Title I: Intelligence Activities - Authorizes appropriations for FY 1996 for the conduct of the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the: (1) Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); (2) Department of Defense (DOD); (3) Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA); (4) National Security Agency (NSA); (5) Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (6) Departments of State, the Treasury, and Energy; (7) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); (8) Drug Enforcement Administration; (9) National Reconnaissance Office; and (10) Central Imagery Office. (Sec. 102) Specifies that the amounts authorized to be appropriated and the authorized personnel ceilings as of September 30, 1996, for such activities are those specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations for the Conference Report for this bill, which shall be made available to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees and the President. (Sec. 103) Allows the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, to authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY 1996 when the DCI determines that such action is necessary to the performance of important intelligence functions. Requires notification to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees (intelligence committees) when such authority is exercised. (Sec. 104) Authorizes appropriations for the Community Management Account of the DCI for FY 1996, with authorized personnel levels for such staff for such fiscal year. Provides for the reimbursement of any U.S. officer or employee, or member of the armed forces, who is detailed to such Staff. Title II: Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System - Authorizes a specified sum for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund for FY 1996. Title III: General Provisions - Permits appropriations authorized by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for Federal employees to be increased by such additional amounts as may be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Specifies that the authorization of appropriations by this Act shall not be deemed to constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity which is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (Sec. 303) Amends the National Security Act of 1947 to authorize the President to delay the imposition of a sanction related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, or advanced conventional weapons when he determines and reports to the Congress that to proceed without such delay would seriously risk the compromise of an ongoing criminal investigation directly related to the activities giving rise to the sanction or an intelligence source or method directly related to such activities. Limits such a stay to 120 days unless such risk has not been obviated within such time, in which case an additional stay of 120 days will be permitted. Directs the President to promptly submit such required reports. (Sec. 304) Forfeits contributions made by the Federal Government to the Thrift Savings Plan under the Federal Employees Retirement System on behalf of a Federal employee, as well as any earnings from such contributions, if the annuity of such employee, or that of any survivor or beneficiary, is forfeited due to conviction for certain crimes against the United States. (Sec. 305) Makes the spouse of a Federal employee whose annuity or retired pay has been forfeited due to conviction for certain national security offenses eligible for spousal benefits if the Attorney General determines that such spouse fully cooperated with the Federal authorities in the investigation and prosecution which resulted in the forfeiture. (Sec. 306) Allows a nondisclosure policy or agreement executed by a person connected with the conduct of an intelligence activity, other than a Federal employee or officer, to contain provisions appropriate to the particular activity for which such document is to be used. Provides minimum requirements for such agreements concerning authorized disclosure and nondisclosure. (Sec. 307) Directs the DCI to use no more than $25 million of amounts authorized under this Act for activities related to the automatic declassification of CIA records over 25 years old. Requires the President to submit annual budget requests, beginning with FY 1997, for funds to be used for such activities. (Sec. 308) Amends the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 to include employees of specified Federal agencies who are currently prohibited from engaging in certain political action under a Federal provision which authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to permit such activities under specified circumstances.
