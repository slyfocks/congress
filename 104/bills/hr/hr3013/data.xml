Subtitle G: Limitations on Balance Billing - Amends provisions of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act relating to payment for physicians' services to reduce the limiting charge from 115 percent to 105 percent of the recognized payment amount.

Requires the provider to accept payments by the insurer under the terms of the plan as payment in full.

Prohibits treating obligations issued by a health care provider as failing to be qualified section 501(c)(3) bonds solely because the provider is so affiliated if the provider meets specified requirements.</summary>
