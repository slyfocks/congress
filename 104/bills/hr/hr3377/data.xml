  <summary>5/1/1996--Introduced.
Rural Right-of-Way Fairness Act - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to revise the standard for determining liability of holders of rights-of-way to require any regulation or stipulation imposing liability for damage or injury to be determined by ordinary rules of negligence. (Current law requires any regulation or stipulation imposing liability without fault to include a maximum limitation on damages commensurate with the foreseeable risks of hazards presented and any liability for damage or injury in excess of such amount to be determined by ordinary rules of negligence.) Allows rights-of-way to be granted, issued, or renewed, without rental fees, for electric or telephone facilities eligible for financing pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (REA), determined without regard to any application requirement under REA. (Current law requires the facilities to be financed pursuant to REA before being exempted from such fees.)</summary>
