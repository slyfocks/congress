Prohibits organizations from: (1) discriminating against a health physician or nonphysician health professional based solely on their certification or license, in participation in providing covered health services or reimbursement or indemnification for providing such services, if they may legally provide them in accordance with State law; or (2) excluding a nonphysician health professional from participation in its provider network based solely on the professional's certification or license or lack of affiliation with, or admitting privileges at, a hospital, if such lack of affiliation is due to the professional's type of license."
