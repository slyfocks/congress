Requires the segment to be: (1) administered as a recreational river by the Secretary of the Interior through cooperative agreements between the Secretary and the State of New Hampshire and the towns of Durham, Lee, and Newmarket, New Hampshire; and (2) managed in accordance with the Lamprey River Management Plan. Deems the Plan to satisfy the requirement for a comprehensive management plan pursuant to the Act. Requires the Secretary to coordinate the Secretary's management responsibilities under this Act with the Lamprey River Advisory Committee. Deems the zoning ordinances adopted by such towns, including provisions for conservation of shorelands, floodplains, and wetlands associated with the segment, to satisfy the standards and requirements of the Act. Applies to the segment provisions of the Act which prohibit Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation. Provides that the acquisition of lands for purposes of this Act shall be limited to donation or acquisition with the owner's consent and shall be subject to the additional criteria set forth in the Plan. Requires the Secretary to offer assistance regarding continued involvement of the town of Epping, New Hampshire, in the implementation of the Plan and in consideration of potential future addition of that portion of the River within Epping as a component of the System. Authorizes appropriations."
