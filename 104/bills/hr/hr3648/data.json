Authorizes the Secretary of Education to carry out a program of awarding scholarships to students for the study of the physical, life, or computer sciences, mathematics, or engineering. Deems students awarded such scholarships National Science Scholars. Sets forth the selection of scholars for initial awards and eligibility requirements for initial and continuation awards and directs the Secretary to notify all public and private secondary schools and all higher education institutions in each State annually of the availability of scholarships. Limits the amount of a scholarship awarded for any academic year to $5,000. Requires that students receiving scholarships shall be given priority consideration for federally financed summer employment in federally funded research and development centers that, to the maximum extent practicable, complements and reinforces the educational program of these students."
