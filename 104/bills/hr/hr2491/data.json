Requires contracts to be entered into by April 15, 1996, with certain exceptions for conservation reserve lands. Defines eligible \"owners and operators\" and \"farmland.\" Sets forth: (1) contract payment amounts for each of FY 1996 through 2002 and allocation amounts for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, and rice; and (2) annual payment rate factors.

Provides that: (1) net gains from each marketing pool shall be distributed only to pool producers; and (2) losses in quota pools shall be covered using a specified order of priority. Prohibits the Secretary from making quota peanut loans if producers have disapproved poundage quotas. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 with regard to the peanut program to: (1) extend peanut quota provisions through crop year 2002; (2) eliminate the minimum national poundage quota; (3) eliminate seed peanuts from the national poundage quota determination; (4) create a temporary quota allocation for seed peanuts; (5) eliminate the Texas increased quota allocation; and (6) authorize transfers of additional peanuts to the quota pool where natural disasters prevented quota poundage harvesting and marketing. (Sec. 1107) Directs the Secretary to make recourse loans available to processors of domestically grown sugarcane and sugar beets at 18 cents per pound and 22.9 cents per pound, respectively. Sets loan terms at the earlier of nine months or the end of the fiscal year, with supplemental loans available for loans made in the last three months of a fiscal year. Authorizes the Secretary to provide nonrecourse loans when the imported tariff rate quota for sugar imports exceeds 1.5 million short tons raw value. Sets forth first processor sugarcane and sugar beet marketing assessment rates for FY 1996 through 2003, which shall be collected monthly and remitted to the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Sets forth enforcement and reporting provisions. Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to repeal marketing allotment provisions. Makes this section applicable to the 1996 through 2002 crops of sugarcane and sugar beets. (Sec. 1108) Directs the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this subtitle through the CCC. (Sec. 1109) Repeals the Agricultural Act of 1949, with specified sections transferred to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. (Eliminates permanent price support authority.) Makes conforming amendments to the Agricultural Act of 1938. Subtitle B: Conservation - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to provide mandatory FY 1996 through 2002 funding through the CCC for the conservation reserve and wetlands programs, and the livestock environmental assistance program. Establishes the livestock environmental assistance program to provide FY 1996 through 2002 technical assistance and cost-sharing and incentive payments to livestock producers who enter into land management and structural contracts to protect water, soil, and related resources from livestock-related degradation. (Makes waste management facility construction ineligible for cost-sharing payments.) Replaces wetlands reserve program permanent easement authority with 15-year easement authority. Limits conservation reserve program total acreage enrollment to 36.4 million acres. Authorizes producers to terminate program participation. Prohibits new acreage enrollment in 1997. Subtitle C: Agricultural Promotion and Export Programs - Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to: (1) authorize specified FY 1996 through 2002 appropriations for the market promotion program; and (2) authorize specified FY 1996 through 2002 funding from the CCC for the export enhancement program. Subtitle D: Miscellaneous - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to authorize the Secretary, in consultation with insurance providers, to offer catastrophic risk protection in a State (or portion of a State) through local Department of Agriculture offices if the Secretary determines insufficient coverage is otherwise available. Provides for the transfer of current policies to private insurers. States that beginning with the spring-planted 1996 crop catastrophic coverage shall not be required for agricultural program benefits if the producer signs a written emergency crop loss assistance waiver. Extends crop insurance provisions to seed crops. (Sec. 1402) Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to authorize the Secretary to collect fees to cover the costs of providing import quarantine and inspection services. Establishes in the Treasury the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection User Fee Account. (Sec. 1403) Increases the CCC interest rate applicable to agricultural commodity loans by 100 basis points. Title II: Banking, Housing, and Related Provisions - Subtitle A: Financial Institutions - Directs the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to impose a special assessment on the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF)-assessable deposits of each insured depository institution at a rate applicable to all such institutions that the Board, in its sole discretion, determines will cause the SAIF to achieve the designated reserve ratio on the first business day of January 1996. Allows the Board to exempt weak institutions from such assessment. Mandates exemption from such assessment for certain newly chartered and other specified institutions, but requires such institutions to pay semiannual assessments at certain former rates during calendar years 1996 through 1999. (Sec. 2011) Authorizes certain institutions facing hardship as a result of the special assessment to elect to pay it in two assessments, plus a third supplemental special assessment, determined according to specified formulae. Prescribes adjustments of the special assessment for Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) member banks and certain savings associations. (Sec. 2012) Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to revise the assessment authority of the Financing Corporation (FICO), extending FICO assessments to all depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) instead of SAIF members only. Repeals specified limits on the amount that may be assessed. (Sec. 2013) Declares that the SAIF and the BIF shall be merged into the Deposit Insurance Fund, which shall have a Special Reserve for any excess of the SAIF reserve ratio over the designated reserve ratio. Makes conforming amendments to FHLBA and FDIA. (Sec. 2015) Prescribes procedural guidelines with respect to the refund of assessed payments in a deposit insurance fund in excess of the designated reserve amount. (Sec. 2016) Amends the FDIA to declare that assessment rates for SAIF members may not be less than assessment rates for BIF members. (Sec. 2017) Prohibits the FDIC Board of Directors from setting semi-annual assessments in excess of the amount needed to maintain or achieve the designated reserve ratio of a deposit insurance fund. (Sec. 2018) Terminates as of December 31, 1995, the authority of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board to establish positions for and pay compensation and benefits to officers and employees, except for 18 individuals to carry out Board functions through May 1, 1996. Subtitle B: Housing - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with regard to section 8 public housing annual rent adjustments to: (1) limit overall adjustments to a project's cost of operations; and (2) reduce adjustments for units with no turnover since the preceding adjustment. (Sec. 2052) Amends the National Housing Act to revise the Federal Housing Administration mortgage assignment program, including authorizing the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to pay partial mortgage insurance claims limited to an amount equal to not more than 12 months' payments. Title III: Communications and Spectrum Allocation Provisions - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to state that certain competitive bidding requirements shall not apply to licenses or construction permits issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC): (1) that, as the result of the FCC carrying out specified obligations, are not mutually exclusive; (2) for public safety radio services, including non-Federal Government uses that protect the safety of life, health, and property and that are not made commercially available to the public; or (3) for initial licenses or construction permits for new terrestrial broadcast digital television (TV) services assigned by the FCC to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace their current TV licenses, unless specified conditions are met. Prohibits the FCC from assigning initial licenses or construction permits to terrestrial commercial TV broadcast licensees to replace their existing broadcast licenses before November 15, 1996, except as provided pursuant to this Act. Extends through FY 2002 the authority of the FCC to grant such licenses or permits. Requires the FCC to complete all actions necessary to permit the assignment, by September 30, 2002, by competitive bidding of licenses for the use of bands of frequencies that: (1) individually span not less than 25 megahertz (mhz.), unless a combination of smaller bands can reasonably be expected to product greater receipts; (2) in the aggregate span not less than 100 mhz.; (3) are located below three gigahertz (ghz.); and (4) as of this Act's enactment date, have not been designated by FCC regulation for assignment, identified by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to provisions of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (NTIAO), or reserved for Government use pursuant to the Act. Directs the FCC to conduct competitive bidding for not less than one-half of such aggregate spectrum by September 30, 2000. Requires the FCC, in making available bands of frequencies for competitive bidding, to: (1) seek to promote the most efficient use of the spectrum; (2) take into account the cost to incumbent licensees of relocating existing uses to other bands of frequencies or other means of communication and the needs of public safety radio services; (3) comply with the requirements of international agreements concerning spectrum allocations; and (4) take into account the costs to satellite service providers that could result from multiple auctions of like spectrum internationally for global satellite systems. Directs the FCC to notify the Secretary if the FCC: (1) is unable to provide for the effective relocation of incumbent licensees to bands of frequencies that are available to the FCC for assignment; and (2) has identified bands of frequencies that are suitable for the relocation of such licensees and that are allocated for Government use but that could be reallocated pursuant to the NTIAO Act. Amends the NTIAO Act to require the Secretary, upon receiving a notice from the FCC pursuant to this Act, to prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation for use other than by Government stations bands of frequencies that are suitable for the uses identified in the FCC's notice. Authorizes any Federal entity which operates a Government station to accept payment in advance, in-kind reimbursement of costs, or a combination thereof from any person to defray entirely the expenses of relocating the Federal entity's operations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to another. Directs that any such payment be deposited in the account of such Federal entity in the Treasury.
