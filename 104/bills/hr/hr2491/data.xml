Deems such uranium hexafluoride to be of Russian origin. Requires the Secretary to sell, and receive payment for, the transferred uranium hexafluoride: (1) for overfeeding in the operations of enrichment facilities in the United States; (2) for end use outside the United States; (3) in 1995 and 1996 to the Russian Executive Agent at the purchase price for use in matched sales under the Suspension Agreement; or (4) for consumption by end users in the United States during calendar year 2001, according to a specified schedule beginning in 1998. Requires the U.S. Executive Agent, upon request of the Russian Executive Agent, to deliver concurrently to such Agent, an amount of uranium hexafluoride equivalent to the natural uranium component of such low-enriched uranium. Provides for auction of such uranium hexafluoride, or U308 (in the event that the conversion component of such hexafluoride has previously been sold), if the Russian Executive Agent does not exercise its right to agree to take delivery of the natural uranium component of any low-enriched uranium within 90 days after delivery of such low-enriched uranium to the U.S. Executive Agent. Grants the Secretary of Commerce responsibility for administration and enforcement of the limitations set forth in this section.

(Sec. 5216) Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to: (1) repeal the mandate and authority of USEC as of the privatization date; and (2) exclude from the definition of "production facility" the construction and operation of a uranium enrichment facility using AVLIS technology, and make such a facility eligible for one-step licensing. Prohibits issuance of any license or certificate of compliance to USEC or its successor if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) determines that the Corporation is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government, or issuance of a license or certificate of compliance would be inimical to: (1) the common defense and security of the United States; or (2) maintenance of a reliable and economical domestic source of enrichment services. Provides for periodic application of USEC for NRC certification at least once every five years (instead of annually). Revises the purview of judicial review of NRC actions to include: (1) any final order establishing standards to govern DOE gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment facilities, including facilities leased to a corporation established under this Act; and (2) any final determination relating to whether such facilities comply with such standards. Provides for civil money penalties for violations of licensing or certification requirements. (Sec. 5221) Instructs the Secretary to conduct an asset management and disposition program that will result in specified minimum receipts and savings by October 1, 2000, and that will include itemized tons of fuel, chemicals and industrial gases, scrap metal, radiation sources, 17,000 pieces of major equipment, and precious metals and base metals. Exempts such asset disposition from the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act (thus shielding the disposition of Federal assets from established guidelines). (Sec. 5222) Instructs the Secretary to draw down and sell 32 million barrels of oil from the Weeks Island (Louisiana) Strategic Petroleum Reserve Facility in spite of the statutory prohibition against such sale unless the President has made specified state-of- emergency findings.

(Sec. 5333) Amends the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 to repeal its proscription against oil and gas production, leases, or development from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Declares that the Congress determines that such leasing program is compatible with the purposes for which the Refuge was established, and that no further findings or decisions are required to implement this directive (thereby avoiding statutorily-mandated environmental determinations). Declares this subtitle the sole authority for coastal plain leasing. Considers such coastal plain "Federal land" for purposes of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Authorizes the Secretary to designate a specified maximum acreage as Special Areas closed to leasing if the Secretary determines that such Areas are of such unique character as to require special management and regulatory protection. Authorizes the leasing of those Areas, however, by setting lease terms that limit surface use and occupancy but permit the use of horizontal drilling technology from sites on leases located outside the designated Special Areas. Declares that the Secretary's sole authority to close lands within the Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing and to exploration, development and production is that set forth in this subtitle.

(Sec. 5337) Authorizes the Secretary to grant to the highest responsible qualified bidder by sealed competitive cash bonus bid any lands to be leased on the coastal plain upon payment by the lessee of such bonus as may be accepted by the Secretary and of a royalty of at least 12 1/2 percent in amount or value of lease production. Requires the Secretary's approval for subsequent transfers. Sets forth lease terms and conditions, including bonding requirements and mandatory access by the Secretary to all lease data and information. (Sec. 5341) Mandates a 90-day timetable for expedited judicial review of actions challenged under this Act. (Sec. 5342) Instructs the Secretary to issue regulations granting rights-of-way and easements for oil and gas transportation across the coastal plain in accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Provides for periodic on-site inspections of coastal plain facilities that are subject to environmental or safety regulations. (Sec. 5344) Mandates distribution to the State of Alaska of all Federal revenues from competitive bids, sales, bonuses, royalties, rents, fees, or interest derived from coastal plain oil and gas leases. Allocates certain deposits from such revenues to the National Park and Wildlife Refuge Renewal Fund. Establishes the Community Assistance Fund (composed of a specified portion of revenues derived from the Federal share of the first lease sale authorized by this subtitle) to assist organized boroughs and recognized Indian Reorganization Act entities which are directly impacted by oil and gas exploration and production activities to provide public and social services and facilities required in connection with such activities. (Sec. 5351) Amends the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to provide that any person or district holding a repayment or water service contract with the United States may prepay the construction costs either through accelerated or lump sum payments.

(Sec. 5355) Collbran Project Unit Conveyance Act - Prescribes guidelines under which the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to the Ute Water Conservancy District and the Collbran Conservancy District by quitclaim deed in the last quarter of FY 2000, all Federal right, title and interest to the Collbran Reclamation Project.
