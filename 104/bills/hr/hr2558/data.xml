  <summary>10/30/1995--Introduced.
National Driver Register Amendments of 1995 - Amends Federal transportation law to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to enter into an agreement with an organization representing the interests of the States to transfer to it the operation of the National Driver Register's computer timeshare and user assistance functions. Conditions such transfer upon a determination that all States are participating in the National Driver Register's acts as an agent or attorney for or otherwise represents or advises, for compensation, "Problem Driver Pointer System" (which effects the exchange of motor vehicle driving records). Authorizes the head of a Federal agency that issues motor vehicle operator's licenses to request the chief driver licensing official of a State to obtain information about an applicant's motor vehicle driving record. Requires such agency to report to the Secretary on any individual whose operator's license has been denied, revoked, suspended, or canceled, or who has been convicted of a motor vehicle- related offense. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
