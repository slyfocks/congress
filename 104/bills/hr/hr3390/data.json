Amends such Acts to provide for termination of tenancy for criminal activity or activity that threatens the safety or peaceful enjoyment of others. Amends the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to make adult (and juvenile if permitted by State, local, or tribal authority) applicant and tenant criminal records available to owners of federally assisted housing under specified circumstances."
