Prohibits the Secretary from conducting any: (1) oil or gas development activity under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in a specified part of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area; or (2) preleasing activity or lease sale in the three above-mentioned Planning Areas for a specified period. Mandates specified assessments and studies of the Areas addressed by this Act. Establishes the Joint Federal-State Outer Continental Shelf Task Force to request additional studies and surveys as needed to minimize the uncertainty about the effects of preleasing, leasing, and exploration activities. Subjects the first exploration plan submitted after the date of enactment of this Act to the requirements of detailed environmental impact statements. Authorizes appropriations."
