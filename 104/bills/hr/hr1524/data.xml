  <summary>4/7/1995--Introduced.
Tire Recycling Incentives Act - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require tire producers or importers to recycle an amount of scrap tires equal to at least the amount determined by multiplying the amount of tires produced or imported that year by the recycling percentage established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Authorizes compliance by: (1) recycling scrap tires through reintroducing the recovered rubber into a manufacturing process to produce new tires or retread old tire casings; or (2) purchasing recycling credits. Directs the Administrator to establish a recycling percentage and provides for annual increases in such percentage. Requires the Administrator to allow recyclers to create credits for tire recycling and tire producers or importers to purchase such credits. Directs the Attorney General to report to the Congress on the effects of the credit system on competition within the tire and scrap tire recycling industries. Considers a scrap tire recycling or disposal facility to be a solid waste disposal facility for purposes of Internal Revenue Code provisions concerning exempt facility bonds. Directs the Administrator to: (1) publish minimum requirements for State scrap tire management and procedures to be incorporated into State solid waste management plans; (2) provide for expedited review of State plans which include scrap tire recycling measures; and (3) establish standards to minimize health and environmental damages from the improper disposal and storage of tires. Directs the Administrator to publish guidelines for States for the issuance of permits to scrap tire collection facilities and for facility emergency plans. Requires all regulated facilities to have appropriate financial responsibility or insurance. Exempts specified persons from permitting requirements. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to implement a plan to remediate tire piles. Directs the Administrator to develop a guideline for Federal procurement of items that make use of scrap or used tires. Directs the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, to publish standards for Federal departments to determine the life-cycle costs and benefits of items that make use of rubber from scrap or used tires. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
