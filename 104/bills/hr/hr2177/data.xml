  <summary>8/3/1995--Introduced.
Exchange Stabilization Fund Amendments of 1995 - Amends Federal law regarding credit and monetary expansion to prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from granting any extension of credit to a single foreign entity or government unless the President certifies to certain congressional committees that: (1) there is no projected cost to the United States from the loan; and (2) any proposed obligation or expenditure of U.S. funds to or on behalf of the foreign government is adequately backed by an assured source of repayment to ensure that all Federal funds will be repaid. Prohibits the Secretary from making any such loan that would result in expenditures and obligations, including contingent obligations, aggregating more than $1 billion for more than 180 days during any 12-month period.</summary>
