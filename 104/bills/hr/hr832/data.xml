  <summary>2/6/1995--Introduced.
Amends Federal transportation law to limit to not more than six months' pay the amount of any wage continuation or severance benefit that may be received by any Amtrak employee terminated as a result of a discontinuance of intercity rail passenger service. Authorizes Amtrak to require an employee whose position is eliminated by such a discontinuance to transfer to any vacant position for which the employee can be made qualified on any part of Amtrak's system. Allows the employee, if such transfer requires a change in residence or seniority district, to choose: (1) a transfer to the position and coverage by the collective bargaining agreement of the seniority district to which the employee is transferred; or (2) a voluntary furlough at the employee's home location and receipt of protective benefits as limited by this Act.</summary>
