Repeals the prerequisite that such transfer take place only upon the making of specified certifications to the Congress by the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Board of Directors. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to mandate payment of Financing Corporation costs by all FDIC-insured depository institutions. Amends the FDIA to repeal the minimum assessment requirements for any deposit insurance fund (including SAIF) risk-based assessment system."
