(Sec. 101) Includes within the general program framework certain mandatory work, education, and job preparation requirements, as well as certain optional community service requirements, outlined in detail, as the primary program components for providing needy families either already having or expecting a child with the specific assistance and support services (including child care) they need to overcome any unique circumstances and become self-sufficient. Requires families to achieve such independence within a certain negotiated time-limited period (generally no more than five years except in certain cases involving minor children and hardship situations) pursuant to either a limited benefit plan or personal responsibility contract. Requires such instruments to be entered into with the particular participating State and to outline the steps for families to take to get off welfare after receiving an appropriate assessment by the relevant State agency's case manager of the family member's skills, prior work experience, and employability. Provides, additionally, within the general program framework for the following by participating States as subsidiary matters: (1) establishment of annual goals and institution of actions to prevent and reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, with respect to FY 1996 through 2000; (2) strategic plans for assessing program outcomes over a three-year period and estimating the total amount of State and local expenditures under the program for the fiscal year in which such plan is submitted; and (3) certain certifications that the State will, among other things, operate a child support enforcement program under SSA title IV part D, operate a child protection program under SSA title IV part B, and operate a foster care and adoption assistance program under SSA title IV part E. Allows States to determine the treatment of aliens and families moving inter-State under their respective State TEA plans. Details grant administrative provisions, including those for: (1) determining the amounts of State and Indian tribe grants under the TEA program; (2) outlining grant uses, with a limit on how much of the grant may be used for administrative purposes; (3) setting up a Federal loan program using the newly established Treasury Federal Loan Fund for State Welfare Programs for State TEA program anti-fraud and other specified activities; (4) providing for job placement performance bonuses for States based on the number of families that became ineligible for TEA program assistance as a result of unsubsidized employment; and (5) establishing a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs in the Treasury for payments to certain eligible States; (6) providing supplemental grant amounts for population increases in certain States; and (7) increasing grants for States that reduce out-of-wedlock births. Authorizes appropriations, including additional amounts for certain current SSA title IV part A demonstrations and for the cost of developing and evaluating innovative approaches for reducing welfare dependency and increasing the well-being of minor children, among other things. Penalizes States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments, allowing States to terminate such payments to certain adult family members without small children needing child care who refuse to engage in the required number of hours per week in mandatory program work and other activities. Limits the amount of any penalty reduction in the State's quarterly grant payment.

(Sec. 1117) Directs the Secretary to restructure the interdisciplinary program of research to provide information needed to better protect children from abuse or neglect and to improve the well-being of abused or neglected children, with at least a portion of such research being field initiated. Directs the Secretary to require research on additional specific issues, including research on: (1) the causes, prevention, assessment, identification, treatment, cultural and socio-economic distinctions, and consequences of child abuse and neglect; (2) incidence of substantiated and unsubstantiated reported child abuse cases; (3) number of unsubstantiated cases that result in a judicial finding of child abuse or neglect or related criminal court convictions; and (4) the extent to which the lack of adequate resources and adequate training of reporters has contributed to the inability of a State to respond effectively to serious cases of child abuse and neglect.

(Sec. 1119) Revises the program of mandatory development and operation grants to assist States in improving their child protective service systems in specified ways, including grant purposes (especially services to disabled infants), eligibility requirements (especially provision for prompt expungement of public records in unsubstantiated or false cases), and State program plan elements.

(Sec. 1124) Declares that nothing in such Act shall be construed: (1) as establishing a Federal requirement that a parent or legal guardian provide a child any medical service or treatment against the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian; or (2) requiring that a State find, or prohibiting a State from finding, abuse or neglect in cases in which a parent or legal guardian relies solely or partially upon spiritual means rather than medical treatment, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the parent or legal guardian. Requires a State, at a minimum, to have in place authority under State law to permit the State child protective service system to pursue any legal remedies, including the authority to initiate legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction, to provide medical care or treatment for a child when such care or treatment is necessary to prevent or remedy serious harm to the child, or to prevent the withholding of medically indicated treatment from children with life threatening conditions.

(Sec. 1306) Expresses the sense of the Senate that before the Senate acts on the conference report on either H.R. 4 or any other legislation including welfare reform provisions, the Congressional Budget Office shall prepare an analysis of the conference report to include estimates of the costs to States of requirements imposed on them by such legislation, the resources available to meet such requirements, and the amount of any additional revenue needed by the States to meet such requirements.
