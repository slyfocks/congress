    "date": "1995-06-27", 
    "text": "Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1995 - Mandates a report to specified congressional committees on current research and monitoring regarding Atlantic bluefin tuna and other highly migratory species, the personnel and budgetary resources allocated, and how each activity contributes to conservation and management. Amends Federal law to mandate a comprehensive research and monitoring program to support such conservation and management, including a comparable monitoring of all U.S. fishermen to which the law being amended applies regarding effort and species composition of catch and discards. Regulates procedures of the advisory committee established by the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975 (Tunas Act). Prohibits regulations by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas from increasing or decreasing any allocation or quota of fish or fishery mortality level to the United States (currently, from increasing or decreasing any allocation or quota of fish to the United States) agreed to under a Commission recommendation. Requires publication of a list of nations whose fishing vessels are fishing in the Convention area in a way inconsistent with Commission recommendations. Authorizes the President to negotiate with the government of those nations for agreements to end that inconsistent fishing and, when practicable, mitigate its negative impacts. Replaces provisions mandating civil penalties for violations of the Tunas Act with provisions applying fines and permit sanctions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to violations of the Tunas Act. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Tunas Act. Mandates an annual report to specified congressional committees. Declares that it is the sense of the Congress that: (1) in future Commission negotiations, the Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that recommended conservation actions provide fair burden sharing; (2) the U.S. Commissioners should, in 1995 Commission negotiations on swordfish and other highly migratory species, add enforcement provisions similar to those for bluefin tuna; and (3) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Customs Service should enhance monitoring activities regarding what stocks are being imported into the United States and the country of origin."
