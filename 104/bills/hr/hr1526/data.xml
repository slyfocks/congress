  <summary>4/7/1995--Introduced.
Defense Nuclear Waste Cleanup Privatization Act - Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into one or more contracts with facilities located within 25 miles of a current or former Department of Energy (DOE) defense nuclear facility for the procurement of products and services to support waste cleanup and modernization activities at such nuclear facilities. Requires the Secretary to give preference to facilities that plan to hire, to the maximum extent practicable, residents in the vicinity of the defense nuclear facility who are employed or who have previously been employed by DOE or its private contractor at the facility. Prohibits any person from bringing a claim against a contractor or subcontractor for injury, cost, damage, illness, death, damage to property, or economic loss caused by a release of a hazardous contaminant during performance of the contract, unless such release or threatened release is caused by contractor or subcontractor negligence or intentional misconduct. Sets forth a six year statute of limitations for commencement of such actions. Directs the Secretary and contractors under the Secretary's supervision, in entering into a contract or subcontract with a private entity for products to be acquired or services to be performed at a qualifying DOE site, to give preference to an entity (otherwise qualified and within the competitive range) that plans to: (1) provide products and services originating from communities within 25 miles of the site; (2) avert, to the maximum extent practicable, the dismissal of DOE or private DOE contractor employees at the site and protect their continuity of service and benefits; (3) hire residents living in the site's vicinity to perform the contract (especially those previously employed by DOE or its contractor at the site); and (4) invest in value-added activities in the site's vicinity to mitigate adverse economic development impacts resulting from closure or restructuring of the site.</summary>
