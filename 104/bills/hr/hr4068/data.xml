Veterans Medicare Subvention Demonstration Project Act - Directs the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to jointly establish a demonstration project to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs with reimbursement, under provisions of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, for health care services provided to certain Medicare-eligible veterans. Requires the Secretaries to conduct the project: (1) in not more than three Veterans Integrated Service Networks; and (2) during the three-year period beginning on January 1, 1997. Requires the Secretaries to include a provision for expanding the project to incorporate health care services provided to Medicare-eligible veterans under fee-for-service arrangements if the Secretaries determine that such expansion is feasible and advisable. Directs the HHS Secretary to make monthly payments to the Department from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (HHS trust funds) representing appropriate reimbursement amounts. Provides for the determination of such amounts. Directs the Secretaries to: (1) establish a minimum and maximum enrollment level for veteran participants in the project; and (2) determine baseline costs of such care and coverage. Directs the VA Secretary to: (1) establish and operate a managed health-care plan through which Medicare-eligible veterans who participate in the project receive health care; and (2) waive any enrollment fee for such participants. Directs the Secretaries to report to the Congress concerning specified project participation, findings, and results. Directs the Comptroller General, for each year of the project, to report to the Secretaries and the Congress on the extent to which the costs of the Secretaries have increased as a result of the project. Requires the Secretaries to modify the project following such reviews to correct any discrepancies between project cost targets and actual spending.</summary>
