    "text": "Savings Association Insurance Fund Stabilization Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to authorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to impose a one-time special capitalization assessment against Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) members. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer funds not needed by the Resolution Trust Corporation to the SAIF to cover its actual or anticipated losses. Repeals the prerequisite that such transfer take place only upon the making of specified certifications to the Congress by the Chairperson of the FDIC Board of Directors. Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to mandate payment of Financing Corporation costs by all FDIC-insured depository institutions. Amends the FDIA to repeal the minimum assessment requirements for any deposit insurance fund (including SAIF) risk-based assessment system."
