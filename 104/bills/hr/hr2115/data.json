National Voter Opportunity To Inform Congress Effectively (V.O.I.C.E.) on Term Limits Act of 1995 - Requires the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to certify to the appropriate State election agencies for inclusion on the 1996 general election ballot in every congressional district a national advisory referendum that poses the question of whether the Congress should approve a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms that a Member of Congress can serve in office. Requires States and territories to be reimbursed at four cents per voter for the costs incurred in placing the advisory question on ballots in November 1996. Authorizes appropriations for such reimbursement. Requires tabulation and certification of the election results under customary procedures. Makes the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate responsible for transmitting such results to each Member. Requires the results to be taken under advisement by the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees, with recommendations for response reported back to the Congress within six months of the general election. Requires the State election agencies to forward to the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate their comments or suggestions regarding changes or improvements in procedures for conducting national nonbinding referenda in future general elections."
