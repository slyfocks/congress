    "text": "Congressional Campaign Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to: (1) increase the amount a person may contribute to a candidate and his or her authorized political committees for an election for Federal office; and (2) decrease the amount a multicandidate political committee may contribute to a candidate and the candidate's political committees. Requires multicandidate political committees and separate regulated funds to: (1) provide a method so that each person contributing to such committee or fund may specify to which Federal candidate or national political party organization such contribution is being made; and (2) provide each contributor with a list of the names and addresses for the authorized committee of every candidate and for each national political party organization. Requires corporations and labor organizations to report to the Federal Election Commission (Commission) certain payments or services they furnish which are directly attributable to a registration or get-out-the-vote campaign. Sets forth disclosure requirements for independent expenditures through broadcast communications on any radio or television station. Requires a candidate to file with the Commission and each other qualifying candidate a declaration stating whether or not such candidate intends to expend funds and incur personal loans for the primary and general election in the aggregate of $100,000 or more from the following sources: (1) personal funds; (2) family funds; and (3) personal loans incurred in connection with the campaign. Allows the opponents of such candidate to accept larger contribution amounts from individuals. Allows a candidate to repay a personal loan in connection with the candidate's campaign from contributions made to such candidate or his authorized committee. Prohibits a candidate from making expenditures from personal funds or family funds, or from incurring personal loans in connection with the election campaign at any time within 60 days before such election. Prohibits a candidate who makes expenditures from his or her personal funds or those of his or her immediate family to his or her campaign committee, or makes a loan from such funds to such committee, from using post-election contributions made by any other person to repay any such expenditure or loan. Expands the definition of \"national committee\" to include the Democratic and Republican National Committees as well as their respective House and Senate campaign committees. Sets forth national committee reporting requirements. Revises contribution through intermediary provisions."
