  <summary>3/21/1996--Introduced.
Insurance Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence Act of 1996 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to create a new title prohibiting health insurers from: (1) discriminating against an individual or group because the individual or a family member is the subject of domestic violence; or (2) disclosing or being compelled (subject to exception) to disclose information concerning the status of an individual as a victim of domestic violence. Mandates development of model standards. Requires each State to report on its implementation actions and, where States fail to act, provides for Federal enforcement involving civil fines against insurers and a Federal private right of action. Provides for application of this Act to specified provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</summary>
