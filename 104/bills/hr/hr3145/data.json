Mandates development of model standards. Requires each State to report on its implementation actions and, where States fail to act, provides for Federal enforcement involving civil fines against insurers and a Federal private right of action. Provides for application of this Act to specified provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974."
