Prohibits outdoor tobacco product advertising (including outward facing retail window advertising) within 1000 feet of any playground or elementary or secondary school and according to such further restrictions as a State or subdivision may impose. Prohibits the promotion of tobacco products in family amusement centers or in accordance with such further restrictions as a State or subdivision may impose.
