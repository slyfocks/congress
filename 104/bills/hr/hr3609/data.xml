  <summary>6/10/1996--Introduced.
Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 through 2001 only for the payment of arrearages in assessed contributions to the United Nations for specified past fiscal years. Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 through 2001 for contributions to the United Nations for international peacekeeping activities, but only in an amount not greater than 25 percent of the total of all assessed contributions for any particular operation. Authorizes the President, after notification of the Congress, to withhold the payment of any appropriated funds authorized by this Act if the United Nations has failed to implement or to continue to implement consensus-based decisionmaking procedures on budgetary matters which assure that sufficient attention is paid to the views of the United States and other member states that are the major financial contributors to the United Nations.</summary>
