Requires such leases to be renewed or extended under their original terms and conditions. Grants renewal or extension of leases and permits to persons who held the leases or permits on November 10, 1978, or their heirs (currently, such persons). Allows the Secretary to terminate such lease or permit only for a breach of the specific conditions detailed in it. Directs the Secretary to grant the heirs of the person a renewal or extension of a lease or permit that was continued under the Act, that was held by a person who died after November 10, 1978, and that expired on or before this Act's enactment without being renewed or extended in the same manner as leases and permits are otherwise renewed or extended under the Act and under the same terms and conditions applicable to such leases or permits."
