Allows the deduction of foreign taxes for which the credit is made unallowable by this Act. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations regarding allocation of income and deductions which use a formulaic approach to clearly reflect income of multinational corporations. (Sec.104) Treats the gain or loss of a nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is a ten-percent shareholder in a domestic corporation upon disposition of such a corporation's stock as if the taxpayer were engaged during the taxable year in a trade or business within the United States and as if such gain or loss were attributable to a permanent U.S. trade or business establishment. Treats such gain or loss as from sources within the United States, notwithstanding source rules for personal property sales. Imposes a 26-percent minimum tax on nonresident alien individuals. Treats as stock, for purposes of these provisions, options or other rights to acquire a domestic corporation's stock, conversion features of debt instruments, and other interests in a domestic corporation other than those solely as a creditor. Treats as a dividend attributable to a domestic corporation's stock any gain which would be subject to tax but for a treaty and which results from a distribution in liquidation or redemption. Provides for the withholding of tax on such dispositions. Penalizes, and treats as tax evasion, the failure to pay the tax established by this Act where amounts were not deducted and withheld. Excepts such gain from the branch profits tax imposed on foreign corporations. Requires notice to the Secretary upon distributions by a U.S. person to a foreign person in redemption of stock or complete liquidation of a subsidiary. (Sec. 105) Removes the exemption of ten-percent shareholders from the tax on interest of nonresident alien individuals received from portfolio debt investments. Redefines portfolio interest as only interest paid on obligations issued by governmental entities. (Sec. 106) Terminates, effective with taxable years beginning January 1, 1996, the exclusion of foreign earned income and the housing cost amounts of U.S. citizens or residents living abroad. (Sec. 107) Terminates, effective with taxable years beginning January 1, 1996, the exclusion from gross income of exempt foreign trade income of foreign sales corporations. (Sec. 108) Revises rules for the determination of the income of controlled foreign corporations. Repeals provisions which reduce the controlled foreign corporation income of export trade corporations. (Sec. 109) Allows the Secretary to extend for an additional three years the limitation period for assessment of a foreign-related deficiency if the deficiency cannot be accurately assessed before the expiration of the usual three-year period because of delay or other taxpayer actions which prevented timely assessment of the deficiency. Defines a foreign-related deficiency as one: (1) of a 25-percent foreign-owned domestic corporation to the extent the deficiency is attributable to a transaction with a related party who is a foreign person; and (2) of a foreign corporation with respect to the tax on income for foreign corporations connected with U.S. business or the branch profits tax. Title II: Agricultural and Grazing Subsidies - Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to decrease the $250,000 payment limitation under the farm commodity programs to $50,000. (Sec. 202) Repeals Title III (export enhancement program) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. (Sec. 203) Eliminates tobacco price support and production adjustment programs. (Sec. 204) Amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to repeal provisions for the market promotion program. (Sec. 205) Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish, beginning with the grazing season which commences on March 1, 1996, an annual domestic livestock grazing fee equal to fair market value with respect to certain National Forest lands where domestic livestock grazing is permitted under applicable law. Title III: Aerospace and High-Technology Industry Subsidies - Terminates Federal assistance for Sematech. (Sec. 302) Terminates Federal assistance under defense technology reinvestment programs. (Sec. 303) Terminates funding for the space station program. Title IV: National Parks Concession Reform - Repeals the Concessions Policy Act of 1965. (Sec. 405) Provides for a competitive selection process with respect to the provision of public accommodations, services, and facilities within the National Park System. Directs the Secretary to promulgate appropriate regulations establishing such process. (Sec. 406) Provides for the setting of franchise fees. (Sec. 407) Limits a concessions contract entered into pursuant to this Act for a term not to exceed ten years. (Sec. 408) Prohibits the transfer of a concessions contract without prior notification to, and approval of, the Secretary. (Sec. 409) Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) structures and facilities within a park; (2) recordkeeping; and (3) lease requirements.
