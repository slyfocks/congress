  <summary>3/3/1995--Introduced.
Integrity in Government Act - Prohibits a recipient of an award, grant, or contract from engaging in, or having others engage in, lobbying for the: (1) continuation of the award, grant, or contract; (2) program under which it was made; or (3) continued funding of any program within, or the department or agency administering, such program. Requires any payment of a fine, penalty, or settlement required of a corporation resulting from a judicial action, threatened judicial action, or consent decree based on a violation of a Federal regulation to be paid only to the Treasury. Makes a tax-exempt organization ineligible for the receipt of Federal funds in the form of an award, grant, contract, or loan or in any other form. Repeals specified provisions of Federal law that: (1) grant a Federal charter to the National Education Association (a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the District of Columbia); (2) authorize the payment of expenses of a person who intervenes in proceeding involving the United States; and (3) authorize the payment of attorney's fees to prevailing parties.</summary>
