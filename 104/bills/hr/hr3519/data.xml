  <summary>5/23/1996--Introduced.
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1996 - Amends the Clean Air Act to define permit program "applicable requirements." Revises Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for permit programs regarding: (1) permitting authorities' requirements that a source obtain or modify a permit for a physical or operational change or another action prior to a date seven days after the change or action has begun; and (2) major stationary source permits that allow emissions increases and decreases at various units within the source without permit revision if certain overall emissions standards are met. Doubles the allowable term of a permit. Requires, before permit program-related sanctions are imposed, a determination by the EPA Administrator that such failure will cause the State to fail to attain a national primary ambient air quality standard by the applicable date. (Sec. 3) Repeals the authority of the Administrator to require enhanced monitoring of major stationary sources and revises compliance certification and method requirements. (Sec. 4) Adds a definition of "potential to emit" to treat physical or operational limits on a source's capacity to emit regulated air pollutants as part of the source's design if the limitation is effective. (Sec. 5) Requires, before sanctions are imposed for non-submittal, disapproval, or failure to implement requirements of a plan for a nonattainment area, a determination that the deficiency is likely to result in a failure by the State to attain a national primary ambient air quality standard by the applicable date. Makes the imposition of sanctions discretionary. (Sec. 6) Modifies the procedure for permit revision where the Administrator promulgates a hazardous air pollutant emission standard, after the permit's issuance, that would be applicable to the source in lieu of the limitation established by permit. (Sec. 7) Provides, with respect to plans for Moderate ozone nonattainment areas, for the crediting as reductions of certain voluntary measures implemented before designation as a nonattainment area. (Sec. 8) Expands the factors allowing extension, upon State application, of the primary standard attainment date for ozone. Allows extension for certain areas that qualified for attainment designation but subsequently violated the ozone standard. (Sec. 9) Shortens the time period and modifies the procedure for redesignation, upon State application, of an air quality control region. (Sec. 10) Requires the Administrator, when evaluating the adequacy of State implementation plans for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, to credit provisions designed to control air pollution only during certain periods during which pollutant levels are elevated. (Sec. 11) Imposes limitations on the inclusion, at a State's option, of ozone nonattainment areas in the prohibition requiring the sale of reformulated gasoline. (Sec. 12) Prohibits the Administrator from requiring that nitrogen oxide emissions from baseline (representative) vehicles using reformulated gasoline be less than emissions from such vehicles using "baseline" gasoline. (Sec. 13) Requires the promulgation of: (1) national primary ambient air quality goals that discount certain episodic weather-related variations; and (2) revised standards, using a cost-benefit analysis, as close to the air quality goals as is feasible. (Sec. 14) Removes limitations on Federal assistance for transportation activities not conforming to a State implementation plan. Considers the form and content of a State inventory and performance plan solely within the purview of a State and declares such a plan effective upon the Governor's approval unless disapproved by EPA within 30 days. Makes the standard for approval the plan's adherence to the State's own processes and procedures. (Sec. 15) Allows the upgrading of an ozone nonattainment area if the Administrator makes a specified determination concerning the inability of the area to control ozone concentrations resulting from downwind transport of ozone or precursors from another area. (Sec. 16) Requires inclusion, in an enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program for a Serious ozone nonattainment area, of enforcement through denial of safety inspection approval (as an alternative to denial of registration, as under current law). (Sec. 17) Requires the Administrator to approve an emissions trading program as part of an implementation plan unless certain attainment failures would result.</summary>
