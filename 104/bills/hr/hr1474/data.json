    "date": "1995-04-07", 
    "text": "Deposit Insurance Funds Management Improvement Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act regarding a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions to mandate that the designated reserve ratio for each insurance fund be: (1) at least 1.25 percent of the estimated insured deposits of its members; and (2) set at an amount which the Board of Directors (the Board) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation determines will provide for an appropriate amount of reserves against losses which may reasonably be expected to be incurred without resulting in an excessive buildup in the fund. Declares that the Board's authority to make semiannual assessments to maintain the reserve ratio at the designated reserve ratio includes authority to reduce such assessments by any appropriate amount if the reserve ratio of the insurance fund is equal to or greater than the minimum designated reserve ratio of such fund. Authorizes the Board, in setting the semiannual assessment rates for insured depository institutions, to consider any risk to the safety and soundness of any deposit insurance fund, its members, or the deposit insurance system as a whole which is posed by any difference between the assessment rate for Savings Associate Insurance Fund members and the assessment rate for Bank Insurance Fund members. Repeals the minimum assessment requirement for any insured deposit insurance fund."
