Medicare PET Coverage Act of 1995 - Provides that nothing in title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, or any other provision of law, regulation, policy, or interpretative statement, shall be construed to prohibit under Medicare parts A (Hospital Insurance) or B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) coverage of, and payment for, items and services associated with the use of positron emission tomography (PET) for a covered medical indication where the use meets specified conditions. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the Medicare national coverage decision relating to coverage of PET to be consistent with this Act. Provides that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing the Secretary from expanding such decision beyond the coverage required.</summary>
