  <summary>10/18/1995--Introduced.
Ethics in Foreign Lobbying Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit contributions and expenditures in Federal elections by multicandidate political committees or separate segregated funds sponsored by foreign-controlled (at least 50 percent owned by a non-U.S. citizen or foreign national) corporations and associations. Sets forth ownership and operating fund reporting requirements. Prohibits a foreign national from participating in the decision-making process of any person's (such as a corporation, labor organization, or political committee) election-related activities. Establishes within the Federal Election Commission a clearinghouse of existing public information regarding foreign principals' and agents' political activities. Amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended, to: (1) revise foreign agents' supplemental reporting requirements; and (2) provide civil penalties for specified reporting violations.</summary>
