Limits the Federal share to 25 percent of total project costs. Prohibits the Secretary from providing funds for project operation and maintenance. (Sec. 3) Authorizes either the Secretary or the non-Federal project sponsor to undertake water reclamation and reuse appraisal investigations. (Sec. 4) Adds elements to be considered under water reclamation and reuse feasibility studies. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to participate in the design, planning, and construction of the Long Beach Desalination Research and Development Project in Los Angeles County, California, and the Las Vegas Area Shallow Aquifer Desalination Research and Development Project. Limits the Federal share to 50 percent of total project costs. Prohibits the Secretary from providing funds for project operation and maintenance. (Sec. 6) Extends by one year the due date of a report from the Secretary to specified congressional committees with regard to the San Francisco Area Water Reclamation Study. (Sec. 7) Conditions the appropriation of funds for the construction of any project authorized under the Act on: (1) the completion of an appraisal investigation and a feasibility study; (2) a determination by the Secretary that the non-Federal project sponsor is financially capable of funding its share of project costs; and (3) approval by the Secretary of a cost-sharing agreement with such non-Federal sponsor. Excludes from such conditions those projects for which funds were appropriated prior to January 1, 1996. Directs the Secretary to notify specified congressional committees within 30 days after the signing of a cost-sharing agreement under this section.
