Telecommunications Drug Enforcement Act of 1995 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize a Government attorney or State investigative or law enforcement officer to apply for an order requiring a mobile radio services licensee to discontinue service to a mobile radio unit if an appropriate court finds that there is probable cause to believe that the unit is transmitting or receiving communications in connection with the illegal manufacture, distribution, or sale of a controlled substance. Requires such mobile unit holder to be notified within three days of issuance of the court order. Preserves all rights of such holder to contest such ruling.</summary>
