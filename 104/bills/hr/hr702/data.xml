Displaced Defense Worker Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of Defense to deposit in the Displaced Defense Worker Trust Fund established under this Act the Secretary's portion of any cost savings achieved and returned by a Department of Defense contractor if such savings are a result of the consolidation of operations in a manner that causes the elimination of jobs in the community in which the contract is being carried out. Directs the Secretary of Labor to use amounts appropriated from the Fund for: (1) job retraining assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act; and (2) job creation activities under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Appropriates to the Fund all cost savings realized by the Secretary under this Act. Provides for Fund management. Requires an annual report from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Congress on the financial condition and operations of the Fund during the preceding fiscal year and those expected for the next five fiscal years.</summary>
