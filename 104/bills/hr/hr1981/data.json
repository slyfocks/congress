Prohibits an agency from procuring such property and services except: (1) under a contract awarded under competitive procedures; and (2) subject to the supervision of the Director. Authorizes, under specified conditions, the head of an agency to use Government personnel to operate a motor vehicle fleet of the agency rather than contracting for the procurement of motor vehicle fleet services from private sector sources only if there are demonstrated greater cost-efficiencies achieved by agency operation of the fleet. Requires the amount expended by all agencies for FY 1996 through 2000 for the operation of motor vehicle pools and systems to be reduced by $200 million (or approximately ten percent) below the amount expended by them for such operation in FY 1995."
