  <summary>5/16/1995--Introduced.
Antitrust Reform Act of 1995 - Authorizes Bell operating companies (BOCs) to apply to the Attorney General, notwithstanding the Modification of Final Judgment entered into on August 24, 1982 (AT&amp;T consent decree), for authorization to provide alarm monitoring services or interexchange telecommunications services. Requires such application to describe with particularity the nature and scope of each activity and of each product, service, and geographic market for which authorization is sought. Sets forth provisions concerning application procedures, determinations by the Attorney General, and judicial review of such determinations. (Sec. 4) Prohibits a BOC, until one year after this Act's enactment, from manufacturing or providing telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment, with qualified limitations on such activities after such period. Makes an exception for previously authorized activities. (Sec. 5) Prohibits a BOC with monopoly power in any exchange service market area from: (1) discriminating in any relevant market, between itself or an affiliated enterprise and any other person or between any two such other persons, with respect to any product or service related to the provision or use of telecommunications service if the effect is to substantially lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce; and (2) using proceeds obtained from providing exchange service in such market to subsidize, in any relevant market, specified activities if the effect may be to substantially lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. (Sec. 6) Provides for enforcement of this Act through the U.S. Attorney's Office, including a private right of action with injunctive relief.</summary>
