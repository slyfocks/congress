    "text": "Park Renewal Fund Act - Amends the Land and Water Conservation Act to authorize the sale of annual admission permits to National Park visitors for a fee. Designates that the annual park permit shall be called the Golden Eagle Passport. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to determine the fees and conditions for issuing permits. Authorizes the administering Secretary to charge reasonable admission fees for a single visit for those visitors who choose not to purchase an annual permit. Deletes the provision prohibiting an admission fee at an urban park location which provides significant outdoor recreation opportunities and which has multiple points of access. Directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to establish procedures for discounted admission fees for U.S. citizens over the age of 62. Provides that the discount shall be nontransferable and given regardless of the method of travel. Requires the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to develop procedures to grant persons who have been medically determined to be permanently disabled with a lifetime admission permit to National Parks. Allows one accompanying individual to enter the park with the permittee. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit to the Congress within six months of the Act's enactment a report on the entrance fees to be charged at National Parks. Allows admission fees to be charged at the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial, Independence National Historic Park, any unit of the National Park System within the District of Columbia, Arlington House, San Juan National Historic Site, and Canaveral National Seashore. Deletes the provision requiring the Director of each park unit to designate one day during periods of high visitation as a \"Fee-Free Day.\" Allows any National Park permit holder to use specialized recreation facilities at a rate of 50 percent of the established use fee. Requires fees to be comparable to those charged by other public and private entities. Permits persons violating National Park rules or regulations to be fined any amount as provided by law. Authorizes the National Park Service to charge a fee for fishing in areas where State fishing licenses are not required. Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to withhold money from the special account which equals the amount of money spent on fee collection costs for the immediately preceding fiscal year. Directs that the additional revenue generated by the fees shall be used to cover infrastructure needs at the parks. Directs the Secretary to develop procedures for the use of the fund to ensure accountability and demonstrated results. Deletes the provision allowing the head of the fee collecting agency to enter into an agreement with public or private entities to sell annual admission permits. Allows individual units of the National Park System to retain money earned from transporting persons visiting the park. Directs the park to use the money for costs associated with the transportation systems at the unit. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a flat fee for commercial tour vehicles based upon the commercial tour use fee rate and the current admission rates. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to establish reasonable fees for non-recurring commercial or non-recreational uses of National Park System units that require special arrangements. Requires the fees to cover the costs of services provided. Authorizes the individual park unit to keep the portion of the fee necessary to cover the cost of providing services. Requires that any additional funds be deposited into the National Park Renewal Fund. Prohibits fees for the use of any federally owned land except as provided for in this Act. (Sec. 3) Prohibits the use of Highway 209 within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area by commercial vehicles after noon on September 30, 2005. Exempts commercial vehicles serving businesses within the vicinity of the recreation area. (Sec. 4) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into challenge cost-share agreements with cooperators. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept, as well as solicit, donations on behalf of the National Park System. Permits employees of the National Park Service to solicit donations in limited circumstances. Instructs the Secretary of the Interior to issue written guidelines regarding the policy of employees soliciting donations. (Sec. 6) Defines \"park system resource\" to mean any living or non-living resource located within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System, except for those owned by a non-Federal entity. Describes \"marine or aquatic park system resource\" as any living or non-living part of a marine or aquatic regimen within, or within the boundaries of, a unit of the National Park System, except for those resources owned by a non-Federal entity."
