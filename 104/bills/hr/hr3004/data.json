Revises the statewide average interval between surveys from 12 months to whatever the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish consistent with the 36-month maximum interval and the need to assure the delivery of quality home health services. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary's authority to deem a hospital to have met certain conditions or requirements if the Secretary finds that accreditation by a national accreditation body provides reasonable assurance that such conditions or requirements have been met. Repeals certain other requirements to justify such a \"deeming status.\" Requires the Secretary to treat a Medicare provider (whether hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or other qualified health services facility) as meeting applicable requirements or standards if the entity has been determined to meet them by a national accreditation body that determines compliance in a manner comparable to that in which a State agency would otherwise determine compliance."
