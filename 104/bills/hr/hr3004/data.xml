  <summary>3/5/1996--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to extend from 15 months to 36 months the maximum period permitted between standard surveys of home health agencies. Revises the statewide average interval between surveys from 12 months to whatever the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish consistent with the 36-month maximum interval and the need to assure the delivery of quality home health services. Changes from discretionary to mandatory the Secretary's authority to deem a hospital to have met certain conditions or requirements if the Secretary finds that accreditation by a national accreditation body provides reasonable assurance that such conditions or requirements have been met. Repeals certain other requirements to justify such a "deeming status." Requires the Secretary to treat a Medicare provider (whether hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or other qualified health services facility) as meeting applicable requirements or standards if the entity has been determined to meet them by a national accreditation body that determines compliance in a manner comparable to that in which a State agency would otherwise determine compliance.</summary>
