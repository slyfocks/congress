TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Department of Veterans Affairs Title II: Department of Housing and Urban Development Title III: Independent Agencies Title IV: Corporations Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 - Title I: Department of Veterans Affairs - Makes appropriations for FY 1996 to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Provides for the use of such appropriations. (Sec. 107) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reimburse the general operating account of the Department, for certain administrative costs, from the National Service, Veterans' Special, and U.S. Government Life Insurance Funds. (Sec. 108) Authorizes the Secretary to transfer jurisdiction and control of certain land in Wichita, Kansas, to the Secretary of Transportation. Title II: Department of Housing and Urban Development - Makes appropriations for FY 1996 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Provides for the use of such appropriations. (Sec. 201) Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA), as amended by the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Additional Disaster Assistance, for Anti-terrorism Initiatives, for Assistance in the Recovery from the Tragedy that Occurred at Oklahoma City, and Rescissions Act, 1995, to authorize public housing agencies to provide modernization assistance to mixed-income developments. (Sec. 202) Revises USHA provisions relating to public and assisted housing rents, income adjustments, and preferences. Sets minimum rents between $25 and $50 per month, at the discretion of public housing agencies (PHAs). Allows PHAs to set ceiling rents which reflect the market value of similar housing in the area and cover monthly operating costs. Permits PHAs to make adjustments to income in determining the rents to be paid by tenants. Revises the basis of fair market rentals established for the Section 8 program. Eliminates Federal preferences rules for occupancy in the section 8 housing and rent supplement programs, and allows local preference rules to be applied. (Sec. 203) Provides for conversion of certain public housing to vouchers. Requires each PHA to: (1) identify any distressed public housing developments that meet specified criteria; and (2) develop and carry out a plan in conjunction with the Secretary for their removal from the PHA inventory and the annual contributions contract, over a period of up to five years (with possible extensions for up to another five years in certain circumstances). Directs the Secretary to make authority available to a PHA to provide section 8 tenant-based assistance to families residing in any development that is removed from the PHA inventory and the annual contributions contract. Requires each conversion plan to require the PHA to notify and counsel families residing in such a development, and ensure that they are offered tenant-based or project-based assistance and relocated, as necessary, to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice. (Sec. 204) Repeals a "take one-take all" requirement under USHA that a housing owner who accepts a Section 8 voucher holder as a tenant must accept all others. Exempts housing unit owners participating in the certificate and voucher programs from certain notice requirements relating to rent increases or termination of their assistance payment contracts with a PHA. Limits certain requirements to the duration of a lease. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary to establish section 8 fair market rentals for FY 1996 based on the 40th percentile rent of rental distributions of standard quality rental housing units, considering only the rents for dwelling units occupied by recent movers and not the rents for public housing dwelling units or newly constructed rental dwelling units. Declares that the administrative fee for each month of FY 1996 for which a dwelling unit is covered by an assistance contract under the section 8 certificate, voucher, or moderate rehabilitation program shall be equal to the monthly fee payable for FY 1995.
