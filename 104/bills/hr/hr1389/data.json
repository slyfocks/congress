Increases the income phaseout limits on the deduction for active participants in employer-maintained pension plans. Provides an inflation adjustment for deductible amounts and the phaseout limits beginning after 1995. Allows the full IRA deduction to a spouse who had less than $1,000 of compensation and who has a child under the age of six who is the taxpayer's dependent. Allows distributions from qualified retirement plans without penalty to: (1) pay higher education expenses or business start-up expenditures; (2) pay for certain medical expenses; (3) assist certain unemployed individuals; and (4) purchase first homes. Imposes a minimum tax on certain foreign-owned and foreign corporations."
