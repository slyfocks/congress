Requires transfer costs to be borne by the recipients. Terminates the transfer authority two years after enactment of this Act, except for lease renewals. Directs the Secretary to encourage recipient countries to have such vessels repaired or refurbished at U.S. shipyards. Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the President from transferring excess vessels to North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and certain other countries on a grant basis."
