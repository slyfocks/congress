  <summary>5/25/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to require importers of civil aircraft that have been entered duty-free to: (1) maintain such supporting documentation as the Secretary of the Treasury may require; and (2) certify that such imported article is a civil aircraft, or has been imported for use in civil aircraft and will so be used. (Currently, importers must file a statement, along with the supporting documentation, with the appropriate customs officer stating that such article is and will be used as a civil aircraft, or that it has been imported for use in civil aircraft, and that it has been approved for such use by the Federal Aviation Administration.)</summary>
