  <summary>7/13/1995--Introduced.
Parental Choice in Television Act of 1995 - Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to prescribe rules that: (1) on the basis of recommendations from an advisory committee, identify and rate video programming that contains sexual, violent, or other material about which parents should be informed; and (2) require distributors of video programming to transmit signals that contain the rating of the program being distributed and permit parents to block the display of the video programming. Voids such requirement if program distributors, within one year, have established voluntary rules to the same effect. Directs the FCC to require televisions with a picture screen 13 inches or greater which are manufactured or imported for use in the United States to be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers to block the display of channels, time slots, and programs, as well as allow viewers to block displays of all programs with a common rating. Prohibits the shipment in interstate commerce, the manufacture, the assembly, or the importation from any foreign country into the United States of any such televisions except in accordance with FCC rules. Exempts those carriers who are not trading the televisions. Directs the FCC to prescribe rules providing for FCC oversight of the blocking standards adopted by the industry and requiring that every television with a picture screen 13 inches or greater will be able to receive ratings signals that conform to the signal and blocking specifications established by industry.</summary>
