  <summary>12/27/1995--Introduced.
Amends Federal law with respect to the general restriction against acceptance by a Federal or a District of Columbia (D.C.) government officer or employee of voluntary services for either government, or employment of personal services exceeding that authorized by law, except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property (essential employees). Deems all Federal and D.C. government officers and employees to be performing such emergency services (thus deeming them all to be essential employees). Makes such amendment only for the period December 15, 1995, through February 1, 1996.</summary>
