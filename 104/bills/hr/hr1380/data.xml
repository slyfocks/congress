  <summary>4/3/1995--Introduced.
Truth in Lending Class Action Relief Act of 1995 - Amends the Truth in Lending Act to declare a moratorium between the enactment of this Act and October 1, 1995, on court certifications of any class in any action brought under such Act with respect to any credit transaction: (1) not under an open end credit plan secured by a first lien on real property or a dwelling, which constitutes a refinancing or consolidation of an existing extension of credit; and (2) based on the alleged failure of a creditor to include in the disclosed finance charge a charge actually incurred in connection with the transaction, or to properly make any other required disclosure as a result of such failure, or to provide proper notice of rescission rights owing to selection by the creditor of the incorrect form from among prescribed model forms (or forms based on them). Specifies exceptions to such moratorium.</summary>
