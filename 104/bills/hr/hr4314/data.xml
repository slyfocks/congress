(Sec. 309) Provides that: (1) no judicial officer shall be held liable for any costs, including attorney's fees, in any action brought against such officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, unless such action was clearly in excess of such officer's jurisdiction; and (2) injunctive relief shall not be granted in any action brought against a judicial officer for an official act or omission, unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable.
