Title II: Judicial Process Improvements - Amends the Federal judicial code to expand the duties of a magistrate on an emergency assignment in a judicial district other than the one for which he or she has been appointed. (Sec. 202) Provides for registration of a judgment in an action for the recovery of money or property entered in any court of appeals or bankruptcy court, as well as any district court, by filing a certified copy of the judgment, subject to specified requirements. (Sec. 203) Provides that when: (1) the office of clerk of court is vacant, the deputy clerks shall perform the duties of the clerk in the name of the last person who held that office; and (2) the clerk is incapacitated, absent, or otherwise unavailable to perform official duties, the deputy clerks shall perform such duties. (Sec. 205) Repeals a Federal judicial code provision authorizing the parties to consent to appeals of decisions by magistrate judges in civil cases to a judge of the district court in the same manner as with respect to appeals from a judgment of the district court to a court of appeals. (Sec. 206) Requires each judicial council, by January 31 of each year, to submit a report to the Administrative Office on orders entered during the preceding calendar year relating to judicial misconduct or disability.

Requires any such consent and waiver to be made in writing or orally on the record. Authorizes the magistrate judge: (1) in a case involving a juvenile and a petty offense that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, to exercise powers granted to the district court; and (2) in any other class B or C misdemeanor case involving a juvenile in which consent to trial before a magistrate judge has been filed, to exercise such powers. Modifies the Federal judicial code regarding powers of U.S. magistrates to grant the power to enter a sentence for a petty offense that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, and for a class A misdemeanor or a class B or C misdemeanor not covered by such provision in a case in which the parties have consented.

(Sec. 309) Provides that: (1) no judicial officer shall be held liable for any costs, including attorney's fees, in any action brought against such officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's judicial capacity, unless such action was clearly in excess of such officer's jurisdiction; and (2) injunctive relief shall not be granted in any action brought against a judicial officer for an official act or omission, unless a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable. Title IV: Judicial Financial Administration - Amends the Federal judicial code to increase the civil action filing fee in U.S. district court from $120 to $150. Modifies the allocation of filing fees to the special fund of the Treasury to be available to offset funds appropriated for the operation and maintenance of U.S. courts. (Sec. 402) Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office to: (1) prescribe a uniform fee for examinations for qualified interpreters; and (2) include in any contract for the development or administration of such examinations a provision permitting the contractor to collect and retain fees in payment for contractual services.

Sets forth provisions regarding the precedence of judges in acting as chief judge.
