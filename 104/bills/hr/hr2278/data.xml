Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995 - Prohibits the importation of spent nuclear fuel unless: (1) the Congress has approved a repository with storage or disposal capacity for all the spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactors and atomic energy defense activities; and (2) such repositories are federally licensed and operating. Exempts from such proscription: (1) samples of spent nuclear fuel imported for testing and evaluation for national security reasons; and (2) imports from countries not authorized to possess nuclear weapons under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but which are known or suspected to be producing or developing nuclear weapons. Provides guidelines which a port authority may use to ensure the safe unloading, transfer, and shipment of spent nuclear fuel through its port.</summary>
