  <summary>3/12/1996--Introduced.
Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to declare it to be the policy of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to extend to licensed FM translator stations operating in a county of more than 750,000 persons that lacks a commercial FM station assignment: (1) authority (effective upon written notification to the FCC from the station licensee) for local programming origination, provided such a station abides by all FCC rules and regulations regarding program material, content, and schedule; and (2) authority (effective upon grant of a minor change application for construction permit) to operate with an effective radiated power not to exceed 1,000 watts, if the station is not located within 320 kilometers (approximately 199 miles) of either the Canadian or Mexican borders, such station's interfering contour would not create a new area of overlap attributable only to the station within the protected contour of a cochannel or first-adjacent channel facility, and the station complies with FCC requirements.</summary>
