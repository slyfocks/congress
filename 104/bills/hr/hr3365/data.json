Abolishes the Black Canyon National Monument and incorporates all lands and interests therein as part of the Park. Establishes in Colorado: (1) the Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area (conservation area); (2) the Curecanti National Recreation Area (recreation area); (3) the Denver and Rio Grande National Historic Site (consisting of the Denver and Rio Grande rolling stock and train trestle at Cimarron) and the Curecanti Archeological District located within the recreation area; and (4) the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park Complex (consisting of the Park, the conservation area, the recreation area, and portions of the Gunnison National Forest). Requires the Secretary of the Interior to transmit to specified congressional committees: (1) a comprehensive plan for the long-range protection and management of the conservation area; and (2) a comprehensive list of authorizing documents issued by the Bureau of Reclamation, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Forest Service for the use of lands within the recreation area. Directs the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, with respect to areas within their jurisdictions, to: (1) provide for appropriate general recreation and multiple use activities, including swimming, fishing, boating, rafting, hiking, horseback riding, camping, and picnicking and, subject to valid existing rights, grazing and hay harvesting and the maintenance of roads, stock driveways, and utility rights-of-way; (2) permit limited off-road vehicle use within the recreation area; and (3) permit hunting, fishing, noncommercial taking of fresh-water crustaceans, and trapping (except that hunting and trapping are prohibited within the Park and in such zones and periods as the Secretaries may designate).
