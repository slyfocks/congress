  <summary>7/10/1996--Passed Senate amended.
Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1995 - Amends the National Labor Relations Act to allow employers to establish, assist, maintain, or participate in an organization or entity in which employees participate, to at least the same extent practicable as do representatives of management, to address matters of mutual interest (including, but not limited to, issues of quality, productivity, efficiency, and safety and health), if such organizations or entities do not have, claim, or seek authority to: (1) be the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees; or (2) negotiate, enter into, or amend collective bargaining agreements. Makes such amendment inapplicable in any case in which a labor organization is the representative of such employees (any unionized workplace). Provides that nothing in this Act shall affect employee rights and responsibilities contained in provisions other than the specific provision amended.</summary>
