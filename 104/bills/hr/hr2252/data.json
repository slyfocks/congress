Requires selection, to the extent practicable, of schools that: (1) have a high percentage of students from single-parent homes or homes where both parents work; (2) are located in economically depressed communities with high percentages of individuals with alcohol and other drug abuse problems and individuals involved in gang activities; and (3) are equitably distributed among various regions and among rural and urban areas. Directs the Secretary to study and report to the President, the Congress, and each pertinent State educational agency on the effects of such academic year extension. Authorizes appropriations."
