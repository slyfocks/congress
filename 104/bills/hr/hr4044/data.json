    "text": "Safe and Responsible Handgun Act of 1996 - Directs: (1) the Secretary of the Treasury to establish guidelines for the establishment by each State of a Handgun Roster Board; and (2) each Board to publish a roster of types of handguns which may be lawfully manufactured, sold, owned, possessed, or used (manufactured) in the State and any terms, conditions, or circumstances under which such handgun types may be manufactured and to transmit a copy of the roster to each licensed dealer in the State who is not prohibited by State law from dealing in handguns. Sets forth factors to be considered in deciding whether to include a handgun type on the roster, including concealability, safety features, and detectability by standard security equipment used at airports or courthouses. Requires States to have in effect such laws as necessary to prohibit the manufacture, sale, ownership, possession, and use of: (1) any handgun which is of a type not specified on the roster; and (2) any handgun which is of a type specified on the roster, except under such terms and conditions as the Board may specify. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) penalties for the unlawful manufacture, sale, or offer for sale of a handgun; (2) State compliance; and (3) ineligibility of States not in compliance for formula grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Directs the Secretary to establish an Independent Study Group to devise an effective national firearms injury reporting system."
