Specifies that obligations for a project or activity be at a rate of operations not exceeding the lesser of: (1) the rate of operations provided for in the regular appropriation Act, including a continuing resolution; or (2) in the absence of such an Act, the rate of operations provided for such project or activity in the preceding fiscal year. Requires that the authority to obligate be made available for the period beginning with the first day of such fiscal year and ending with the earlier of: (1) the enactment date of the applicable regular appropriation bill for such fiscal year, regardless of whether such law provides for such project or activity; or (2) the last day of such fiscal year. Sets forth provisions concerning the authority to obligate for a project or an activity during a fiscal year."
