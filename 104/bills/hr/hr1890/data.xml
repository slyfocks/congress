Prohibits: (1) the head of a Federal agency from issuing a lease, permit, or license for exploration for, or development or production of, minerals in or from the Zone; (2) a person from engaging in such activities after the date of the cancellation, expiration, transfer, relinquishment, or termination of a lease, permit, or license for such activities, the date of the suspension of operations associated with such activities under regulations implementing the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act as in effect on January 1, 1986, or the date on which a lease, permit, or license for such activities in any way becomes inactive; or (3) an agency head from issuing a lease, permit, or license for ocean incineration or harmful ocean dumping within the Zone or for any onshore facility that facilitates ocean incineration or harmful ocean dumping within the Zone. Declares that this Act is not intended to regulate, restrict, or prohibit commercial or recreational fishing, or other harvesting of ocean life in the Zone.</summary>
