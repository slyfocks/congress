TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Abolition of Interstate Commerce Commission Title II: Surface Transportation Board Title III: Conforming Amendments Subtitle A: Amendments to United States Code Subtitle B: Other Amendments Title IV: Miscellaneous Provisions ICC Termination Act of 1995 - Title I: Abolition of Interstate Commerce Commission - Abolishes the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). (Sec. 102) Amends Federal transportation law to transfer jurisdiction over rail carrier transportation from the ICC to the Surface Transportation Board established by this Act. Declares that remedies provided under this Act are exclusive and preempt any Federal or State remedies. Subjects local governmental authorities providing transportation services to Federal laws governing: (1) safety; (2) representation of employees for collective bargaining; and (3) employment retirement, annuity, and unemployment systems. Requires the Board to exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service from its jurisdiction whenever: (1) application of this Act is not necessary to carry out U.S. rail transportation policy; and (2) either the transaction or service is of limited scope, or jurisdiction is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power. Requires rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Board to establish rates, classifications, through routes, rules and practices for rail transportation that are reasonable and that do not unreasonably discriminate against a participating carrier.
