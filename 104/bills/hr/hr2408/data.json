(Sec. 103) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Attorney General to establish a fraud and abuse control program for coordinating Federal, State, and local efforts towards controlling such fraud and abuse. (Sec. 104) Amends title XI of the Social Security Act (SSA) to authorize the Secretary to identify opportunities to satisfy any community service obligations imposed by a court for a health care fraud and abuse conviction. (Sec. 105) Outlines provisions for the solicitation and publication of modifications to existing safe harbors and new safe harbors. Provides for advisory opinions by the Secretary under SSA title XI. Details provisions for special fraud alerts by the HHS Inspector General with regard to possible fraudulent health care practices. Title II: Revisions to Current Sanctions for Fraud and Abuse - Revises current sanctions under SSA titles XI and XVIII (Medicare) for health care fraud and abuse, with changes providing for: (1) mandatory exclusion from participation in Medicare and State health care programs for an individual convicted of a felony relating to health care fraud or to a controlled substance; (2) establishment of a minimum period of exclusion for certain individuals and entities subject to permissive exclusion from such programs; (3) permissive exclusion of individuals with ownership or control interest in sanctioned entities; (4) changes involving Medicare health maintenance organization intermediate sanctions; and (5) repeal of the \"unwilling or unable\" condition for imposition of certain sanctions.
