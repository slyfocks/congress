(Sec. 303) Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to authorize a court or magistrate judge, upon application by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to issue an order ex parte directing a consumer reporting agency (CRA) to furnish to the FBI the names and addresses of all financial institutions at which the consumer maintains or has maintained an account. Authorizes the court or magistrate judge to issue the order upon finding that: (1) such information is necessary for the conduct of an authorized foreign counterintelligence investigation; and (2) there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the consumer is a foreign power or a person who is not a U.S. person and is an official of a foreign power, or is an agent of a foreign power and is engaging in or has engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities that involve a violation of U.S. criminal statutes. Specifies that such an order shall not disclose that it is issued for purposes of a counterintelligence investigation. Sets forth provisions regarding CRA furnishing of identifying information respecting a consumer, court orders for disclosure of consumer reports, confidentiality, payment of fees, limits on dissemination, reporting requirements, damages and disciplinary actions for violations (with a good faith exception), and injunctive relief. (Sec. 304) Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize a court or magistrate judge, upon application of the FBI Director, to issue an order ex parte directing any common carrier, public accommodation facility, physical storage facility, or vehicle rental facility to furnish any records in its possession to the FBI. Directs the court or magistrate judge to issue the order upon finding that such records are sought for foreign counterintelligence purposes and that there are specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the person to whom the records pertain is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power and is engaging or has engaged in international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities that involve or may involve a violation of U.S. criminal statutes. Specifies that such an order shall not disclose that it is issued for purposes of a counterintelligence investigation. Sets forth provisions regarding limits on, and penalties for, disclosure. (Sec. 305) Requires the Attorney General to conduct a study concerning: (1) the tagging of explosive materials for purposes of detection and identification; (2) technology for devices to improve the detection of explosives materials; (3) whether common chemicals used to manufacture explosive materials can be rendered inert and whether it is feasible to require it; and (4) whether controls can be imposed on certain precursor chemicals used to manufacture explosive materials and whether it is feasible to require it. (Sec. 306) Makes the statutory exclusionary rule concerning intercepted wire or oral communications inapplicable to the disclosure by the United States in a criminal trial or hearing or before a grand jury of the contents of a wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom if any law enforcement officers who intercepted the communication or gathered the evidence acted with the reasonably objective belief that their actions were in compliance with Federal criminal code provisions. (Sec. 308) Grants temporary emergency wiretap authority involving terrorist conspiracies and expanded authority for multipoint wiretaps. (Sec. 310) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) access to telephone billing records by law enforcement agencies (including provision for a civil remedy and disciplinary action for violations); and (2) a requirement for providers of wire or electronic communication services to preserve record evidence.

(Sec. 314) Repeals Federal criminal code provisions regarding rewards. Authorizes the Attorney General to pay rewards and receive from any department or agency funds for the payment of rewards to any individual who provides any information unknown to the Government leading to the arrest or prosecution of any individual for Federal felony offenses. Requires the Attorney General to give notice to the Senate and House of Representatives if the reward exceeds $100,000. Makes the Attorney General's decision whether to authorize an award unreviewable. Sets forth provisions regarding protection of the identity of the recipient of a reward or of the members of the recipient's immediate family. Bars any officer or employee of any governmental entity from receiving a reward for conduct in performance of official duties. Permits the participation of any individual (and his or her immediate family) who furnishes information which would justify a reward, at the Attorney General's discretion, in the witness security program. (Sec. 316) Authorizes the Attorney General to prohibit: (1) vehicles from parking or standing on any street or roadway adjacent to any building in the District of Columbia which is wholly or partly owned, possessed, used by, or leased to the Federal Government and used by Federal law enforcement authorities; and (2) any person or entity from conducting business on any property immediately adjacent to any such building.

Title V: Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit (with exceptions) the manufacture, importation, exportation, shipment, transport, transfer, receipt, or possession of any plastic explosive which does not contain a detection agent. Prohibits any person (other than a U.S. agency or the National Guard of any State) possessing any plastic explosive on the effective date of this title, from failing to report to the Secretary of the Treasury the quantity of such explosives possessed, the manufacturer or importer, any identification marks, and such other information as the Secretary may prescribe. (Sec. 503) Sets forth: (1) penalties for violations of this title; and (2) affirmative defenses. (Sec. 505) Directs the Attorney General to exercise authority over specified violations of this title. Grants the Attorney General primary investigative responsibility in any matter involving a terrorist or revolutionary group or individual. Directs the Secretary to assist the Attorney General as requested. Title VI: Immigration-Related Provisions - Subtitle A: Removal of Alien Terrorists - Part 1: Removal Procedures for Alien Terrorists - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to establish procedures for the removal of alien terrorists. Requires the Chief Justice of the United States to publicly designate five district court judges to constitute a court with jurisdiction to conduct all special removal proceedings. Makes provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 applicable to proceedings under this title. Directs the special removal court to provide for the designation of a panel of attorneys, each of whom has a security clearance and has agreed to represent permanent resident aliens with respect to classified information.
