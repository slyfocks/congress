Directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to provide guidance to agencies to standardize measures of costs and benefits in such accounting statements as well as their format. Requires the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, after each accounting statement and associated report are submitted, to make recommendations to the President for improving such statements and reports."
