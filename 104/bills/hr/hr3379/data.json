Requires the Congressional Budget Office's Director to determine, certify, and inform the Congress regarding whether that plan achieves a balanced budget. Requires the Congress, if the budget is certified as not being balanced, to return the budget to the President. Amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to make it not in order in the House to consider any budget concurrent resolution unless it provides for a balanced budget. Allows the House to waive that rule if a declared war is in effect or the United States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution which becomes law. Prohibits the Rules Committee from reporting any rule or order waiving that rule."
