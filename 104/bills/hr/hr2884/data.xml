  <summary>1/25/1996--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, if a law is enacted which is projected to balance the Federal budget in seven fiscal years, to include in income tax instruction booklets: (1) an explanation of such law; and (2) a pie- shaped graph showing the projected relative sizes of the major outlay categories for each of such seven fiscal years. Limits the requirement to apply only to instruction booklets for taxable years beginning more than six months after enactment.</summary>
