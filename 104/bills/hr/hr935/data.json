Requires the copyright arbitration royalty panels to determine, adjust, and publish such reasonable fees taking into account the average fair market price for comparable programming provided by cable systems and satellite carriers to other places of public accommodation in the same local geographic area. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to make provisions relating to prohibition of specified practices of unauthorized publication or use of communications inapplicable to the interception, receipt, and display of video programming at a place of public accommodation of any game between professional sports teams if the copyright owners for public performance of such game receive a reasonable fee from the owner or operator of the place of public accommodation."
