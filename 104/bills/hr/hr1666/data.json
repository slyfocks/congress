Provides that termination of such extension by the Secretary shall take effect only after 180 days' notice of the Secretary's intention to terminate it. Conditions an extension upon: (1) the annual payment by its recipient of a specified amount based on the value of the property (requires such payments to be retained by the Secretary and made available for maintenance and administration of the Lakeshore); and (2) agreements by the recipient to assume all responsibilities for repairs and maintenance, to indemnify and hold harmless the United States for any liability in connection with such property, and to make pro rata payments to local governments for services provided."
