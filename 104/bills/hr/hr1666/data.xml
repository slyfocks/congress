  <summary>5/17/1995--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Interior to notify all owners of improved property (a detached one-family dwelling constructed between December 31, 1964, and October 21, 1970, and used openly and continuously at least during the summer months as a residential dwelling) located within the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan of their right to extend their retained right of use and occupancy in the Lakeshore for 99 years after this Act's enactment. Provides that termination of such extension by the Secretary shall take effect only after 180 days' notice of the Secretary's intention to terminate it. Conditions an extension upon: (1) the annual payment by its recipient of a specified amount based on the value of the property (requires such payments to be retained by the Secretary and made available for maintenance and administration of the Lakeshore); and (2) agreements by the recipient to assume all responsibilities for repairs and maintenance, to indemnify and hold harmless the United States for any liability in connection with such property, and to make pro rata payments to local governments for services provided.</summary>
