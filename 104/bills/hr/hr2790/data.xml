  <summary>12/15/1995--Introduced.
Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to declare that nothing shall be construed to prevent States from imposing fees for initial facility certification and survey. Limits such fees to the State's expenses (or average of the expenses) in conducting the certification and survey. Prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from paying a State for reasonable certification and survey costs to the extent covered by such fees.</summary>
