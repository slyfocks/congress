  <summary>9/17/1996--Introduced.
Bi-State Aircraft Noise Correction Act of 1996 - Declares that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should remedy the problem it has created by formulating and implementing plans to mitigate aircraft noise over certain areas of New Jersey and Staten Island. Instructs the FAA Administrator to: (1) develop and publish a plan to reduce aircraft-generated noise in New Jersey by six decibels for at least 80 percent of the people residing within 18 nautical miles of Newark International Airport; (2) investigate and test southbound departure procedures from Newark International Airport runway 22 that will result in a minimum 25 percent decrease in aircraft noise on the ground in northwestern Staten Island; (3) investigate a straight-out southbound departure from runway 22; and (4) undertake remediation efforts to mitigate aircraft noise within a specified sound level contour. Confers standing in Federal district court upon the New Jersey Citizens for Environmental Research (and a group to be designated by the Staten Island Borough President) to compel the Administrator to comply with this Act. Sets deadlines for FAA implementation of this Act.</summary>
