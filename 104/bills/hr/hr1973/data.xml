  <summary>6/30/1995--Introduced.
Reduces the number of Department of Defense Operational Support Aircraft: (1) after September 30, 1996, to no more than two-thirds of the number available as of June 1, 1995; and (2) after September 30, 1997, to no more than one-half of the number of such aircraft available as of June 1, 1995, except if the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Congress that additional aircraft are needed for wartime purposes or to retain aircrew readiness. Directs the Secretary of Defense to: (1) designate the Secretary of one of the military departments to administer the maintenance and operation of all fixed-wing aircraft which previously had performed the functions of Operational Support Aircraft; (2) issue regulations for maintaining, operating, and using the fixed-wing aircraft; and (3) designate the United States Transportation Command as the manager for all fixed-wing Operational Support Aircraft. Reduces by half the number of Department of Defense helicopters used for administrative purposes (excluding support of the President) in the National Capital area after September 30, 1996. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on implementation of this Act and on the number of fixed-wing aircraft in the Department's inventory as of June 1, 1995.</summary>
