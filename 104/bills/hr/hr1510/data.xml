  <summary>4/7/1995--Introduced.
Department of Energy Laboratories Efficiency Improvement Act - Prohibits the Department of Energy (DOE) from implementing Federal, State, and local environmental, safety, and health standards with respect to nondefense DOE laboratories. Requires the number of individuals employed at nondefense Government-owned, contractor-operated departmental laboratories to be reduced by one-third within ten years after enactment of this Act. Requires such reductions to be consistent with specified objectives. Requires the Secretary of Energy to transmit to the Congress a report that: (1) identifies the extent to which DOE and departmental laboratory staffs have been reduced; (2) explains the extent to which such reductions have been made consistent with the specified objectives; and (3) along with each presidential annual budget submitted, explains the extent to which such reductions have been made.</summary>
