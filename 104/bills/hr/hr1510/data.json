Requires such reductions to be consistent with specified objectives. Requires the Secretary of Energy to transmit to the Congress a report that: (1) identifies the extent to which DOE and departmental laboratory staffs have been reduced; (2) explains the extent to which such reductions have been made consistent with the specified objectives; and (3) along with each presidential annual budget submitted, explains the extent to which such reductions have been made."
