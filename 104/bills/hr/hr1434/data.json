    "text": "WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission Act - Establishes the WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission to review reports of dispute settlement panels or the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in proceedings initiated by other WTO parties which are adverse to the United States and which are adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. Requires the Commission to determine whether the panel or the Appellate Body: (1) exceeded its authority; (2) added to the obligations of or diminished the rights of the United States; (3) acted arbitrarily or capriciously, engaged in misconduct, or demonstrably departed from proper procedures; and (4) deviated, in its report, from the applicable standard of review. Requires the Commission, upon an affirmative determination on one or more of these questions, to further determine whether the action of the panel or the Appellate Body materially affected the outcome of its report. Requires the United States Trade Representative, upon enactment of a joint resolution directing such action, to negotiate to amend or modify the rules and procedures of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes with respect to any affirmative determinations submitted to the Congress concerning the action of a panel or the Appellate Body. Provides for a joint resolution withdrawing congressional approval of the WTO agreement, ending U.S. participation in the WTO, if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory solution. Sets forth provisions governing the participation in WTO panel proceedings of private U.S. persons supportive of the U.S. Government position at issue."
