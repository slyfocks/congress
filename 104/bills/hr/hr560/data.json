(Sec. 103) Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) to provide for inservice training to familiarize Border Patrol personnel with the rights and varied cultural backgrounds of aliens and citizens. Authorizes FY 1996 appropriations. (Sec. 105) Increases FY 1996 personnel levels in: (1) the Wage and Hour Division with the Employment Standards Administration of the Department of Labor, and assigns such additional personnel to areas with high concentrations of undocumented aliens; and (2) the Investigations Division within INS, and assigns such additional personnel to investigate violations of the employer sanctions provisions of the Act. (Sec. 107) Increases the number of Assistant United States Attorney positions, and assigns such additional personnel to prosecute persons who harbor or bring illegal aliens into the United States. (Sec. 108) Prohibits the transportation of illegal aliens for employment purposes. (Sec. 109) Prohibits Federal financial assistance to localities whose officials refuse to cooperate in the arrest and deportation of illegal aliens. (sec. 110) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Attorney General and the Secretary of State should initiate programs with Mexico and Canada to prevent and prosecute the smuggling of aliens into the United States. Title II: Immigration Document Fraud Prevention - Provides for: (1) the replacement of current alien registration cards with new counterfeit-resistant identification cards (which shall not be considered national identity cards) for all resident aliens eligible to work in the United States; (2) a national program to educate employers about their responsibilities under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the uses of such cards; and (3) a demonstration program to determine the feasibility of a computerized telephone worker verification system for employers. Authorizes FY 1996 and 1997 appropriations. Title III: Restrictions on Alien Eligibility for Welfare - Prohibits direct Federal financial benefits or social insurance benefits (including aid to families with dependent children, supplemental security income, food stamps, and public housing assistance) to aliens who are not lawful permanent residents. Prohibits unemployment benefits to aliens who have not been granted employment authorization under Federal law. Makes a limited exception from this prohibition for benefits under the old age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI) program, but prohibits taking into account unauthorized wages paid on or after enactment of this Act in crediting quarters of coverage for the OASDI program under the Social Security Act."
