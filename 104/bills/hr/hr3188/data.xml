Crude Oil Transportation Fairness Act of 1996 - Amends Federal transportation law to exempt persons who offer crude oil and condensate for transport from certain registration and fee requirements if the person transfers title to the crude oil to the transporter at the time such oil is initially transported from a storage location. Limits the maximum annual registration fee the Secretary may charge a person filing a registration statement to $250 (currently, the fee shall be between $250 and $5,000).</summary>
