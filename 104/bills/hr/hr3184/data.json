Directs that, in any fiscal year, a non-Federal entity have either a single audit or a program-specific audit if such entity expends a total Federal award amount in excess of a specified amount. Sets forth audit requirements and exceptions. Requires the non-Federal entity to transmit a reporting package to a Federal clearinghouse and make it available for public inspection within a specified time frame."
