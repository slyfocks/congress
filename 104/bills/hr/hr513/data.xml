  <summary>1/13/1995--Introduced.
Welfare and Teenage Pregnancy Reduction Act - Amends title IV of the Social Security Act to repeal part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) and replace it with a program of block grants to States for such families. Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for such grants. Prohibits the use of grant funds to provide assistance with respect to a dependent child if: (1) the mother or father has not reached age 19; or (2) the paternity or maternity of such child has not been established. Declares that, during the first year following arrival in a State from another State of a family with a dependent child, the State may apply its own rules or the rules of that other State. Authorizes the Secretary to suspend or withhold part or all of a grant to a State for a fiscal year if, after reviewing the State's annual report on its program, the Secretary determines that the State program has not, during the immediately preceding fiscal year, adequately met the needs of such families. Directs the Secretary to take necessary action to ensure that, for each fiscal year, the total administrative costs of the AFDC program, as revised by this Act, shall not exceed half of the total administrative costs of the AFDC program as in effect for FY 1994.</summary>
