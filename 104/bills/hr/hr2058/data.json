    "text": "China Policy Act of 1995 - Urges the President to undertake diplomatic initiatives to persuade China to: (1) immediately and unconditionally release Harry Wu from detention; (2) adhere to international standards regarding the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction by, among other things, halting the export of ballistic missile technology and the provision of other weapons of mass destruction assistance, in violation of international standards, to Iran, Pakistan, and other countries of concern; (3) respect the internationally-recognized human rights of its citizens; (4) curtail excessive modernization and expansion of its military capabilities, and adopt defense transparency measures that will reassure its neighbors; (5) end provocative military actions in the South China Sea and elsewhere that threaten China's neighbors, and work with them to resolve disputes peacefully; (6) adhere to a rules-based international trade regime in which existing trade agreements are fully implemented and enforced, and equivalent and reciprocal market access is provided for U.S. goods and services there; (7) comply with the prohibition on all forced labor exports to the United States; and (8) reduce tensions with Taiwan. Requires the President to report to the Congress on: (1) the actions taken and the progress achieved by the United States with respect to these objectives; and (2) the actions taken in light of them with respect to China by the United Nations and other international organizations, including the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. Commends: (1) the men and women who have expressed their concerns to the Government of the People's Republic of China in the form of petitions; and (2) the democracy movement as a whole for its commitment to the promotion of political, economic, and religious freedom. Amends the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 to require the Director of the USIA to submit to the Congress a plan for the establishment of Radio Free Asia to broadcast into China. Requires Radio Free Asia to commence broadcasting to China within 90 days after enactment of this Act."
