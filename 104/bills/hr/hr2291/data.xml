Amends Federal law to authorize appropriations for and to extend the Administrative Conference of the United States through FY 1998. Declares that Conference members shall participate in Conference activities solely as private individuals without official responsibility on behalf of the U.S. Government and, therefore, shall not be considered to hold an office of profit or trust for purposes of the eighth clause of Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution. Declares that a majority of the members of the Conference shall constitute a quorum with regard to final actions taken by the Conference Assembly. Revises the Conference Chairman's compensation to set it at level III of the Executive Schedule.</summary>
