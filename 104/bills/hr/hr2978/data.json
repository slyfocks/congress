Revises the computation of a survivor annuity similarly to reflect commencement of the survivor annuity, in the event that the Federal retiree should die after separation but before commencement of the deferred annuity. Provides that the survivor of a former employee under CSRS who dies after separating from service but before commencement of such employee's deferred annuity shall be accorded the same treatment as would apply in those circumstances under FERS."
