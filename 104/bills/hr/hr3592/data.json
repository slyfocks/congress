Specifies total costs, estimated Federal and non-Federal costs, and funding sources and requirements. Authorizes the Secretary to carry out specified projects for navigation, bluff stabilization, flood damage reduction, water supply, storm damage reduction, and shoreline protection in Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, and South Carolina in accordance with a final report of the Chief of Engineers, if such report is completed by December 31, 1996. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to study and, if feasible, carry out, specified projects regarding: (1) flood control in California, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, and West Virginia (sets forth the maximum amounts of Federal funds that may be allotted for specified projects in California and Nebraska); (2) bank stabilization in Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee; (3) navigation in Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and New York; (4) shoreline protection in Connecticut, Florida, and New York; (5) snagging and sediment removal in Minnesota; (6) habitat and environmental restoration in California; and (7) channel restoration and environmental improvement in Utah.

Title II: Generally Applicable Provisions - Revises: (1) cost sharing provisions of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 regarding dredged material disposal areas (and deletes provisions crediting non-Federal interests with the value of dredged material disposal areas provided); (2) the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 to require any Federal agency, in the survey, planning, or design of a project involving flood protection, to consider and address in adequate detail nonstructural alternatives to prevent or reduce flood damages; and (3) Federal law regarding shore protection, including expressing congressional intent to assist projects that involve the replacement of sand on beaches and modifying the process for determining the cost- benefit ratio of a shore protection project to require that benefits provided to the local and regional economy and ecology be considered. Directs the Secretary to ensure that dredged material disposal facilities do not result in unfair competition with potential private sector providers of such facilities. (Sec. 202) Increases from 25 to 35 percent the non-Federal share for nonstructural and other flood control projects. Sets forth criteria and procedures relating to the ability of a non-Federal interest to pay for flood control or agricultural water supply.

(Sec. 206) Authorizes the Secretary: (1) to carry out specified aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection projects; (2) in developing and carrying out a project for navigation involving the disposal of dredged material, to select a disposal method that is not the least-cost option under specified circumstances where the incremental costs are minimal and the benefits to the aquatic environment justify its selection; and (3) to undertake surveys, plans, and studies to encourage innovative and environmentally sound engineering solutions to problems of national significance. (Sec. 211) Sets forth provisions regarding construction of flood control projects by non-Federal interests, including reimbursement and credit of the non-Federal interest under specified circumstances. (Sec. 215) National Dam Safety Program Act of 1996 - Requires the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: (1) in consultation with appropriation Federal agencies, State dam safety agencies, and a National Dam Safety Review Board (established by this section) to establish and maintain a coordinated national dam safety program; (2) to develop a dam safety improvements implementation plan; (3) at the request of a State, to provide training for State dam safety staff and inspectors; and (4) to engage in specified research activities. Authorizes the Secretary to maintain and periodically publish information on the inventory of dams. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 217) Directs the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal sponsors of navigation projects for development of long-term management strategies for controlling sediments. (Sec. 218) Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a program to evaluate and implement opportunities for public-private partnerships in the design, construction, management, or operation of dredged material disposal facilities in connection with construction or maintenance of Federal navigation projects. Title III: Project Modifications - Provides for modifications to specified flood control, navigation, beach erosion control, hurricane damage prevention, fish and wildlife loss mitigation, shoreline protection, and other projects in Alabama, Arizona, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
