(Sec. 4) Requires the United States Trade Representative to enter into discussions with representatives from member and prospective member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to report to the Congress on the extent to which: (1) the secondary boycott of Israel has distorted trade; (2) members and prospective members of the WTO encourage actions, including the furnishing of information or entering into agreements, which support the boycott; (3) the WTO should work to eliminate the secondary boycott; and (4) General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) articles can be used to eliminate compliance with such boycott. (Sec. 5) Requires the President to report to the Congress on progress made to end the boycott. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary of Commerce to report to the Congress on OECD countries that encourage or fail to discourage compliance with such boycott. (Sec. 7) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Office of Antiboycott Compliance of the Department of Commerce should continue exercising its functions for at least two years after the Arab League renounces: (1) the boycott of Israel by Arab countries; (2) the secondary boycott; and (3) any requirement that a business enterprise comply with such boycott."
