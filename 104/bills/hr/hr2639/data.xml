  <summary>11/15/1995--Introduced.
Prohibits the disbursement of basic pay to a Member of Congress during any period in which: (1) there is a lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution; or (2) the Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached. Prohibits a Member of Congress (including the Speaker of the House of Representatives and any Majority or Minority Leader or Whip of either chamber) from using Government-funded vehicles or personnel for purposes of transportation during any period referred to in this Act, except for a medical emergency. Provides that the congressional gymnasiums, during such period, shall be deemed as non-essential and remain closed.</summary>
