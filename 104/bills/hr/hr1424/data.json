(Sec. 223) Requires the head of each Federal agency responsible for provision of health insurance or of health care services to individuals to develop promptly health care comparative value information. Subtitle D: Preemption of State Quill Pen Laws - Preempts any State law that requires medical or health insurance records (including billing information) to be maintained in written rather than electronic form. Title III: Anti-Fraud - Subtitle A: Criminal Prosecution of Health Care Fraud - Amends the Federal criminal code to impose penalties upon a health care provider that knowingly engages in any scheme or artifice to defraud a person in connection with the provision of health care. (Sec. 302) Authorizes the Attorney General to pay a reward of up to $10,000 to a person who furnishes information unknown to the Government relating to a possible prosecution for health care fraud, with exceptions. Subtitle B: Coordination of Health Care Anti-Fraud and Abuse Activities - Amends the Social Security Act to provide for: (1) the application of Federal health anti-fraud and abuse sanctions to all fraud and abuse against any health insurance plan; and (2) treble damages for making or causing to be made false statements or representations involving Medicare or State health care programs, for illegal remuneration, and for false statements or representations with respect to the condition or operation of health care institutions. Directs the Secretary, in consultation with State and local health care officials, to: (1) identify opportunities for the satisfaction of community service obligations that a court may impose upon the conviction of a criminal offense involving Medicare or State health care programs; and (2) make information concerning such opportunities available to Federal and State law enforcement officers and State and local health care officials.

(Sec. 403) Directs the Attorney General to publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting proposals for additional safe harbors and to review and report to the Congress on proposed safe harbors. Sets forth criteria in establishing safe harbors, including: (1) the extent to which a competitive or collaborative activity will accomplish an increase in health care access and quality, the establishment of cost efficiencies, and increased ability of health care facilities to provide services in medically underserved areas or to underserved populations; and (2) whether designation as a safe harbor will result in specified desirable outcomes. (Sec. 404) Directs the Attorney General to issue certificates of review for providers of health care services and to assist persons in applying for such certificates. Sets forth provisions regarding applications for, revocation of, and review of determinations regarding such certificates. Limits the disclosure of information.
