TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Child Labor Free Labeling Standards Title II: Child Labor Free Commission Title III: Recognition of Exemplary Corporate Efforts Title IV: Definitions Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1996 - Title I: Child Labor Free Labeling Standards - Directs the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations to ensure that a label using any term or symbol denying the use of child labor does not make a false statement or suggestion that the article or section of wearing apparel or sporting good was not made with child labor. Requires such standards to encourage the use of an easily identifiable symbol or term indicating that the article or section of wearing apparel or sporting good was not made with child labor. (Sec. 101) Requires a producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or other person intending to use any such label to notify the Child Labor Free Commission (CLFC, established under title II of this Act) within 60 days after the product bearing that label becomes available to the public for purchase. Requires the Commission to review the notification. Authorizes the Secretary to charge a fee to cover the expenses of the CLFC in reviewing a notification. Makes it a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA) for any producer, importer, exporter, distributor, or seller of any article of wearing apparel (or section of an article of wearing apparel) or sporting good that is exported from or offered for sale in the United States to: (1) falsely indicate on the label or the packaging of that item that the item was not made with child labor; or (2) otherwise falsely claim or suggest that the item was not made with child labor. Amends FTCA to prescribe civil penalties for such violations. Establishes in the Treasury the Free the Children Fund for receipt of such penalties. Authorizes annual appropriations of such amounts in the Fund for specified educational and other programs to eliminate child labor. (Sec. 102) Directs the CLFC to assist the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) by reviewing petitions alleging violations of the labeling standards under this Act. (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Commerce, upon discovering a violation of this Act in the course of an investigation, to report it to the Secretary of Labor, who will review such report and, as appropriate, refer the violation to the FTC for enforcement under FTCA. Title II: Child Labor Free Commission - Establishes the Child Labor Free Commission (CLFC). (Sec. 202) Directs the CLFC to: (1) assist the Secretary of Labor in developing child free labor labeling standards, and in developing and implementing a compliance system; and (2) commence developing an easily identifiable labeling standard that the Secretary of Labor shall issue to encourage the use of voluntary labels assuring consumers that an article of wearing apparel or sporting good was made without the use of sweatshop or exploited adult labor. Title III: Recognition of Exemplary Corporate Efforts - Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) issue annual reports concerning companies making exemplary progress in ensuring that products they make, sell, or distribute are not made with abusive and exploitative child labor; and (2) develop and implement, with the CLFC, other methods of recognizing such exemplary company programs. Title IV: Definitions - Defines child as an individual who has not attained the age of: (1) 15 years, as measured by the Julian calendar; or (2) 14 such years, for a resident of a country that, by law, so defines a child.</summary>
