  <summary>5/16/1995--Introduced.
Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Conversion Act - Requires the U.S. Government to: (1) disable and dismantle all its nuclear weapons and refrain from replacing them at any time with weapons of mass destruction; (2) undertake vigorous good faith efforts to eliminate war, armed conflict, and all military operations; (3) actively promote policies to induce all other countries to join in these commitments for peace on earth; and (4) redirect resources that are currently being used for nuclear weapons programs to constructive, ecologically beneficial peacetime activities and to address human needs such as housing, health care, education, agriculture, and environmental protection. Makes this Act effective when the President certifies to the Congress that all foreign countries possessing nuclear weapons have established legal requirements comparable to those set forth in this Act.</summary>
