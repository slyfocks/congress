Requires the Under Secretary for Health to ensure that: (1) at least three centers designated under this section emphasize research into means of improving the quality of care for veterans suffering from mental illness through the development of community-based alternatives to institutional treatment; and (2) information produced through such centers that may be useful for other VHA activities is appropriately disseminated.
