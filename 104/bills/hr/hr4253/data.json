    "text": "Children's Financial Security Act of 1996 - Directs the Secretary of the Treasury or a delegate to transfer each calendar year, from the general fund of the Treasury and for each calendar year, $1,000 to the Child Retirement Account (CRA) of each eligible child. Makes eligible any individual who as of the close of such calendar year: (1) is a citizen or resident alien of the United States; and (2) has not attained age six. Allows the applicable taxpayer, in the case of children below age 19 as of the close of 1996, to contribute, during 1997 and 1998 only, to the child's CRA an amount equal to the lesser of $6,000 or the product of $1,000 and the child's age as of the close of 1996. Reduces the amount of any Federal or parental contribution for children of high-income parents, according to a phaseout range formula. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt CRAs from the income tax, but not from the tax on unrelated business income of charitable organizations. Requires the withholding of a 20 percent tax on any distribution from a CRA (although such distributions shall not be included in gross income). Provides for qualified special purpose distributions for first-time homebuying and for higher education expenses (along with a specified credit against the 20 percent distribution tax)."
