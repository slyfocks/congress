    "text": "Revolving Door Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set forth new provisions prohibiting public officials, within a specified period following termination of their public service, from knowingly making, with intent to influence, any communication or appearance before congressional or executive branch officials or employees, on behalf of any other person seeking official action (lobbying). Prohibits the following individuals, for two years after termination of their service or employment, from lobbying any Member, officer, or employee of Congress: (1) the President or Vice President; (2) Members of Congress; (3) individuals who serve in executive agency positions on a full-time basis, who have a rate of basic pay of at least $70,000, and who are not appointees of the senior foreign service or as uniformed service commissioned officers; and (4) officers or employees of Congress with a rate of pay of $70,000 or above. Prohibits: (1) Members of Congress, the President or Vice President, such executive branch employees, or such congressional employees, for two years after termination of their service or employment, from lobbying any officer or employee of an executive department or agency; (2) Members of Congress or such congressional employees, for five years after termination of their service, from lobbying any congressional committee Members or employees who are members of, or employed by, the committee on which such former Members served or for which such employee worked; or (3) the President, Vice President, or such executive branch employees, for five years after termination of their service or employment, from lobbying any officer or employee of the department or agency in which such person served. Prohibits such a Member, officer, or employee of the Congress from knowingly, after leaving such position, holding a supervisory position over any person who is likely to lobby Congress or executive agencies. Bans any former Member of Congress who is convicted of a felony from lobbying. Applies restrictions on lobbying on behalf of foreign entities to lobbying on behalf of foreign nationals. Prohibits such a Member, officer, or employee of Congress, after leaving such office, from lobbying on behalf of a foreign national for compensation. Provides that nothing in this Act shall prevent an individual from: (1) making requests for appointments, status of Federal action, or other similar ministerial contacts if there is no attempt to influence an officer or employee of the legislative or executive branch; (2) making communications in response to a notice in the Federal Register, Commerce Business Daily, or other similar publication soliciting communications from the public and directed to the agency official specifically designated in such notice; (3) making communications or appearances in compliance with written agency procedures regarding an adjudication conducted by an agency under adjudication provisions; or (4) submitting written comments filed in a public docket and other communications that are made on the record. Requires compensation recovered pursuant to imposition of a civil penalty upon former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches for violation of lobbying restrictions to be deposited in the Treasury for deficit reduction. (Sec. 3) Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit an individual who has excess campaign funds and is neither a candidate for, nor an incumbent of, a Federal office and who is registered under the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act from making any contribution from such excess campaign funds to another individual who is a candidate for Federal office or to any authorized committee of such other individual. (Sec. 4) Amends rule XXXII of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit lobbyists from being entitled to the privilege of admission to the Hall of the House and rooms leading thereto. (Sec. 5) Prohibits any former Member of Congress who is registered under the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act from being permitted to enter any dining area of the Capitol or any gymnasium facility which is reserved for Members."
