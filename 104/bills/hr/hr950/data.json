(Sec. 101) Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to the Congress on a revision of the AFDC limit on automobiles in order to increase the employability of AFDC recipients. (Sec. 102) Provides for State agency exclusion from AFDC eligibility determinations of certain resources related to microenterprise initiatives by AFDC recipients towards self-sufficiency. Requires State agencies to ensure that caseworkers advise AFDC recipients of the option for microenterprises. Provides for the inclusion of microenterprise training and activities in the JOBS program under SSA title IV part F (Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program). Title II: Demonstration Projects - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a deduction for contributions made to an individual development account (IDA) by or on behalf of a qualified individual to pay qualified expenses of such individual. Limits such contributions to $2,000 per year. Defines qualified expenses as those for: (1) postsecondary educational expenses; (2) a first-home purchase; and (3) retirement. Allows such deduction in arriving at adjusted gross income. Declares that contributions to IDAs are not subject to the gift tax or the tax on prohibited transactions. (Sec. 203) Provides for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine: (1) the social, psychological, and economic effects of providing to individuals with limited means an opportunity to accumulate assets; and (2) the extent to which an asset-based welfare policy may be used to enable individuals with low income to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Requires each organization authorized to conduct a demonstration project to establish a Reserve Fund for use in a prescribed manner. Requires the Secretary to establish an oversight panel to: (1) develop guidelines for investment of Reserve Fund and IDA monies; (2) monitor project progress; and (3) make recommendations for projects not progressing adequately, and review their implementation. Makes an individual eligible for assistance under a demonstration project if such individual is a member of a household that meets: (1) the income test of not more than 200 percent of the poverty threshold; and (2) the net worth test of not more than $20,000. (Sec. 204) Requires the disregard by all means-tested Federal programs of funds in the IDAs of demonstration project participants."
