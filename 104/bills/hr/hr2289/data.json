Authorizes the Secretary to approve the issuance of, and guarantee timely payment of principal and interest on, certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of mortgage loans representing Department of Veterans Affairs-guaranteed housing loans, as long as such securities are issued on or before December 31, 2000 (currently, December 31, 1995). (Sec. 102) Requires specified veterans' housing loan information to be included in a current annual Department budget report required to be submitted to the Congress. Repeals superseded reporting requirements under the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992. (Sec. 103) Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to: (1) extend through FY 1998 the authorization of appropriations for homeless veterans' reintegration projects; (2) revise the amount of appropriations authorized for FY 1997 and 1998; and (3) extend through FY 1998 the general authorization of appropriations and the authority under such Act. Title II: Veterans' Employment and Training - Directs the Secretary of Labor to assign regional administrators for the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (Service) in at least five geographic regions of the United States. (Currently, such representatives are required for each region for which the Secretary operates a regional office.) (Sec. 202) Authorizes the hiring of other support personnel for Directors and Assistant Directors for the Service. Revises eligibility requirements for persons appointed as Directors and Assistant Directors in any State for at least two years. (Sec. 204) Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to conduct a pilot program under which the primary responsibilities of local veterans' employment representatives will be case management and the provision and facilitation of direct employment and training services to veterans. Limits the pilot program to no more than five States. Requires reports to the Congress and the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees. Terminates pilot program authority on October 1, 1998. Title III: Employment and Reemployment Rights of Members of the Uniformed Services - Requests the prompt reemployment of persons upon completion of any military service. (Currently, such request is limited to those who completed such service under honorable conditions.) Revises generally: (1) provisions prohibiting discrimination or acts of reprisal against persons who exercise certain employment or reemployment rights provided under current law, whether or not such person has performed military service; and (2) provisions guaranteeing reemployment rights to persons who serve in the armed forces. (Sec. 306) Prohibits an employer from requiring a person engaged in military service to use vacation, annual, or similar leave during such period of service. (Sec. 309) Allows a person to submit a complaint against the Office of Personnel Management for the enforcement of any employment or reemployment right. (Sec. 313) Empowers the Secretary, in conducting investigations concerning employment and reemployment rights of former military personnel, to interview persons with information relevant to such investigation. (Sec. 314) Provides transition rules and effective dates."
