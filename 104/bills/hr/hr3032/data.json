Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) such waiver would not be inconsistent with the overall purposes of the statute or regulation. Limits the application of any such waiver only to funds or guarantees used for activities in such a disaster area. Prohibits the Secretary from waiving or specifying alternative requirements under this Act for any statutory or regulatory requirements relating to fair housing or nondiscrimination, the environment, or labor standards."
