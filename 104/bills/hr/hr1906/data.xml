  <summary>6/21/1995--Introduced.
Central Valley Project Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Central Valley Project Improvement Act to redefine: (1) "anadromous fish" to exclude striped bass, sturgeon, and American shad; (2) "Central Valley Project water" to mean water developed, diverted, stored, or delivered by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with statutes authorizing the Central Valley Project (CVP) and with the terms and conditions of water rights permits or licenses acquired by or issued to the United States pursuant to California law; and (3) "repayment contract" and "water service contract" to exclude contracts which contain terms or agreements for water rights settlements or exchanges. (Sec. 4) Prohibits the Secretary from entering into any new short- term, temporary, or long-term contracts or agreements for water supply from the CVP for any purpose other than fish and wildlife before the Secretary has completed appropriate environmental review and has determined that there is sufficient water to meet existing contractual and legal obligations. Directs the Secretary, upon request, to renew any existing long- term repayment or water service contracts which provide for the delivery of water from the CVP for a period of 25 years and to renew such contracts for successive 25-year periods. Validates and ratifies all contracts renewed by the Secretary since January 1, 1988, with an exception. (Sec. 5) Revises provisions regarding: (1) water transfers; (2) water conservation standards; (3) fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration; and (5) the CVP Restoration Fund. (Sec. 8) Directs the Secretary, on a priority basis and within two years, to develop and submit to the Congress a least-cost plan to increase CVP yield by the amount reserved and managed for fish and wildlife purposes and otherwise required to meet CVP purposes. Authorizes and directs the Secretary to coordinate with California in implementing measures for the long-term resolution of problems in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. Directs the Secretary to identify the water supply impacts resulting from the reallocation of Stanislaus River water for fish and wildlife purposes and to develop and implement a plan to provide long- term replacement water in an amount equal to the identified impacts on out-of-basin entities which have contracted with the Secretary for water from the New Melones Project.</summary>
