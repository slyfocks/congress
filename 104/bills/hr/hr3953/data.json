Requires employment standards for air carrier and airport security personnel to include performance standards for airport and airline security personnel, including counter personnel, and guidelines for encouraging the retention of security personnel responsible for passengers and cargo. Direct the FAA, the Secretary of Transportation, the intelligence community, and the law enforcement community to continue to assist air carriers in developing computer-assisted passenger profiling programs. (Sec. 106) Permits the use of airport improvement project grant funds and passenger facility fees to expand and enhance air transportation security programs and other activities at airports to ensure the safety and security of passengers and others involved in air travel. (Sec. 107) Requires the Administrator to review: (1) FAA oversight of inspections of shipments of mail and cargo by domestic and foreign air carriers; (2) the need for additional security measures with respect to such inspections; and (3) the adequacy of inspection and screening of cargo on passenger air carriers. Directs the President to submit relevant legislative proposals to the Congress. Requires the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to assure that FBI agents assigned to an area where there are high- risk airports carry out periodic threat and vulnerability assessments of security at least every three years at such airports. Requires the operator of each major airport to use dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement existing equipment used for screening passengers and cargo for plastic explosives and other devices or materials which may be used in aircraft piracy, subject to specified limitations. Directs the Administrator to initiate a rulemaking to revise Federal regulations regarding airplanes having fewer than 61 passenger seats to enhance safety and security of travel in such planes. (Sec. 110) Replaces a provision permitting grants to continue the program to detect explosives at airports and on aircraft with provisions directing the Secretary of Transportation to make grants for expenses of training and evaluation of dogs for the explosive detection K-9 team training program and extending such program to the largest 50 airports in the United States within 180 days of the enactment of the Aviation Security Improvement Act of 1996. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 112) Establishes the Civil Aviation Security Review Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of aviation security. Authorizes appropriations.

(Sec. 203) Urges the President to commence diplomatic efforts to establish a multilateral sanctions regime against nations certified under the Export Administration Act of 1979 as having repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. Requires the President to provide to: (1) the Congress an action plan for inducing such nations to cease their support for such acts; and (2) the House and Senate intelligence committees a report on the capability of the U.S intelligence community to detect, assess, and eliminate international terrorist activities. (Sec. 204) Directs: (1) the Secretary of State to designate, before October 1, 1996, foreign terrorist organizations pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996; (2) the Secretary of the Treasury, if possible, as justified by the evidence, and consistent with the needs of law enforcement and intelligence, to freeze assets; and (3) the Attorney General to initiate the removal of known alien terrorists and criminals. (Sec. 205) Requires the Director of the National Institute of Justice to: (1) contract for an independent study of the feasibility, safety, and law enforcement effectiveness of including taggants in black and smokeless powder; and (2) submit to the Congress recommendations for legislation for the addition of taggants to black and smokeless powder manufactured in or imported into the United States if specified conditions are met. (Sec. 206) Establishes the National Commission on Terrorism."
