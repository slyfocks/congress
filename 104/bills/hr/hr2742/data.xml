  <summary>12/7/1995--Introduced.
Makes available to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency a specified fraction of amounts in the Hazardous Substance Superfund for each fiscal year for a program of grants to States to be used for decontamination and remediation of brownfield sites to make such sites available for proposed new uses. Defines a "brownfield site" as a parcel of land that was previously used for industrial purposes but is contaminated with hazardous or toxic waste and not currently used for any purpose. Prohibits, with respect to a site at which decontamination or remediation is being carried out under an approved State brownfield cleanup program, any action for: (1) decontamination or remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) or the Solid Waste Disposal Act; and (2) recovery of costs or damages arising from a hazardous substance release or threatened release under CERCLA against a person who is engaging or has engaged in the cleanup of such a site under a State program approved under this Act. Imposes reporting requirements upon participating States.</summary>
