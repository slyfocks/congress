  <summary>3/21/1995--Introduced.
Technical Assistance Act of 1995 - Establishes within the Department of the Interior a National Heritage Areas Partnership Program to assist the Secretary of the Interior in: (1) evaluating areas nominated under this Act for designation as a national heritage area (area); and (2) advising State and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate entities regarding suitable methods of recognizing and conserving thematically and geographically linked natural, historic, and cultural resources and recreational opportunities. Outlines criteria for designation as an area, including the presence of: (1) a distinctive assemblage of natural, historic, or cultural resources; (2) unique traditions, customs, beliefs, or folklife; (3) methods of conserving such unique resources; and (4) recreational and educational opportunities. Allows an area to be so designated only by an act of Congress (which requires submission of a feasibility study, compact, and statement of approval to the Secretary). (Sec. 6) Requires each: (1) compact to include information relating to the objectives and management of an area proposed for designation; and (2) management plan to present comprehensive recommendations for the conservation, funding, management, and development of the area. Requires a management entity to develop and submit to the Secretary the management plan and to set priorities in the compact and management plan for the area. Provides that if a management plan is not submitted within three years after designation as an area, the area shall be ineligible for technical assistance under this Act. Allows an area with a timely management plan to receive technical assistance for a 13-year period beginning on the date of designation. Provides procedures for the withdrawal of such designation. (Sec. 9) Authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to units of government, Indian tribes, and private nonprofit organizations for feasibility studies, compacts, and, upon the request of a management entity, management plans and their implementation. Provides for oversight by the Secretary of areas with expired eligibility. (Sec. 12) Authorizes appropriations. Limits technical assistance to 75 percent of the cost of a study, compact, or plan. Limits total and annual funding for an area. Terminates the authorities contained in this Act on September 30 of the 15th fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 14) Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on the status of the Program as a whole.</summary>
