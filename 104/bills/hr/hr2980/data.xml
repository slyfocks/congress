  <summary>7/25/1996--Passed Senate amended.
Interstate Stalking Punishment and Prevention Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and prescribe penalties for interstate stalking (i.e., traveling across a State line or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States with the intent to injure or harass another person and, in the course or as a result of such travel, placing that person in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury to that person or a member of that person's immediate family). Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit: (1) the sale or disposal of a firearm or ammunition to any person who has been convicted of any crime involving domestic violence where the person has been represented by counsel or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel; and (2) such a person from possessing, transporting, or receiving a firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce. Mandates that the statement required for a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual contain a statement that the transferee is not such a person. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations providing for the effective receipt and secure storage of firearms relinquished by or seized from such persons.</summary>
