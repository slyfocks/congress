Amends the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to prohibit: (1) the sale or disposal of a firearm or ammunition to any person who has been convicted of any crime involving domestic violence where the person has been represented by counsel or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel; and (2) such a person from possessing, transporting, or receiving a firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce. Mandates that the statement required for a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer to sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual contain a statement that the transferee is not such a person. Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations providing for the effective receipt and secure storage of firearms relinquished by or seized from such persons."
