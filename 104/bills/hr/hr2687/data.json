    "text": "Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act of 1995 - Revises provisions regarding the National Automobile Title Information System (NATIS) to: (1) define \"motor vehicle\" to have the same meaning as \"passenger motor vehicle\"; and (2) redefine \"operator\" to mean the individual or entity authorized or designated as the operator of the NATIS, the National Stolen Passenger Motor Vehicle Information System (NSPMVIS), or the Attorney General. Makes the Attorney General (currently, the Secretary of Transportation) responsible for carrying out specified functions with respect to NATIS. Directs the Attorney General, no later than: (1) October 1, 1997, to establish a NATIS that will provide specified individuals and entities with instant and reliable access to information maintained by the States relating to motor vehicle titling; and (2) October 1, 1998, to report to the Congress on which States have met requirements with respect to NATIS. Grants immunity from any civil action seeking money damages or equitable relief in any Federal or State court for any person performing activities, in good faith and with the reasonable belief that such activities were in accordance with Federal provisions, relating to NATIS and NSPMVIS. Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to participating States to be used in making titling information available to the operator. Authorizes appropriations to carry out provisions regarding State participation in NATIS."
