    "text": "Fans Rights Act of 1995 - Declares that it shall not be unlawful by reason of any provision of the antitrust laws for a professional sports league to enforce rules authorizing the membership of the league to decide that a member club of such league shall not be relocated. Sets forth criteria for relocation decisions by leagues, including: (1) fan loyalty; (2) the extent to which the team received public financial support by means of any publicly financed playing facility, special tax treatment, or any other form of such support; (3) the adequacy of the stadium in which the team played its home games in the previous season, and the willingness of the stadium, arena authority, or local government to remedy any deficiencies in the facility; and (4) whether the team has incurred net operating losses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, sufficient to threaten the continued financial viability of the team. Requires any person seeking to change the home territory of a member team to furnish notice to all interested parties of the proposed change not later than 180 days before the commencement of the season in which the member team is to play in such other location. Sets forth notice requirements. Provides that, during the 180-day notice period, a local government, stadium, arena authority, person, or any combination thereof: (1) may prepare and present a proposal to purchase the member team to retain the team in the home territory; and (2) shall be given the opportunity to prepare and present such a proposal. Requires the response of the owner to any offer made to be in writing and delivered in person or by certified mail, stating in detail the reasons for refusal of any bona fide offer. Directs the league to make a determination with respect to the location of such member team's home territory before the expiration of the notice period, after conducting a hearing at which interested parties are afforded an opportunity to present testimony. Sets forth provisions regarding judicial review. Prohibits making or offering to make a payment, or to provide or arrange with others for the provision of other value, to a league or any of its members in connection with a decision regarding the relocation of a member team."
