Prohibits the importation into the United States of products produced by any sanctioned foreign person. Waives the requirements of this Act if the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that Iran has: (1) substantially improved its adherence to internationally recognized standards of human rights; (2) ceased its efforts to develop or acquire a nuclear explosive device, chemical or biological weapons, or missiles or related delivery systems; and (3) ceased support for acts of international terrorism. Sets forth additional criteria for such a waiver. Directs the President to establish a List of Petroleum and Natural Gas-Related Goods and Technology which shall be subject to the export control restrictions of this Act. Requires the President to report periodically to the appropriate congressional committees on Iran's: (1) nuclear and other military capabilities; and (2) support, if any, for acts of international terrorism."
