Establishes certain political and economic sanctions for Burma, both mandatory (including denial of unilateral assistance, action against multilateral assistance, and exclusion of certain Burmese nationals from admission into the United States) and discretionary (including travel to and tourism in Burma, restrictions on diplomatic representation from Burma, and withholding of certain funds from international financial institutions that fund activities in Burma), until the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that an elected government of Burma has been allowed to take power as result of the 1990 election or by new free and fair elections. Requires the Secretary of Labor to report to the appropriate congressional committees on Burma's unfair labor practices. Directs the Secretary of State to report to the appropriate congressional committees on: (1) Burma's exploitation of resources and degradation of its environment; and (2) a strategy to restore democracy to Burma."
