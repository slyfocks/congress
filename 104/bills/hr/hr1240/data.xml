  <summary>4/6/1995--Passed Senate amended.
Sex Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995 - Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to increase the base offense level: (1) by at least two levels for offenses involving the creation of, or trafficking in, child pornography; (2) by at least two levels if a computer was used to traffic in, or advertise, child pornography; and (3) by at least three levels for an offense involving the interstate transportation of children with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Directs the Commission to submit a report to the Congress concerning offenses involving child pornography and other sex offenses against children, including: (1) an analysis of the sentences imposed for specified sex offenses and recommendations as to any modifications to the sentencing guidelines; (2) an analysis (and recommendations regarding modification) of the sentences for other specified offenses where the victim was under age 18; (3) an analysis of the type of substantial assistance that courts have recognized as warranting a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines for specified child pornography offenses; and (4) a survey of the recidivism rate for offenders convicted of committing sexual crimes against children, an analysis of the impact on recidivism of sexual abuse treatment provided during or after incarceration, and an analysis of whether increased penalties would reduce recidivism for those crimes.</summary>
