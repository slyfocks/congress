  <summary>10/3/1996--Passed Senate amended.
Amends the Federal judicial code to provide that, for purposes of compensating an owner of a patent for an invention that is used or manufactured unlawfully by or for the United States, reasonable and entire compensation shall include the owner's reasonable costs, including reasonable fees for expert witnesses and attorneys, in pursuing action against the United States in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims if the owner is an independent inventor, a nonprofit organization, or an entity that had no more than 500 employees at any time during the five-year period preceding such use or manufacture. Provides that reasonable and entire compensation shall not include such costs and fees if the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances made an award unjust unless the action has been pending for more than ten years from the time of filing to the time that the owner applies for such costs and fees.</summary>
