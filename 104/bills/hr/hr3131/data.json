Authorizes the Secretary to approve an eligible agency's application to impose a passenger facility fee to finance an airport- related project located within five miles of a State boundary only if, among other things, the eligible agency has complied with the requirements of this Act to the same extent as an airport development project sponsor is required to comply."
