Directs the Secretary of State to designate an individual from the diplomatic mission in Khartoum, Sudan, for monitoring slavery there. Requires the President to report to the Congress on all forms of covert and overt forms of slavery in Sudan. Directs the President to instruct: (1) the U.S. representative to each international financial institution to oppose any assistance to Sudan until it has taken action to eliminate chattel slavery; and (2) the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations to pursue passage of any U.N. Security Council resolution that enhances cooperation of other countries in applying sanctions against Sudan. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should work with foreign countries and appropriate international organizations to ensure that humanitarian assistance organizations have access to all parts of Sudan for the purpose of assisting individuals who have been enslaved to resettle in Sudan."
