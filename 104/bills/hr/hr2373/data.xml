  <summary>09/21/1995--Introduced.
Prohibits the President, the Vice President, or a Member of Congress from receiving basic pay for any period in which: (1) there is a lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution; or (2) the Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached. Provides that no pay forfeited in accordance with this Act may be paid retroactively.</summary>
