Permits use of snowmobiles on and recreational fishing within such major and interior lakes. Requires the Secretary to: (1) study and report to the Congress on the cost of constructing and maintaining additional cross-country ski routes, snowmobile trails, hiking trails, camp sites, and overnight ski huts to allow access to, and use of, the lakes; (2) authorize at least 200 houseboats to operate within the Park; (3) submit to the Congress a management plan for the Park; (4) study and report to the Congress on a comparison of the recreational developments and beneficial economic impacts that were expected to those that occurred following the establishment of the Park.
