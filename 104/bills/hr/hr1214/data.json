(Sec. 101) Prohibits such assistance, generally, to: (1) certain aliens; (2) families without a minor child; (3) families not cooperating in paternity establishment or child support; (4) children born out-of-wedlock to a minor parent (or the parent until such parent turns age 18); (5) families not assigning support rights to the State; (6) minor children born to benefit recipients; and (7) a person convicted of fraudulently misrepresenting residence in order to receive welfare benefits. Withholds a portion of assistance for families which include a child whose paternity is not established. Provides that in order to be eligible for block grants under such program a State must submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services a plan that includes: (1) an outline of the assistance the State intends on providing to needy families with children; and (2) certifications that the State will operate revised SSA title IV part B (Child-Welfare Services) and D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) programs in accordance with this Act. Allows States to use grants for: (1) providing low-income household heating and cooling assistance; (2) implementing an electronic benefit transfer system for providing assistance to needy families with children; and (3) carrying out a State program pursuant to specified provisions of Federal law, including the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990. Gives States the authority to treat families moving interstate under the former State program rules if they reside in their new State of residence for less than 12 months. Increases the amount of such grants for States which have reduced their out-of-wedlock births. Sets out penalties for violations of grant uses and mandatory work requirements. Establishes in the Treasury a revolving loan fund known as the Federal Rainy Day Fund for making loans to, and receiving payments of principal and interest on such loans from, qualified States under the new State block grant program. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the States should require noncustodial, nonsupporting parents who have not attained 18 years of age to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school; and (2) each State that operates a block grant program is encouraged to assign the highest priority to requiring families that include older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in work activities. Directs the Secretary to: (1) research the costs and benefits of State activities under this title; (2) evaluate innovative approaches to employing program recipients; (3) rank States in order of their success under the grant program; and (4) review the most and least successful State work programs. Sets forth requirements for: (1) State data collection and reporting; and (2) a Census Bureau study obtaining information for evaluating the impact of this title on a random national sample of recipients of assistance under State block grant programs. Appropriates funds for the latter. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) conduct research on the effects, costs, and benefits of State block grant programs under this title; (2) assist States in development and evaluation of innovative approaches to employing welfare recipients; and (3) conduct studies of the caseloads of States operating programs under this title. Directs the Secretary to develop innovative methods of disseminating information on any research, evaluations, and studies conducted under this title. (Sec. 102) Directs the Secretary to report to the Congress on automated data processing systems under State block grant programs and the modifications necessary for tracking public program participants and checking case records to prohibit participants from participating in public programs of two or more States. (Sec. 106) Provides for the continued application of current AFDC standards under the Medicaid program under SSA title XIX. Title II: Child Protection Block Grant Program - Revises SSA title IV part B's Child-Welfare Services program, converting it also into a program of block grants to the States, in this case, for the protection of children in accordance with specified standards. (Sec. 201) Sets forth requirements, similar to those in title I, pertaining to: (1) State eligibility plans with appropriate certifications; (2) grant uses; (3) penalties; (4) data collection and reporting; (5) research; (6) a national random sample study; and (7) continued application of current standards under the Medicaid program. Adds requirements for: (1) citizen review panels for examining specific cases to ensure that State and local agencies are doing their job properly to protect children; (2) a clearinghouse and telephone hotline on missing and runaway children; (3) decreasing the time children wait for adoption; and (4) preventing discrimination in multiethnic placements of children. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Block Grants For Child Care And For Nutrition Assistance - Subtitle A: Child Care Block Grants - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to add the following as goals for such Act: (1) to allow each State maximum flexibility in developing child care programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within such State; (2) to promote parental choice to empower working parents to make their own decisions on the child care that best suits their family's needs; (3) to encourage States to provide consumer education information to help parents make informed choices about child care; (4) to assist States to provide child care to parents trying to achieve independence from public assistance; and (5) to assist States in implementing the health, safety, licensing, and registration standards established in State regulations. (Sec. 301) Reauthorizes and extends such Act through 2000. Makes various specified technical and other changes to the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 with regard to lead State agency designation, State application and plan, and limitations on State allotments. Repeals earmarked required expenditures. Requires each State to report a plan for annual evaluations of the extent to which the State has achieved each goal established by this Act. Authorizes a State to transfer funds to carry out other State programs operated under specified provisions of Federal law, including State Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and Child-Welfare Services programs. (Sec. 302) Repeals certain child care assistance authorized by specified Acts other than the Social Security Act, including Native Hawaiian Family-Based Education Centers under the Native Hawaiian Education Act. Subtitle B: Family and School-Based Nutrition Block Grants - Revises the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, among other changes, converting the current child nutrition program under that Act into a State family nutrition block grant program with goals that include the following: (1) to provide nutritional risk assessment, food assistance based on such risk assessment, and nutrition education and counseling to economically disadvantaged pregnant women, postpartum women, breastfeeding women, infants, and young children at nutritional risk; and (2) to provide food assistance, including nutritious meal supplements, to such women in order to reduce incidences of low-birthweight babies and babies born with birth defects as a result of nutritional deficiencies. (Sec. 321) Sets forth the formula for allotting appropriations among the States. Specifies the use of grant amounts, and establishes penalties for misuse of funds. Requires the appropriate State agency to determine that sufficient grant amounts will remain available during a fiscal year to carry out this subtitle before using any such amounts for the fiscal year. Sets out State reporting requirements. Directs the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to develop, and report to specified congressional committees, model nutrition standards for food assistance provided to economically disadvantaged pregnant women, postpartum women, breastfeeding women, infants, and young children. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 341) Amends the National School Lunch Act, among other changes, converting the current school lunch program into a program of school-based nutrition block grants to States to provide assistance to schools to establish and carry out nutritious food service programs that provide affordable meals and supplements to students. Requires the appropriate State agency to determine that sufficient grant amounts will remain available during a fiscal year to carry out this subtitle before using any such amounts for the fiscal year. Prohibits a State from requiring a school district, private nonprofit school, of Department of Defense domestic dependents' school to accept commodities, except on request, for use in its food service program. Directs the States to ensure that schools provided State assistance in establishing and carrying out nutritious food service programs do not: (1) physically segregate children eligible to receive free or low cost meals or supplements on the basis of such eligibility; (2) provide for overt identification of such children by special means; or (3) otherwise discriminate against them.
