Directs the Commission to establish: (1) one preliminary debate; (2) not more than two vice presidential debates; and (3) not less than two or more than four presidential debates. Authorizes appropriations to each Commission appointed such sums as may be necessary to carry out its activities with respect to the election involved. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce the amount of Federal payments for a party's nominating convention for the following general election if the party's nominee for President or Vice President does not certify to the Presidential Debate Commission that the nominee will participate in all applicable Commission debates (other than a preliminary debate)."
