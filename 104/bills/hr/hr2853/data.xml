  <summary>1/5/1996--Introduced.
Notes that the U.S. Trade Representative intends to negotiate with Bulgaria in order to preserve the commitments of that country under the bilateral commercial agreement in effect between that country and the United States that are consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization. Authorizes the President to: (1) determine that title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (denying nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of certain countries) should no longer apply to Bulgaria; and (2) based upon such determination, extend nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to Bulgaria's products.</summary>
