(Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs under parts A and F, respectively, of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a single, combined program of block grants to the States for operating statewide temporary assistance (TANF) programs with certain mandatory work (subsidized or unsubsidized, public or private), employment-related education, and job training, search, and other job-related activities (required program activities) for eligible families, which are designed to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and assist such families in forming, staying together, and ultimately becoming self-sufficient in private sector employment. Limits such families generally to no more than five years of TANF cash assistance, with certain exceptions for minor children, battered family members, and hardship situations. Requires participating States to provide vouchers to families denied cash assistance due to any other State-imposed time limits. Mandates that families include either a minor child who resides with a custodial parent or other adult caretaker relative or a pregnant individual in order to be eligible for TANF assistance. Requires, in addition, certain adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents and the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent if they did not complete a high school education. Prohibits (unless a State opts otherwise) additional TANF cash assistance for children born into families already on TANF, with certain exceptions for: (1) children born into families with no other children; (2) vouchers provided in lieu of cash benefits that are only good for State-specified goods and services suitable for child care in the particular case; and (3) children born as a result of rape or incest. Denies TANF in cases where an individual family member is a fugitive felon or a probation or parole violator, and suspends it for ten years for individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain TANF assistance in two or more States. Requires States not disregard benefits an individual receives under a State old-age, foster care, or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) plan under SSA title XVI when determining the amount of TANF for the family of which the individual is a member. Specifies State TANF plan contents, including provisions for numeric goals for reducing illegitimacy in the State over a specified period beginning in 1996, and certain certifications by the State that it will operate child support enforcement and protection programs. Includes among criteria for Federal approval of a State program under TANF requirements for a parent or caretaker receiving TANF to engage in State-defined work once the State determines the parent or caretaker is ready to engage in work, or once the parent or caretaker has received assistance under TANF for 24 months (whether or not consecutive), whichever is earlier. Allows the States to decide in their TANF plans: (1) whether or not they intend on providing TANF to aliens; and (2) how to treat families moving interstate, while allowing them to treat such families under the rules of their former State of residence only under certain conditions. Requires a plan to contain an estimate of the number of individuals (if any) who will become ineligible for State Medicaid assistance as a result of eligibility rules changes for the new TANF-funded State program, and requires the plan to indicate the extent to which the State will provide medical assistance to such individuals. Provides for the allowable uses of quarterly family assistance grants, among other purposes, for family planning services, child care under certain State block grant programs, and meeting home heating and cooling costs of certain low income households; but prohibits their use for medical services generally. Provides for: (1) additional grants to States for reductions in illegitimate births, population increases, and State work, education, and job preparation programs; and (2) a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs in the Treasury for payments to eligible States. Makes applicable appropriations. Sets up a Federal loan program for State TANF programs for anti-fraud and other specified activities, making necessary appropriations. Provides for the exchange of certain TANF program information with law enforcement agencies under specified conditions. Details the required activities under State TANF programs for assisting participant families in achieving self-sufficiency, including participation in community service programs and vocational educational training, along with certain special rules such as those limiting the number of families which may engage in vocational educational activities. Requires the applicable State agency responsible for administering the TANF program to make an initial assessment of the TANF recipient's skills, prior work experience, and employability and develop an individual responsibility plan based on such assessment in which the recipient agrees to satisfy certain obligations in return for the State's provision of certain services to enable the recipient to obtain and keep employment in the private sector. Establishes penalties for States and individual families for specified grant and program violations through reduced grants and assistance payments, respectively, even allowing States to terminate such payments to certain adult family members who refuse to: (1) engage in required program activities; or (2) cooperate with the State in establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support order. Provides for a separate reduction in State family assistance grant payments for States failing to comply with Federal requirements under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) pertaining to paternity establishment and child support enforcement. Expresses the sense of the Congress that State TANF programs should: (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in required program activities; and (2) require noncustodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. Sets forth the mechanism for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State TANF plans or imposition of penalties, providing for advance notification of any program violation and the opportunity for a State to correct it before any such penalty is imposed. Limits the amount of any penalty reduction in the State's quarterly family assistance grant payment. Provides for direct funding, by way of three-year tribal family assistance grants, to Indian tribes (with a special rule for Indian tribes in Alaska) with approved plans for administering their own welfare programs with similar work requirements and time limits for receipt of assistance. Makes necessary appropriations. Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation to obtain information that will enable interested persons to evaluate the impact of the changes made by this title on a random national sample of recipients of assistance under State TANF programs and, as appropriate, on other low income families. Provides for the treatment of existing State AFDC (welfare reform) waiver projects in effect when this Act is enacted and those granted subsequently. Retains the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Family Support as the official responsible for administering TANF programs. Outlines various specified program data collection and reporting requirements, as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements. Allows for demonstrations of innovative approaches for reducing welfare dependency and increasing the well-being of minor children. Requires certain annual State rankings by the HHS Secretary according their successes in placing TANF recipients into long-term private sector jobs and reducing out-of-wedlock births. Makes applicable appropriations. (Sec. 104) Allows States to contract with charitable, religious, and private organizations to provide services and administer programs established or modified under titles I, II, and VI of this Act. Prohibits the expenditure of financial assistance for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expand census data collection efforts to enable the Bureau of the Census to collect statistically significant data on grandparent caregivers. (Sec. 106) Requires an HHS report to the Congress on State automated data processing systems used in administering TANF programs to determine what would be required to establish a system for tracking public program participants and checking case records to determine if they are participating in public programs of two or more States. (Sec. 107) Details requirements for a similar report, and study, on alternative outcomes measures for evaluating the success of the States in moving individuals off welfare through employment. (Sec. 108) Makes applicable conforming amendments to SSA (including SSA title XI with regard to additional grants for Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa), the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and related provisions of other specified Federal laws, as well as to the Internal Revenue Code with regard to the collection of overpayments under the TANF program. (Sec. 111) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) to: (1) develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant social security card; and (2) study and report to the Congress on improving the social security card application process. (Sec. 112) Requires any organization accepting Federal funds under this title or any amendments made by it to disclose that fact in any communication it makes that in any way intends to promote public support or opposition to any Federal, State, or local government policy through any broadcasting station, periodical, or other specified type of general public advertising. Makes any organization failing to make such a disclosure ineligible to receive Federal funds under this Act. (Sec. 113) Amends the Family Support Act of 1988 to remove the "demonstration" status of the Job Opportunities for Certain Low-Income Individuals (JOLI) program and give it an increased annual authorization. (Sec. 115) Provides for the application of certain former AFDC standards and methodologies under the Medicaid program, such as those for determining income and resources, as well as those under TANF which are current. Title II: Supplemental Security Income - Subtitle A: Eligibility Restrictions - Amends SSA title XVI to: (1) deny SSI by reason of disability to drug addicts and alcoholics for whom addiction or alcoholism would be a contributing factor material to the disability determination; (2) revise representative payee and treatment requirements; (3) suspend SSI benefits for ten years to individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain SSI or other benefits simultaneously in two or more States; (4) deny SSI benefits for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators; and (5) outline the process for periodic review with respect to the continuing eligibility of an individual 18 years of age or older to receive certain SSI disability benefits. (Sec. 204) Revises the treatment afforded prisoners with regard to SSI and Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits to: (1) deny SSI benefits for ten years to a person found to have fraudulently obtained SSI benefits while in prison; (2) eliminate the OASDI requirement that confinement stem from a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year; and (3) authorize the Commissioner to contract with any interested State or local institutions used to confine prisoners for monthly reports of certain identifying information in order to enforce SSI and OASDI benefit limitations, and pay such institution a specified fee with regard to each SSI- or OASDI-eligible inmate identified who becomes ineligible for such benefit as a result of such reporting. Requires the Commissioner to study and report to the Congress on other specified potential improvements in the collection of information respecting public inmates.
