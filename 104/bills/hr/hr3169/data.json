    "text": "Job Corps Improvement Act of 1996 - Amends the Job Training Partnership Act with respect to the Job Corps program. Directs the Secretary of Labor to require that Job Corps applicants be tested for drug and alcohol use and undergo appropriate background checks. Directs the Secretary to establish Job Corps standards of conduct that prohibit enrollee possession, distribution, or use of controlled substances, abuse of alcohol, acts of violence, and other related disruptive activities. Requires the director of a Job Corps center to take appropriate disciplinary measures against an enrollee, including immediate dismissal, upon determination that the enrollee has violated any such standard. Subjects such dismissal decisions by directors to expeditious appeal procedures established by the Secretary. Limits the portion of Job Corps funds which may be used for program administration. Directs the Secretary to: (1) review and report to the Congress on Job Corps activities; and (2) make improvements, based on review results, in the operation of the Job Corps program, including specified numbers of closings and relocations of centers. Prohibits closing a Job Corps center if it is the only one in a State or a region. Allows completion of planning or construction and beginning of operation of any uncompleted Job Corps center that received Federal funding for FY 1994 or 1995. Prohibits the Secretary from evaluating any such center sooner than three years after the first date of operation. Directs the Secretary to report biennially to the Congress on specified matters relating to the Job Corps program."
