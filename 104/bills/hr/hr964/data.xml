  <summary>2/15/1995--Introduced.
Multiple Handgun Transfer Prohibition Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit: (1) a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer from transferring two or more handguns to an individual not so licensed during any 30-day period or from transferring a handgun to any such individual who received a handgun during the previous 30-day period; and (2) any individual who is not so licensed from receiving two or more handguns during any 30-day period. Makes such prohibitions inapplicable with respect to any individual who has presented to the transferor a written statement, issued by the chief law enforcement officer of the individual's place of residence during the preceding ten days that the individual requires access to a handgun because of a threat to his or her life or household. Sets forth: (1) reporting and recordkeeping requirements; and (2) penalties for knowing violations of this Act.</summary>
