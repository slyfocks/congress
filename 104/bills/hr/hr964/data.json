Makes such prohibitions inapplicable with respect to any individual who has presented to the transferor a written statement, issued by the chief law enforcement officer of the individual's place of residence during the preceding ten days that the individual requires access to a handgun because of a threat to his or her life or household. Sets forth: (1) reporting and recordkeeping requirements; and (2) penalties for knowing violations of this Act."
