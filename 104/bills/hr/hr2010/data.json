Eliminates deficiency payments and marketing loans for such crops beginning with crop year 2001. Eliminates acreage reduction programs and 0-85 and 50-85 programs beginning with crop year 1999. Amends the Food Security Act of 1985 to: (1) impose specified income limitations on price support program participation; and (2) reduce producer deficiency and acreage diversion payments. Sets forth Commodity Credit Corporation deficiency payment budgetary limitations. Expresses the sense of the Congress against the use of U.S. agricultural commodities in trade embargoes, except for cases of state-supported terrorism. Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report on the feasibility of agricultural producer private revenue insurance."
