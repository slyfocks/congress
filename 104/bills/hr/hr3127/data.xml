  <summary>3/20/1996--Introduced.
Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1996 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to dispose of certain Federal lands within the area under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Bureau of Land Management in Clark County, Nevada. Allows a unit of local government in whose jurisdiction the lands are located (Clark County, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, or Henderson, Nevada) to elect to obtain, without consideration, up to 12 percent of the lands for local public purposes. Sets forth provisions concerning: (1) withdrawal of such lands from mining laws and from operation under the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws; and (2) joint selection of such lands for sale or exchange by the Secretary and the respective unit of local government. Provides for allocation of proceeds from the land sales and exchanges to: (1) the general education program of Nevada; (2) the Southern Nevada Water Authority; (3) Clark County, Nevada, for development of parks and trails and for public recreation purpose; and (4) a special account in the Treasury for direct payments where lands are exchanged under this Act and for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land in Nevada and for infrastructure needs associated with recreation and resource protection programs in Federal areas in Clark County. Requires the Secretary to transfer the airport environs overlay district lands identified in the Interim Cooperative Management Agreement between the United States Department of the Interior-Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, dated November 4, 1992, to Clark County upon request, without consideration, and subject to specified conditions. (Sec. 5) Allows the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to acquire environmentally sensitive land with the owner's consent. Provides that such acquired land that is within the boundaries of a unit of the National Forest System, the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Trails System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or any other system or national conservation or recreation area established by Act of Congress shall: (1) become part of the unit or area without further action by the respective Secretary; and (2) be managed in accordance with all laws and regulations and land use plans applicable to the unit or area. States that nothing in this Act or any other shall be construed to constitute Federal reservation of water or water rights for any purpose arising from the acquisition of lands or interests in lands. Includes lands acquired by the Secretaries under this Act within the definition of entitlement lands with respect to Federal payments to a local unit of government in which such land is located (payments in lieu of taxes). (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary, upon request by a grantee of lands within Clark County, Nevada, that are subject to a lease or patent issued under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act (RPPA) or a unit of local government making an election to obtain land for local public purposes under this Act, to enter into an exchange of lands on an equal value basis. Requires the Secretary: (1) to make land available under the RPPA to the Southern Nevada Water Authority; and (2) in consultation with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Clark County Nevada Regional Flood Control District in Nevada, to make land available to the District, in accordance with the RPPA, for flood control purposes. (Sec. 8) Amends the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area Establishment Act of 1990 to modify the boundaries of the Area.</summary>
