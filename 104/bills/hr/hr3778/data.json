Sets forth State and local application requirements. Requires a State, to be eligible to receive funds, to develop or maintain programs of urinalysis or similar drug testing of individuals upon arrest and on a regular basis pending trial for the purpose of making pretrial detention decisions. Provides for the allocation and distribution of funds. Limits the Federal share to 75 percent of total project costs. Authorizes appropriations."
