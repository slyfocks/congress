  <summary>10/11/1995--Introduced.
Federal Land Exchange Improvement Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to increase the value of public land available for "approximately equal value" exchanges out of Federal ownership. Requires: (1) funds received by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to be deposited in a special land exchange Treasury fund, subject to a monetary ceiling (excess amounts to go into Treasury miscellaneous receipts); and (2) certain environmental and endangered species related activities as part of the exchange process. Exempts public or National Forest System lands minor boundary adjustment exchanges from equal value requirements. Amends Federal law to eliminate the exchange restriction on Oregon and California railroad grant lands. Amends Federal law to permit National Forest land exchanges for public school purposes only if the land was in use during the five-year period ending on the date of conveyance. (Current law permits exchange if in use as of January 12, 1983.) Amends the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act to waive the public use requirement for exchanges under such Act.</summary>
