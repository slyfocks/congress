Provides for the suspension of that prohibition on the enactment of a joint resolution declaring a national emergency. Declares that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, an increase in the public debt limit shall not be effective if it makes the limit greater than: (1) $5.432 trillion between October 1, 1997, and September 30, 1999; or (2) $5.908 trillion after September 30, 1999.</summary>
