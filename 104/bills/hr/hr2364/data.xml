  <summary>9/19/1995--Introduced.
Endangered Species Recovery and Conservation Incentive Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of the Interior, within two years after the listing of an animal or plant as endangered under this Act, to develop a plan for the conservation or recovery of the endangered species, or upon finding that such a plan will not promote the conservation or recovery of such species, to develop a conservation or recovery statement. Requires the Secretary: (1) in developing and implementing the plans, to give priority to those endangered species that are most likely to benefit; and to those endangered species that are more genetically complex, taxonomically unique or ecologically, medicinally, or economically valuable; and (2) to give priority to the latter with respect to developing statements. Requires each such plan or statement to include: (1) site-specific conservation or recovery actions; (2) criteria for removal from the endangered species list; (3) time estimates for carrying out measures; (4) species population goals and current population estimates; (5) social and economic benefits of species conservation; and (6) a description and the status of animals of the same species or sub-genus. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures for making the draft of a plan or statement available for public comment; (2) approval of the plan or statement; (3) public notification of such approval; (4) amendment of the plan; (5) outside assistance for the development of a plan or statement; and (6) applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to recovery teams. Allows the Secretary, upon determining that it will contribute to the conservation or recovery of an endangered species, to provide scientific, technical, administrative, or financial assistance to private, State, or lesser government entities to: (1) establish voluntary agreements with non-Federal land owners for up to 25 years to improve, maintain, or create habitat for endangered species; (2) promote conservation through commerce by providing assistance to, entering into agreements with, or otherwise encouraging for-profit and not-for-profit companies, organizations, and individuals involved in such activities; (3) acquire property from willing sellers; and (4) take other nonregulatory conservation or recovery measures. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a system of awards and rewards for participation in voluntary and cooperative programs that further the conservation or recovery of endangered species; and (2) maintain a public database of information valuable to the conservation of endangered species. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative agreement with any State that is designed to directly further the management of endangered species or their habitat and thereby promote the conservation or recovery of such endangered species through the provision of scientific, technical, or managerial assistance or through the provision of contracts. Allows the Secretary to provide scientific, technical, or administrative assistance to other Federal agencies to promote the conservation or recovery of endangered species. Requires the Secretary to: (1) assess whether major Federal projects will directly and significantly reduce the likelihood that an endangered species may be conserved or recovered; and (2) transmit such findings to the Federal agencies conducting the projects and to the Congress. Defines, for purposes of this Act, "major Federal project" to mean any individual Federal undertaking, permit, or license directly resulting in a Federal expenditure of more than $2 million. Authorizes the Secretary to bring an action to enjoin any activity which the Secretary can reasonably demonstrate to destroy an endangered species or its habitat and to bring one additional action to enjoin such activity if attempts, during the injunction, to negotiate a voluntary conservation agreement with the property owner are unsuccessful. Sets forth provisions governing: (1) limitations on such injunctions; (2) orders to enter a property to capture or collect and remove endangered species that otherwise face imminent damage or destruction; (3) U.S. liability for all damages and losses incurred by a property owner resulting from such entry; (4) acquisition of property pursuant to this Act; and (5) a requirement for the Secretary to monitor the success of voluntary agreements and other voluntary efforts under this Act in conserving and recovering endangered species. (Sec. 5) Requires the Secretary to determine whether any animal or plant is endangered based on: (1) the present or imminent destruction, adverse modification, or curtailment of a significant portion of its habitat or range; (2) disease or predation; (3) an extremely limited range or population; (4) other adequate and verifiable scientifically valid data indicating natural or manmade factors adversely affecting the species' continued existence. Allows the Secretary of Commerce to recommend to the Secretary of the Interior that an animal or plant is endangered and that it should be enumerated in, or removed from, the list of endangered species published under this Act. Requires such action to be implemented if the Secretary of the Interior concurs. Prohibits inclusion of an animal or plant in such list or its removal from the list without a prior favorable determination made by the Secretary of Commerce. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the procedures and requirements for determining whether an animal or plant should be included in, or removed from, the list; (2) an emergency listing of animals or plants determined to be in danger of imminent extinction; (3) the effectiveness of such determination for up to one year; (4) a one time renewal of such emergency listing; (5) termination of the effectiveness of such emergency determination after the date of its publication in the Federal Register; and (6) the establishment of an emergency listing. Requires the Secretary of the Interior, within one year of determining that an animal or plant is endangered, to determine whether recovery is a feasible goal for the endangered species and to publish such determination and the basis for it in the Federal Register. Requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register and make available to the public through electronic means a list of every animal and plant for which there is in effect a determination by the Secretary or the Secretary of Commerce that the animal or plant is endangered. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) petitions for judicial review by persons who may be directly and substantially affected by actions taken or determination or finding pursuant to this Act; (2) court standards in reviewing such petitions; and (3) the definition of "substantial evidence" when applicable to any act or determination under this Act which is reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. Requires the Secretary to implement a system, in cooperation with the States, to monitor effectively for at least five years the status of all animals and plants which: (1) have recovered to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary; and (2) have been removed from the list. Requires the Secretary to report biennially to the President and to the Congress on efforts to conserve and recover endangered species. (Sec. 6) Sets forth civil or criminal penalties for: (1) directly and intentionally killing or physically injuring a member of any vertebrate species which is properly included in the list, except that uses of endangered species such as hunting, fishing, captive propagation, and harvesting that contribute to the endangered animal's survival or conservation shall be allowed; (2) knowingly and intentionally violating an injunction or order issued pursuant to this Act; (3) in knowing violation of this Act, maliciously and in the pursuit of personal gain as a direct result thereof, intentionally killing or directly and intentionally physically injuring a member of a vertebrate species which is properly included in the published list or a member of an endangered species while trespassing on private property or while in a National Park or National Wildlife Refuge. Sets forth civil penalties for intentionally capturing, collecting, or trapping, and for directly and intentionally killing or directly and intentionally physically insuring, any listed vertebrate animal or plant on any property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, while trespassing on private property, or while on federally owned lands within a National Park and National Wildlife Refuge. Sets forth provisions: (1) prohibiting penalties from being imposed upon a defendant, under certain conditions, who was acting to protect himself or herself or other individuals from bodily harm or to protect private property from significant damage; and (2) specifying as a defense against charges brought under this Act that the defendant had the owner's consent and the animal or plant was owned before the date of inclusion of its taxonomic unit on the list or that it was the progeny of such animal or plant or was otherwise lawfully acquired. Allows the Secretary to waive the violations in this Act to protect public health and safety or for national security or a national, regional, or local emergency. Directs the Secretary, under certain conditions, to permit persons or States to commit actions to contribute to furthering the conservation of an endangered species. (Sec. 7) Directs Federal departments and agencies to conserve or recover endangered species on Federal lands and, with the owner's consent, on State and private lands and to utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this Act. Requires Federal agencies to cooperate with State and local agencies to resolve water resource issues in concert with conservation or recovery of endangered animals and plants in a manner consistent with, and governed by, State water law. Prohibits water rights protected under State law from being injured or adversely affected in carrying out this Act without just compensation. Provides that this Act shall not be construed so as to modify the allocation of water among or between States pursuant to either interstate compacts or decisions of the United States Supreme Court. Requires the Secretary to make the following information available by electronic means such as Internet and to seek to make access to such information available at minimal cost and inconvenience to those seeking the information: (1) notices issued by the Secretary under this Act that would appear in the Federal Register or other forums of public notice; (2) recovery or conservation plans and statements; (3) the list; (4) the biennial report to the President and to the Congress; and (5) other materials received regarding or produced in implementing this Act. (Sec. 8) Establishes the Endangered Species Recovery Fund in the Treasury to be made available to the Secretary to carry out this Act. Provides that nothing in this Act authorizes the Secretary, except with respect to federally designated wilderness areas, to: (1) establish or impose any user or admission fees for lands for which such a fee is not in effect on this Act's enactment; (2) increase that portion of any user or admission fee which shall be directed to the Fund by more than one dollar; or (3) direct any more than that amount from such fee to the Fund. Requires the Secretary to establish and issue to individuals a Lifetime User Pass for a fee not to exceed $500 which shall permit such individual to enter National Parks, National Wildlife Refuges, National Recreation Areas, National Seashores, National Lakeshores, or National Monuments. Allows the Secretary to accept donations from the public to carry out this Act, with the exception of donations from persons having business with, or matters pending before, the Secretary's department. (Sec. 9) Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) a 100 percent property tax credit for private property or a portion thereof that is managed to promote the conservation or recovery of an endangered species by providing habitat which is used or occupied by an endangered species; and (2) a credit of up to 100 percent for expenditures for furthering the conservation or recovery of an endangered species pursuant to an agreement entered into with the Secretary under this Act. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to undertake activities to further the conservation or recovery of endangered species by the collection, storing, and use of: (1) genetic materials, eggs, sperm, or tissue of endangered animals; and (2) genetic material, seeds, or tissue of endangered plants. (Sec. 11) Amends the Endangered Species Act (the Act) to define "harm" for purposes of such Act to mean an intentional and direct action that injures or kills any member of an endangered or threatened species of fish or wildlife other than as an unintended consequence of otherwise lawful activity. Prohibits an action permitting activity on private property from being subject to the requirements or procedures outlined in such Act. Prohibits the Secretary from taking actions under the Act to determine endangered and threatened species and to designate critical habitat. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) inclusion of, or removal from, the list of species determined to be endangered or threatened pursuant to the Act; and (2) compensation to a owner of property whose use of any portion of that property has been limited by an action taken after this Act's enactment that diminishes the fair market value of such portion by 20 percent or more. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
