Sets forth conditions on payment of surcharges to recipient organizations. Repeals the requirement that the Comptroller General submit a financial accounting statement to the Congress on the payment of surcharges and on the use and expenditure of surcharge proceeds by a recipient organization. (Sec. 102) Decreases from five years to four years the terms of office for members of the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee ( the Committee). Mandates that the Chairperson of such Committee be elected by its members from among such members. Requires the Committee to report to the Congress on recommendations for development of a multiyear commemorative coin program involving circulating coins which would supersede other commemorative coin programs for the year the commemorative circulating coin program is in effect. Title II: Platinum and Gold Bullion Coins - Authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) mint and issue platinum bullion coins; and (2) continue to mint and issue American Eagle gold coins in two or more versions simultaneously. Title III: Mint Managerial Staffing Reform - Amends Federal law to repeal the requirement that each mint have a presidentially appointed superintendent and assayer and the Philadelphia mint have a presidentially appointed engraver."
