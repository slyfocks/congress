  <summary>1/17/1995--Introduced.
Airfare Advertising Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Trade Commission Act to direct the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent domestic and foreign air carriers from disseminating false, misleading, or deceptive advertisements. Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from taking action with respect to deceptive advertisements committed by such carriers if such violation also constitutes a violation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and this Act. Requires the FTC to issue a final rule which at least requires: (1) disclosure of restrictions; (2) inclusion of other costs of transportation in the advertised rate; and (3) disclosure of the number of seats involved.</summary>
