Amends Federal transportation law to prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from taking action with respect to deceptive advertisements committed by such carriers if such violation also constitutes a violation under the Federal Trade Commission Act and this Act. Requires the FTC to issue a final rule which at least requires: (1) disclosure of restrictions; (2) inclusion of other costs of transportation in the advertised rate; and (3) disclosure of the number of seats involved."
