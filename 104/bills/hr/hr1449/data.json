Considers the Preserve a designated unit of the National Park System, including for purposes of charging entrance and admission fees under specified provisions of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees a general management plan for the Preserve. Authorizes the acquisition of real property and improvements thereon, and rights-of-way on roads that are not owned by Kansas, within the boundaries of the Preserve. Sets forth provisions regarding payments to local governments in lieu of taxes for such real property. Prohibits: (1) such property from being acquired without the owner's consent; and (2) U.S. acquisition of fee ownership of any lands within the Preserve other than these lands. Establishes the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Advisory Committee to advise the Secretary and the Director of the National Park Service on the development, management, and interpretation of the Preserve. Authorizes appropriations."
