    "text": "International Counterfeiting Prevention Act of 1996 - Requires the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Secretary of State to establish, and appoint the members of, an interagency task force to: (1) monitor the use and holding of U.S. currency in foreign countries; (2) produce a statistically valid estimate of the amount of counterfeit U.S. currency that is produced, passed, and possessed outside the United States each year; and (3) coordinate the activities of the agencies represented on the task force in carrying out such duties. Requires the task force to establish, implement, and report to the Congress on an effective international evaluation audit plan designed to enable the represented agencies to carry out their duties. Requires the Secretary of State to: (1) consider in a timely manner the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for the placement of Secret Service agents in posts in overseas embassies for the effective enforcement of prohibitions against international counterfeiting of U.S. currency; and (2) reach an agreement with the Secretary on such posts by December 31, 1996. Requires the Secretaries to each submit a written report, by February 1, 1997, to specified congressional committees explaining the reasons for any rejection of a proposed post and any failure to fill an approved post by such date. Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to amend its sentencing guidelines to provide an appropriate enhancement of the punishment (a maximum 20-year prison term) for a defendant convicted under the Federal criminal code of international counterfeiting of U.S. currency."
