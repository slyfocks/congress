Anti-Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act - Requires certain insurers to maintain, submit to the Secretary of Commerce, and make available to the public specified information on their practices and activities with respect to property and casualty insurance sold in urban areas, such as the number of policies sold by metropolitan statistical area (MSA), itemized by demographic characteristics. Directs the Secretary to: (1) study and report to certain congressional committees on the availability of commercial insurance for small businesses; and (2) develop and submit to such committees a proposed data collection pilot project in certain MSAs to ascertain the need for additional data to evaluate the availability of insurance coverage for small businesses. Directs the Secretary to: (1) exempt insurers operating under State disclosure requirements or laws similar to those under this Act; and (2) implement a public information system arranging for a central depository in each designated MSA to disseminate the information required under this Act. Prescribes data collection parameters for designated MSAs, insurers, and lines of property and casualty insurance, including: (1) private passenger automobile insurance; (2) homeowners insurance; and (3) dwelling fire and allied lines of insurance. Requires the Secretary to establish a task force on insurance agency appointments to review and report to certain congressional committees on: (1) the status of insurance agency appointments for inner city and minority agents; (2) the practices of insurers in terminating agents; and (3) recommendations to improve the ability of inner city and minority agents to market property and casualty insurance. Permits the Secretary to use data collection contractors and statistical agents. Requires the Secretary to compile data annually for each MSA for all insurers either subject to or exempt from this Act. Provides civil penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to study and report to certain congressional committees on: (1) the feasibility and utility of collecting information on specified characteristics of insurance applicants and the reasons for their rejection; and (2) actions by insurers to meet the property and casualty insurance needs of low- and moderate-income and minority neighborhoods, and the small businesses located in such neighborhoods.</summary>
