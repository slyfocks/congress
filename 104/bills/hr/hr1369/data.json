(Sec. 3) Requires the FAA Administrator to: (1) communicate with pilots regarding NPS concerns and objectives about low-flying aircraft in specified areas; (2) investigate pilot deviations from the requirements of this Act and take action to discourage such deviations; (3) provide assistance to the NPS in communicating with various agencies in the Department of Defense about military aircraft operations over NPS areas; (4) make the results of such investigation available to the NPS at the FAA Flight Standards district office; (5) enlist the support of all aviation groups and organizations; and (6) participate in appropriate meetings at field and regional levels to assist the NPS in combating problems associated with low-flying aircraft. (Sec. 4) Prohibits the flying of commercial tour aircraft over Kaloko Honokohau, Pu'u honua o Honaunau, Pu'u kohola Heiau, and Kalaupapa National Historical Parks, Haleakala National Park, and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Requires scenic tour aircraft to maintain a two-mile standoff distance from such areas. Makes it unlawful for any fixed wing aircraft or helicopter flying under visual flight rules to fly at less than 1,500 feet over the surface of any NPS lands in Hawaii not subject to earlier provisions of this Act. (Sec. 5) Lists joint responsibilities of the Director and the Administrator regarding additional assessments of adverse impacts of aircraft operators, means of generating pilot understanding of NPS resource management objectives, and procedures for addressing public land over-flight issues.
