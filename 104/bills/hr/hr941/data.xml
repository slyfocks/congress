  <summary>2/14/1995--Introduced.
Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to prohibit and set penalties for knowingly circumcising, excising, or infibulating any part of the labia majora, labia minora, or clitoris of another person who has not attained age 18, except where: (1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is performed by a person licensed as a medical practitioner; or (2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given birth if performed for medical purposes connected with such labor or birth by a person licensed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in training. Prohibits and sets penalties for knowingly denying or otherwise discriminating against a person in the provision of medical care or services because that person has: (1) undergone female circumcision, excision, or infibulation; or (2) requested that such procedure be performed on any person. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) compile data on the number of females living in the United States who have been subjected to female genital mutilation (whether in the United States or in their countries of origin), including a specification of the number of such females under age 18; (2) identify U.S. communities that practice female genital mutilation and design and carry out outreach activities to educate individuals in the communities on the physical and psychological health effects of such practice; and (3) develop recommendations for the education of students of schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine regarding female genital mutilation and complications.</summary>
