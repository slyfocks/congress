    "text": "NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 - Declares that it should be the policy of the United States to: (1) assist the transition to full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe; (2) ensure that such countries are aware of the costs and responsibilities of such membership; and (3) work to construct a political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian Federation. Expresses the sense of the Congress that in order to promote security in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine: (1) the United States should continue to support the full and active participation of these countries in activities that will qualify them for NATO membership; (2) the U.S. Government should continue to press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country qualifying for membership; and (3) the United States and NATO should continue to support military and peacekeeping initiatives between and among such countries and NATO countries. Expresses the sense of the Congress that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns and should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union. Designates Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as eligible to receive certain assistance for transition to full membership in NATO. Declares that such designation shall not preclude the designation by the President of other Central and Eastern Europe countries.
