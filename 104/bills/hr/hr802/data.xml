  <summary>02/02/1995--Introduced.
Prohibits the Federal Government from paying retirement benefits to or through any person who ceases Federal employment after the year 2000, unless that person is retired as defined under the Social Security Act. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to former public safety officers (as defined under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968) and former members of the armed forces who have been exposed to actual combat dangers as a result of hostile activities by opposing forces.</summary>
