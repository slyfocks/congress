  <summary>7/20/1995--Introduced.
Sanctity of Life Act of 1995 - Declares that: (1) for the purpose of enforcing the obligation of the States under the 14th amendment to the Constitution not to deprive persons of life without due process of law, human life shall be deemed to exist from conception without regard to race, sex, age, health, defect, or condition of dependency; and (2) each State has a compelling interest, independent of the status of the unborn children under the 14th amendment, in protecting the lives of those in the State's jurisdiction whom the State rationally regards as human beings. Amends the Federal criminal code to declare that the Supreme Court and district courts shall not have jurisdiction over any case arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice on the grounds that the statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth or prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for the performance of abortions.</summary>
