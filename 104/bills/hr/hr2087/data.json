Amends the Federal criminal code to declare that the Supreme Court and district courts shall not have jurisdiction over any case arising out of any statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice on the grounds that the statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or practice protects the rights of human persons between conception and birth or prohibits, limits, or regulates the performance of abortions or the provision of public funds, facilities, personnel, or other assistance for the performance of abortions."
