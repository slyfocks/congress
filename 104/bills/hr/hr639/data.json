    "text": "West Virginia National Rivers Technical Amendments Act of 1995 - Amends the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to: (1) direct the Secretary of the Interior to permit West Virginia to undertake fish stocking activities within the boundaries of the New River Gorge National River; and (2) make applicable to such national river provisions of the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987 allowing for cooperative agreements between the Secretary and such State for the maintenance and improvement of existing public roads and rights-of-way. Amends the West Virginia National Interest River Conservation Act of 1987 to defeat a boundary modification with respect to the Gauley River National Recreation Area in West Virginia if project construction at such Area is not commenced within the required time period or if the construction license is surrendered at any time. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees setting forth a plan to provide river access for noncommercial recreation users within such Area. Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary to enter into an agreement or acquire such lands as necessary to allow public access to the Bluestone River, West Virginia, and provide parking and related facilities near Eads Mill."
