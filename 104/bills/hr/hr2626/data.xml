  <summary>11/13/1995--Introduced.
Provides that in any case in which appropriations are not otherwise available for the payment of veterans' disability compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall nevertheless ensure that such payments are made in accordance with regular procedures and schedules. Appropriates necessary amounts for such purpose. Requires such payments to be made also in any case in which certain functions of the Government are delayed, deferred, or canceled due to a limitation on the Government's ability to borrow funds. Requires applicable accounts to be charged for such payments when regular appropriations become available.</summary>
