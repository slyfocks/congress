  <summary>7/13/1995--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Alaska Power Administration Sale Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy to sell: (1) the Snettisham Hydroelectric Project to the State of Alaska; and (2) the Eklutna Hydroelectric Project to the Municipality of Anchorage doing business as Municipal Light and Power, the Chugach Electric Association, Inc., and the Matanuska Electric Association, Inc. (Eklutna Purchasers). Authorizes appropriations. Declares that both Projects shall continue to be exempt from Federal Power Act requirements (subject to a certain Memorandum of Agreement). Grants jurisdiction to the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska to review and enforce such Memorandum, including the remedy of specific performance. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) issue rights-of-way with respect to certain Eklutna lands to the Alaska Power Administration for subsequent reassignment to the Eklutna Purchasers; and (2) convey to the State of Alaska (with respect to certain Snettisham lands) improved lands under a certain statutory selection entitlement. Grants the State of Alaska one year within which to select lands authorized under this Act or any Purchase Agreement incorporated or ratified by it, notwithstanding expiration of such right under specified law. Sets a deadline by which the Secretary of Energy must: (1) complete the business of and close out the Alaska Power Administration (APA); (2) submit a report to the Congress documenting such sale; and (3) return unobligated balances of funds appropriated for the (APA) to the Treasury. States that termination of the APA shall take effect upon submission of such report.</summary>
