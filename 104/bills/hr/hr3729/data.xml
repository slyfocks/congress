Defend America Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 - Amends Federal law to direct the Secretary of Defense to carry out a research and development program to enhance U.S. capabilities relating to the threat of an attack inside the United States by unconventional means involving weapons of mass destruction. Specifies that the activities to be carried out by the Secretary under the program shall include: (1) research, development, test, and evaluation of technologies relating to detection of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, interception of and protection against such weapons, assistance to other Federal departments and agencies and State and local agencies in responding to an attack, including casualty treatment, and decontamination of areas affected by an attack; (2) training of personnel for such activities; and (3) identification of Federal equipment and technologies that can be transferred, and training that can be provided, from one Federal agency to another or to State and local agencies consistent with the purposes of the program. Amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to authorize Federal technical assistance to the States in developing comprehensive plans and practicable programs for preparation against major disasters involving weapons of mass destruction. Sets forth reporting requirements.</summary>
