Public Interest Legislature Act - Amends the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to: (1) require specified details in financial disclosure reports by congressional officers and employees; (2) modify reporting requirements, among other changes lowering the threshold at which total liabilities owed to certain creditors become reportable; and (3) require Members of Congress to divest themselves of any asset or interest which exceeds $1,000 in real property (other than property used solely as the personal residence of that Member or that Member's spouse) or in stocks, bonds, commodity futures, or other forms of securities or place all such assets and interests in a qualified blind trust. Prohibits the use of House of Representatives allowances for financial disclosure report preparation.</summary>
