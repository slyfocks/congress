  <summary>9/25/1996--Introduced.
Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 - Prohibits any person from arranging, promoting, organizing, producing, or fighting in a professional boxing match held in a State that has no boxing commission unless the match is: (1) supervised by a commission from another State; and (2) subject to the most recent Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) guidelines, as well as any additional relevant professional regulations and requirements of such other State. Requires, for any professional boxing match: (1) a physical examination of each boxer to determine fitness to compete; (2) the presence of an ambulance or medical personnel and a physician on site; and (3) health insurance coverage for each boxer. (Sec. 6) Requires each professional boxer to register with the commission of the State in which such boxer resides or, in the case of a boxer who is a resident of a foreign country or a State in which there is no such commission, the commission of any other State. Directs a commission to issue to each registering boxer an identification card that contains a recent photograph, a social security or similar identification number, and a personal identification number assigned by a boxing registry. (Sec. 7) Directs each commission to establish procedures to: (1) evaluate the professional records and physician's certification of each boxer participating in a match in the State and to deny fight authorization where appropriate; (2) ensure that no boxer is permitted to box while under suspension from any commission due to a recent knockout or series of consecutive losses, an injury, a required medical procedure, a physician denial of certification, failure of a drug test, or use of false aliases, identification cards, or documents; (3) review a suspension when appealed by a boxer; and (4) revoke a suspension where appropriate proof is presented that a suspension was not, or is no longer, merited by the facts. Authorizes a commission to allow a boxer who is under suspension in any State to participate in a boxing match: (1) for any reason other than those listed above if such commission notifies the suspending commission in writing prior to its approval; or (2) if the boxer appeals to the ABC and the ABC determines that the suspension was without sufficient grounds, for an improper purpose, or not related to the boxer's health or safety or the purposes of this Act. (Sec. 8) Requires the supervising commission, within 48 business hours after the conclusion of a fight, to report fight results and any related suspensions to each boxer registry. (Sec. 9) Outlines conflict-of-interest requirements for commission members or employees, persons who administer or enforce State boxing laws, and members of the ABC. (Sec. 10) Authorizes the Attorney General to bring a civil action against persons in violation of this Act for appropriate relief, including match injunctions. Prescribes criminal penalties for violations of this Act. (Sec. 11) Requires each promoter who intends to hold a match in a State that does not have a boxing commission, at least 14 days before such fight, to provide written notification to the supervising boxing authority containing: (1) assurances that the requirements of this Act will be met; and (2) the identity of any participating fighter who is under suspension from a boxing commission and the identity of such commission. (Sec. 12) Requires a study by: (1) the Secretary of Labor on the feasibility and cost of a national pension system for boxers; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop recommendations for health, safety, and equipment standards for boxers and matches. (Sec. 13) Authorizes an Indian tribal organization to regulate, or enter into a contract for a boxing commission to regulate, matches held on a reservation. Requires a tribal organization that regulates its own matches to establish and implement health and safety standards, licensing, and related requirements that are at least as restrictive as: (1) the standards of the State in which the reservation is located; or (2) the most recent ABC guidelines.</summary>
