  <summary>7/22/1996--Passed House amended.
Airline Pilot Hiring and Safety Act of 1996 - Amends Federal aviation law to require air carriers to request and receive a pilot applicant's record for the previous five years with respect to: (1) current airman certificate, including any summaries of legal enforcement actions; (2) employment; and (3) motor vehicle driving record. Prohibits any Federal or State court action for defamation or invasion of privacy against any carrier or person with respect to the furnishing or use of such records according to the requirements of this Act. Directs the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish certain minimum standards for pilot qualifications for employment. Directs the Administrator of the FAA to study and report to the Congress on: (1) the appropriateness of requiring the Secretary of Defense to provide an air carrier with the armed services records of an applicant pilot; and (2) whether current minimum flight time requirements applicable to individuals seeking employment as pilots with air carriers are sufficient to ensure public safety.</summary>
