Family Privacy Protection Act of 1995 - Declares that in conducting a program or activity funded in whole or in part by the Federal Government a person may not, without prior written parental or guardian consent (or, if the minor is emancipated, without the minor's own prior consent), require or otherwise seek the response of the minor to a survey or questionnaire intended to elicit, or having the effect of eliciting, information concerning: (1) parental political affiliations or beliefs; (2) mental or psychological problems; (3) sexual behavior or attitudes; (4) illegal, anti-social, or self-incriminating behavior; (5) appraisals of other individuals with whom the minor has a familial relationship; (6) relationships legally recognized as privileged, such as those with lawyers, physicians, and clergy; or (7) religious affiliations or beliefs. Exempts from this prohibition: (1) the seeking of information for the purpose of a criminal investigation or adjudication; (2) any inquiry made pursuant to a good faith concern for the health, safety, or welfare of an individual minor; (3) administration of the immigration, internal revenue, or customs laws of the United States; or (4) the seeking of any information required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance. Exempts from such prohibition as well any tests intended to measure academic performance except to the extent that questions in such tests would require a minor to reveal information proscribed by this Act. Prescribes agency notice and compliance requirements. States that this Act does not apply to any program or activity which is subject to the General Education Provisions Act.</summary>
