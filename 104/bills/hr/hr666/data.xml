  <summary>2/8/1995--Passed House amended.
Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to bar the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure carried out under circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the Fourth Amendment. Specifies that the fact that evidence was obtained pursuant to and within the scope of a warrant constitutes prima facie evidence of the existence of such circumstances. Prohibits the exclusion of evidence on the ground that it was obtained in violation of a statute, administrative rule or regulation, or rule of procedure unless exclusion is expressly authorized by statute or by a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Provides that evidence which is otherwise excludable under such provision shall not be excludable where the search and seizure was carried out in circumstances justifying an objectively reasonable belief that it was in conformity with the pertinent statute, administrative rule or regulation, or rule of procedure. Makes this Act inapplicable to a search or seizure carried out by, or under the authority of, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms or the Internal Revenue Service.</summary>
