  <summary>1/25/1995--Introduced.
Recreational Boating Safety Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of Transportation to increase enforcement of boating-while-intoxicated laws in areas where many boating accidents have occurred or where such accidents have involved the use of alcohol. Amends Federal recreational vessel safety law to direct the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring individuals age 12 or younger to wear a personal flotation device. Requires the Secretary to submit to certain congressional committees plans to: (1) approve fully inflatable life jackets for use as personal flotation devices; and (2) increase reporting of vessel accidents to State law enforcement officials. Directs the Secretary to provide for a three-level State marine casualty reporting system for serious recreational vessel accidents. Includes among the penalties for negligent operation of a recreational vessel a mandatory boating safety course. Requires the Secretary to submit to certain congressional committees a plan to provide mandatory safe boating education and certification to individuals aged 12 or younger who operate recreational vessels.</summary>
