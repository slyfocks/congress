  <summary>10/26/1995--Introduced.
Prison Inmate Training and Rehabilitation Act of 1995 - Directs Federal Prison Industries (FPI) to conduct pilot programs to test the feasibility of providing increased employment for Federal prisoners by producing items for the private market that would otherwise be produced by foreign labor. Permits FPI to enter into agreements with private industry to carry out this Act. Exempts: (1) items produced in such programs from legal restrictions on the sale of items produced by prison labor; (2) decisions in such programs from restrictions under the Federal criminal code on FPI decisions to produce new products or significantly expand the production of existing products; and (3) the business operations of such programs from application of competitive procedures. Directs the board of directors of FPI to include in its annual report to the Congress its findings on the results of such programs and recommendations as to whether to expand this concept within the Federal prison system.</summary>
