  <summary>7/11/1995--Introduced.
Provides for an automatic continuing appropriation for the U.S. Government whenever a regular appropriation bill for a fiscal year does not become law prior to the beginning of such fiscal year. Appropriates such sums as may be necessary to continue any project or activity for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year in the amount provided: (1) in the corresponding regular appropriation Act for such preceding fiscal year; or (2) if such corresponding appropriation bill did not become law then as provided by this Act. Sets forth the terms and conditions relating to such continuing appropriations. Prohibits funding for any project or activity: (1) for which there is no authorization of appropriations for such fiscal year; or (2) during a fiscal year if any other provision of law makes an appropriation, makes funds available, grants continuation authority, or specifically prohibits funding or authority for such project or activity.</summary>
