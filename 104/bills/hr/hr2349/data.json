    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: National Highway System Title II: Highway Funding Restoration Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 - Title I: National Highway System - Designates the National Highway System (NHS) as submitted by the Secretary of Transportation on September 1, 1995. Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to submit to specified congressional committees for approval a proposed modification of the NHS, subject to specified requirements, which shall take effect only if a law has been enacted approving such modification. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) initial proposed modifications to the NHS; (2) congressional high priority corridors; and (3) interim eligibility for Federal highway funds. Title II: Highway Funding Restoration - Highway Funding Restoration Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary to allocate among the States specified amounts for Interstate highway substitute, NHS, surface transportation program, Interstate, congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program, bridge, hazard elimination, and rail- highway crossings projects (State High Priority Project Restoration Program, hereinafter referred to as the High Priority Program) for FY 1996 and 1997. Specifies allocation percentages by State. Provides that such allocations shall not affect a State's minimum allocation of Federal-aid highway funds or specified allocations under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the period of availability; (2) a special rule for the obligation of allocations in urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000; and (3) limits on planning expenditures. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 204) Rescinds funds from various previously authorized projects and from unobligated balances of funds previously made available and derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Reduces the authorized funding levels for certain programs (regarding magnetic levitation and highway safety) funded from the HTF for FY 1996 and 1997. Transfers certain funds (regarding the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program) derived from the HTF made available for such fiscal years to carry out the High Priority Program. (Sec. 205) Directs the Secretary: (1) to notify each State of the total amount of the reduction in authorized funds for FY 1996 that would have been allocated and apportioned to such State, as a result of specified ISTEA provisions; and (2) in determining such amount, to deduct the amount allocated to each State in FY 1996 pursuant to the High Priority Program and certain other amounts available for FY 1996. Requires: (1) each State to designate on or before November 1, 1995, or as soon as possible thereafter, unobligated balances of funds apportioned or allocated on or before September 30, 1995, and which are subject to the obligation ceiling, that may be made available for any purpose currently eligible under the Minimum Allocation Program; and (2) the Secretary to make such funds available to the States before November 15, 1995, or as soon as possible thereafter. Prohibits unobligated balances of funds attributed to urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000 from being designated by the State without the concurrence, in writing, of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) designated for such area. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) congestion mitigation and air quality balances; (2) interstate construction balances; (3) periods of availability; and (4) limits on statutory construction. (Sec. 206) Revises provisions regarding the method of distribution of funds made available under the Minimum Allocation Program in FY 1996 and 1997. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) a special rule for urbanized areas of over 200,000 in FY 1996 and 1997; and (2) funding. (Sec. 207) Prohibits the Secretary from penalizing States for failure to implement various highway and transportation management systems during FY 1996. Repeals a requirement that States meet minimum utilization requirements for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber and the penalties for failure to meet those requirements. Title III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Directs the Secretary to distribute any limitation otherwise imposed on transit operating assistance so that each urbanized area that had a population of less than 200,000 under the 1990 decennial census will receive for FY 1996 75 percent of the amount the area received under such distribution for FY 1995. Requires the Secretary, in the distribution of such limitation to urbanized areas that had a population under such census of one million or more, to direct each such area to give priority consideration to the impact of reductions in operating assistance on smaller transit authorities operating within the area and to consider the needs and resources of such authorities when the limitation is distributed among all transit authorities operating in the area. (Sec. 302) Directs the Secretary to: (1) require each recipient of Federal financial assistance for a highway or transit project with an estimated total cost of $1 billion or more to submit to the Secretary an annual financial plan, which shall be based on detailed annual estimates of the cost to complete the remaining elements of the project and on reasonable assumptions (as determined by the Secretary) of future increases in the cost to complete the project; (2) make a recommendation to the Congress on whether or not future Federal assistance should be withheld regarding any such project for which an annual financial plan is not submitted or for which the Secretary determines that the estimates or assumptions are not reasonable; and (3) submit to the Congress an annual report on the financial plans submitted and any such recommendation. (Sec. 303) Prohibits the Secretary of Transportation, after this Act's enactment and before the date on which Federal-aid highway and transit programs are reauthorized, from issuing a letter of intent, or entering into a full financing grant agreement or early systems work agreement for a project or operable segment of a project unless the full amount of Federal financial responsibility for the project or segment has been included in an authorization law. Makes such prohibition inapplicable to any project: (1) for which a letter of intent was issued before this Act's enactment date; and (2) included as an element of an interrelated project which also includes another project for which a letter of intent was issued before such date. (Sec. 304) Requires an annual report on Capital Projects for Fixed Guideway Systems and Extensions of Existing Fixed Guideway Systems to include: (1) an analysis of potential funding requirements of the project in the succeeding five fiscal years; and (2) a description of the planning and study process undertaken to select the locally preferred alternative, and of efforts undertaken to seek alternative funding sources, for the project. (Sec. 305) Repeals the authorization for the Long Beach Metro Link Fixed Rail Project. Reduces the authorization for the Honolulu Rapid Transit Project. (Sec. 306) Modifies various previously authorized transit projects and makes funds available for certain additional projects. (Sec. 307) Adds consideration of recreational travel and tourism to the metropolitan planning process under the transit program. (Sec. 308) Requires that any contract or subcontract awarded for engineering and design services, whether funded in whole or in part with Federal transit funds, be performed and audited in compliance with cost principles contained in the Federal acquisition regulations. Requires the recipient of Federal funds to: (1) accept and use indirect cost rates established by a government agency in accordance with such regulations for one-year applicable accounting periods in estimating, negotiating, and administering contracts; (2) notify affected firms before requesting and using the cost and rate data; and (3) keep such data confidential.

(Sec. 325) Specifies that the Federal ban on outdoor advertising on scenic highways does not restrict the authority of a State with respect to commercial and industrial areas along a scenic byway, nor does it prevent a State from establishing standards stricter than those in Federal law. (Sec. 326) Adds recreational travel and tourism to the factors that must be considered by MPOs in developing transportation plans and programs. (Sec. 327) Allows any non-Federal funds expended for the seismic retrofit of certain toll bridges to be credited toward the non-Federal share required as a condition of receipt of Federal funds for such retrofit made available after the date of the expenditure. (Sec. 328) Specifies that data collected for safety reports or surveys shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in Federal or State court proceedings. (Sec. 329) Revises the National Recreational Trails Program under ISTEA, including a provision requiring States to provide 20 percent of the program costs in the sixth year of the program. Requires a State to give priority to projects which mitigate and minimize impacts to the environment. Permits a State to apply to the Secretary for an exemption from requirements for the distribution of Federal trail program funds. (Sec. 330) Revises ISTEA regarding the routing of certain existing high priority corridors and adds additional high priority corridors.
