    "text": "Small Business Remediation Act of 1995 - Requires the maximum level of remediation of dry cleaning solvents in soil, surface water, groundwater, and other environmental media (soil) that a Federal, State, local agency, or court may require of a person engaged in dry cleaning, or of the owner of land or a facility in which such a person is conducting dry cleaning, to be one-tenth the equivalent exposure of the workplace standard for such solvents established by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Requires: (1) the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to publish in the Federal Register its computation, based on realistic scientific assumptions, of equivalent exposure by ingestion, inhalation, and absorption indices for the general public, for soil in nonoccupational circumstances; and (2) the equivalent exposure to be calculated from the workplace standard for dry cleaning solvents which assures that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure for the employee's entire working lifetime. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall: (1) preempt or otherwise prevent a Federal, State, or local government or private party from remediating soil to a lower level than the maximum level of remediation at its own cost and expense; or (2) alter or affect the Federal drinking water standards under the Public Health Service Act."
