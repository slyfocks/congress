  <summary>12/6/1995--Introduced.
Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to enter into an agreement with a State and its political subdivisions under which: (1) the State and political subdivision employees having the requisite expertise and background will operate components of the National Park System (NPS) in the State during any period in a fiscal year in which the Service is unable to maintain the normal level of park operations; (2) before the time when their services may be required, the Secretary, using available appropriations, will provide any training that such employees may need to perform operations; and (3) the Secretary may accept a monetary donation from a State or its political subdivision to enable the Secretary to operate NPS components during such period. Allows the Secretary, subject to the availability of appropriations, to reimburse the State and political subdivisions for costs incurred in performance of the agreement. Makes a State or its political subdivision liable to the United States in indemnification for any Federal liability imposed for an act or omission by an employee or political subdivision providing such services.</summary>
