  <summary>9/24/1996--Introduced.
Amends the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 to eliminate the requirement of a post-September 15, 1978, divorce for certain former spouses of Federal employees in order for them to be eligible for a survivor annuity. Extends from May 7, 1989, to May 7, 1997, the deadline for applying for such annuity. Authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to waive such deadline under certain circumstances. Makes such spouses eligible for Federal health benefits.</summary>
