Appropriates such sums as may be necessary to continue any project or activity for which funds were provided in the preceding fiscal year in the amount provided: (1) in the corresponding regular appropriation Act or continuing resolution for such preceding fiscal year; or (2) if such corresponding appropriation bill or continuing resolution did not become law, then as provided by this Act. Sets forth the terms and conditions relating to such continuing appropriations.
