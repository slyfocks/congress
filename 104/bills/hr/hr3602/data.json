Sets forth the duties of the Director, including: (1) developing and implementing the program; (2) establishing goals, priorities, and target dates for such implementation; and (3) providing a method for cooperation and coordination with, and (as feasible) providing assistance to, interested governmental entities in all States. Establishes program objectives, including: (1) ensuring that new and existing dams are safe through the development of technologically and economically feasible programs and procedures for national dam safety hazard reduction; (2) encouraging acceptable engineering policies and procedures used for dam site investigation, design, construction, operation and maintenance, and emergency preparedness and establishment and implementation of effective dam safety programs in each participating State based on State standards; and (3) developing public awareness projects, technical assistance materials, and mechanisms with which to provide technical assistance for dam safety to the non-Federal sector. Sets forth provisions regarding program components, including Federal and non-Federal elements, and three functional activities (leadership, technical assistance, and public awareness). Requires the Director to: (1) develop an implementation plan which shall demonstrate dam safety improvements through FY 2001 and recommend appropriate roles for Federal agencies, State and local governments, individuals, and private organizations; and (2) submit a biennial report to the Congress describing the status of the program and the progress achieved by the Federal agencies during the previous two years in implementing the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety. Authorizes establishment of the Board, which shall be responsible for monitoring participating State implementation of the requirements of the assistance program. Authorizes appropriations. Sets forth an apportionment formula. Requires the Director to: (1) provide, at the request of any State that has or intends to develop a dam safety program, training for State dam safety staff and inspectors; and (2) undertake a program of technical and archival research. Authorizes the Secretary of the Army to maintain and periodically publish updated information on the inventory of dams."
