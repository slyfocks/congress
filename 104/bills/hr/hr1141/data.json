Requires an integrated natural resource management plan (plan) to be included in each program. Authorizes the Secretary to manage each military installation to provide: (1) for the conservation of fish and wildlife on such installation and sustained multipurpose uses of those resources; and (2) necessary or appropriate public access for those uses. Requires the plan to address the needs for fish and wildlife management, land management, forest management, and wildlife-oriented recreation. Requires an opportunity for public comment on each plan prepared. Requires the: (1) Secretaries of each military department to review and report to the Secretary on military installations under their jurisdiction for which a plan would be appropriate; and (2) Secretary to report to the Congress on such reviews. Sets a deadline for the establishment of such plans. Directs the Secretary to annually review the extent to which plans were prepared or in effect and implemented during the preceding year. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to specified congressional committees on funds expended on conservation activities conducted pursuant to such plans. Provides for the enforcement on military installations of all Federal laws relating to natural resources conservation on Federal lands. Requires the Secretary of each military department to ensure that sufficient numbers of trained natural resource management and law enforcement personnel are available and assigned to perform tasks necessary to ensure plan compliance. Entitles the Act of September 15, 1960, as the Sikes Act. Extends through FY 1998 the authorization of appropriations for natural resources conservation programs on military installations, as well as equivalent programs on other public lands."
