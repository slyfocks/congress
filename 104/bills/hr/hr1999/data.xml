  <summary>7/10/1995--Introduced.
Establishes the Augusta Canal National Heritage Area in Georgia. Requires the Augusta Canal Authority to prepare and submit to the Secretary of the Interior for review and approval a plan for the management of the Area, based on existing Federal, State, and local plans in existence on the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Authority to coordinate and combine such plans and present an integrated and cooperative approach for the protection, enhancement, and interpretation of the Area's cultural, natural, scenic, and recreational resources. Prohibits the Authority from using any Federal funds to acquire real property or interest in such property. Declares that nothing in this Act shall be construed to: (1) authorize Federal agencies to promulgate an occupational, safety, conservation, or environmental regulation for the Area that is more stringent than existing applicable regulations, solely as a result of the establishment of the Area; (2) modify, enlarge, or diminish the authority of Federal, State, and local governments to regulate any use of land as provided for by current law or regulation; or (3) grant powers of zoning or land use to the Authority. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
