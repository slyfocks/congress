  <summary>10/10/1995--Introduced.
Frequent Flyer Act of 1995 - Amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to: (1) require that travel awards accrued by reason of official travel by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate or the House of Representatives (current law applies to only the Senate) be used only for official travel; and (2) allow a Member of Congress to transfer such a travel award to a nonprofit tax-exempt organization. Expresses the sense of the Congress that commercial airlines should provide that travel awards are transferable in a manner consistent with this Act.</summary>
