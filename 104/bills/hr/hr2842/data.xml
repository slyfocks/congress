Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for the issuance of interest-free loans to furloughed Federal employees from funds otherwise available in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or the Thrift Savings Fund. Limits the total amount of such loans to the basic pay of such employees for the period of lapsed appropriations. Provides for the repayment of such loans by withholding from any payment of basic pay remaining unpaid for the period of lapsed appropriations with respect to employees who remain employed with their respective Federal agencies after such period. Excludes political appointees from the provisions of this Act.</summary>
