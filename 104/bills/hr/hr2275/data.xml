TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Private Property Rights and Voluntary Incentives for Private Property Owners Title II: Improving Ability to Comply with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 Title III: Improving Scientific Integrity of Listing Decisions and Procedures Title IV: Recognizing Other Federal Action, Laws, and Missions Title V: Better Management and Conservation of Listed Species Title VI: Habitat Protections Title VII: State Authority to Protect Endangered and Threatened Species Title VIII: Funding of Conservation Measures Title IX: Miscellaneous Provisions Endangered Species Conservation and Management Act of 1995 - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (the Act) to revise: (1) the findings and purposes of the Act to include consideration of economic impacts and property owners' rights while encouraging practices that protect species; and (2) the policy of the Act to prohibit the Federal Government from using or limiting the use of privately owned property when such action diminishes the value of such property without payment of fair market value to the owner of private property. Title I: Private Property Rights and Voluntary Incentives for Private Property Owners - Amends the Act to prohibit the Government from taking an agency action affecting privately or non-federally owned property under the Act which results in diminishment of value of any portion of that property by 20 percent or more unless compensation is offered in accordance with this title. Requires: (1) the Federal agency that takes an action that exceeds that amount to compensate the private property owner for the otherwise lawful use or limitation on such use in the amount of the diminution in value of the portion of that property resulting from such use or limitation; (2) the agency, if the diminution in value of a portion of that property is greater than 50 percent, at the option of the owner, to buy that portion and pay fair market value based on the value of the property before the use or limitation was imposed; and (3) that compensation paid reflect the duration of the use or limitation necessary to achieve the purposes of the Act. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) procedures for written requests for compensation by the owner; (2) agency negotiations with that owner to reach agreement; (3) choice of remedies; (4) arbitration; (5) civil actions (an owner who prevails in a civil action against the agency shall be entitled to the amount of compensation awarded plus reasonable attorney's fees and other litigation costs); (6) source of payments; (7) availability of appropriations (any U.S. obligation to make such a payment shall be subject to the availability of appropriations); and (8) duty of providing notice to owners of agency actions limiting the use of private property and of procedures for obtaining compensation. (Sec. 102) Requires the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), in carrying out the program authorized by the Act, to cooperate to the maximum extent practicable with the States and other non-Federal persons, including by engaging in consultation before acquiring any land or water or interest therein for the purpose of conserving any endangered or threatened species. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into a cooperative management agreement with any State or local government or non-Federal person for the management of a species listed as endangered or threatened, to be listed, or which is a candidate for listing or for the management or acquisition of an area which provides habitat for a species, subject to specified limitations. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) environmental assessments; (2) the effect of listing a species; and (3) violations of such agreements. Specifies that consultation with States pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary to provide grants to certain non-Federal persons for the purpose of conserving, preserving, or improving habitat for any species that is determined to be an endangered or threatened species or for any conservation measures that enhance the survivability of such species, including predator control, upon determining that: (1) the property for which the grant is provided contains habitat that significantly contributes to the protection of the population of the species and has been managed for species protection for a sufficient period of time to significantly contribute to the protection of the species population; and (2) the management of the habitat advances the interest of species protection. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary to initiate a program to provide technical advice and assistance to non-Federal persons who wish to participate in achieving the conservation objective for a species. (Sec. 105) Specifies that nothing in the Act shall be construed to supersede, abrogate, or otherwise impair any right or authority of a State to allocate or administer quantities of water. Title II: Improving Ability to Comply With the Endangered Species Act of 1973 - Amends the Act to provide that an activity of a non-Federal person is not a taking of a species if the activity: (1) is consistent with the provisions of a final conservation plan or conservation objective; (2) complies with the terms and conditions of an incidental take permit or a cooperative management agreement; (3) addresses a critical, imminent threat to public health or safety or a catastrophic natural event, or is mandated by any Federal, State, or local government agency for public health or safety purposes; (4) is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity that consists of on-going maintenance, routine operation or use, and certain emergency repairs, road and right-of-way maintenance, use, and repair, or emergency repair or restoration of any property or non-Federal facility to the condition in which it existed or operated immediately before an emergency or disaster, meeting current standards; or (5) is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity that occurs in an area of the territorial sea or exclusive economic zone that is not designated as critical habitat and the affected species is not a species of fish. Makes enforcement provisions and provisions regarding rewards and incidental expenses paid by the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury applicable specifically to endangered or threatened species of fish and wildlife. Specifies that no interpretation, policy, guideline, finding, or other informal determination may be relied upon by the Secretary in the implementation and enforcement of the Act unless such determination has been the subject of a proposed rule, subject to specified requirements. Places the burden on the Secretary to show that a specimen belongs to a species which is determined to be an endangered or threatened species. Bars the Secretary from detaining a specimen for longer than 30 days for the purpose of identification except where the specimen has been substantially changed from its natural appearance, in which case it may be retained for an additional 30 days for identification. Authorizes civil suits by persons who have suffered or are threatened with economic or other injury resulting from actions by Federal officials with respect to enforcement of the Act under specified circumstances. (Sec. 202) Defines, for purposes of the Act: (1) "take" to mean to harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt to engage in that conduct; and (2) "harm" to mean to take a direct action against any member of an endangered species of fish or wildlife that actually injures or kills a member of the species. (Sec. 203) Authorizes non-Federal persons to initiate consultation with the Secretary on any prospective activity: (1) to determine if the activity is consistent with a conservation plan or objective; or (2) if the person determines that the activity is inconsistent, to determine whether the activity is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or to destroy or adversely modify the designated critical habitat of the species in a manner that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Bars any person that is not an owner of property from participating in the consultation process with respect to the property without written permission from the owner of the property.
