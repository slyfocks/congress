Terminally Ill Access to Treatment Act of 1996 - Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve, for treating the terminally ill only, drugs and devices that have not received final approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that have not been shown to be unsafe. Declares that it is not illegal for a health care practitioner to administer a drug or device approved under this Act to a terminally ill patient if the practitioner has notified the patient that the drug or device is not FDA-approved and is experimental and if the practitioner has received written approval from the patient or the patient's representative. Requires a practitioner to report acute harm done by such a drug or device. Requires the Secretary to give public notice of the benefits and harm caused by such a drug or device.</summary>
