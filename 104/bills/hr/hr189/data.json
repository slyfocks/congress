    "text": "Oil Recycling and Safe Handling Act of 1995 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to revise provisions concerning the management of used oil. Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to list as a hazardous waste any used oil and any product derived from such oil that fails to meet certain specifications for flashpoint, lead, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, halogens, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Permits fuel containing used oil that meets specifications without treatment to be marketed as containing ingredients that are not hazardous wastes if the oil and fuel are analyzed to demonstrate compliance. Exempts used oil generated by petroleum refining or production facilities which is to be refined along with normal process streams from requirements for hazardous waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act if it is inserted into the refining process or production pipeline. Directs the Administrator to promulgate regulations for the management of used oil classified as a hazardous waste. Exempts from such regulation generators of used oil which is household waste, curbside collection programs, and specified scrap materials. Exempts certain used oil generators and collectors from hazardous waste regulations under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (other than those under this Act) if they meet certain recycling, transportation, disposal, and recordkeeping requirements. Applies standards for hazardous waste transporters and facilities to hazardous used oil transporters and facilities. Requires hazardous used oil facilities to obtain hazardous waste management permits. Directs the Administrator to require producers and importers of lubricating base stock to guarantee the reuse of an annually increasing percentage of used lubricating oil. Requires States to provide incentives to persons who accept and collect used oil. Imposes fees on lubricating base stock sold at retail and provides for the use of such fees for State and local used oil collection efforts. Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to prohibit any person from bringing an action against (currently, recovering response costs or damages from) service station dealers for response costs or damages resulting from releases of used (currently, recycled) oil, subject to certain conditions."
