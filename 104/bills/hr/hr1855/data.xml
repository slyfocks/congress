  <summary>6/15/1995--Introduced.
Amends the District of Columbia Code to establish rules regarding pending minor child custody or visitation cases in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in which: (1) the child asserts that a party to the case has been sexually abusive with him or her; (2) the child has resided outside of the United States for at least 24 consecutive months; (3) any of the parties to the case has denied custody or visitation to another party in violation of a court order for at least 24 consecutive months; and (4) any of the parties to the case has lived outside of the District during such period of denial. Prohibits: (1) the abusive party, at any time after the child attains age 13, from having custody over, or visitation rights with, such child without the child's consent; or (2) the Court, if any person had actual or legal custody over, or offered safe refuge to, the child while the case or other related actions were pending, from depriving such person of custody or visitation rights over the child or otherwise imposing sanctions on the person on the grounds that he or she had such custody or offered such refuge.</summary>
