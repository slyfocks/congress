  <summary>2/24/1995--Introduced.
Pension Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with respect to pension integration, participation, and vesting requirements. Extends applicability of new integration rules under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to all existing accrued benefits. Amends the IRC to disallow integration for simplified employee pensions, by repealing provisions relating to permitted disparity under rules limiting discrimination under simplified employee pensions. Provides for eventual repeal of certain integration rules, by repealing for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, IRC provisions relating to: (1) pension integration exceptions under nondiscrimination requirements for qualification; and (2) nondiscriminatory coordination of defined contribution plans with Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance. Revises IRC minimum coverage requirements with respect to separate lines of business. Sets forth a special rule where the employer operates a single line of business. Limits a line of business exception. Eliminates a special vesting rule for multiemployer plans under IRC and ERISA. Provides for division of pension benefits upon divorce unless otherwise provided in qualified domestic relations orders. Provides for the continued availability of remedies relating to rights of spouses to accrued benefits under pension plans under divorce case domestic relations orders entered before 1985. Amends the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to revise provisions relating to divorced wives' eligibility for annuities.</summary>
