    "text": "Law Enforcement Officers Civil Liability Act of 1995 - Prohibits, in any Federal civil action against a law enforcement officer for conduct in the course of official duty, the award of punitive damages against that officer except to punish or deter conduct: (1) specifically intended unlawfully to cause serious personal injury; or (2) engaged in with flagrant indifference to the rights of the injured party and with an awareness that such conduct is likely to result in serious personal injury and is unlawful. Limits any such awards to $10,000, upon clear and convincing evidence to that effect. Specifies that the indemnification of any such officer, by any person or entity, for any punitive damages paid by that officer shall not in itself create any liability of that person or entity in any civil action. Limits the amount of attorney's fees that may be awarded in any civil action arising out of the conduct of a law enforcement officer in the course of official duty to one third of any monetary recovery."
