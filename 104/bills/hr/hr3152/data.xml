  <summary>3/22/1996--Introduced.
Wetland Creation and Improvement Act - Considers, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the cost of providing upland and confined aquatic dredged material disposal facilities associated with the construction, operation, and maintenance of all Federal navigation projects for harbors and inland harbors to be a general navigation feature of the project and subjects it to cost sharing in accordance of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Requires that the Federal share of the operation and maintenance of such disposal facilities be determined in accordance with that Act. Specifies included costs. Prohibits the expenditure of the Federal share until the Secretary of the Army determines that the funds are not otherwise required to cover other eligible operation and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation. Limits the total Federal share for each project.</summary>
