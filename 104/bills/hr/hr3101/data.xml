Mother and Child Protection Act of 1996 - Requires an entity that offers a health plan that provides maternity benefits, including childbirth benefits, to ensure that coverage is provided for: (1) a minimum of 48 hours after an inpatient vaginal delivery and a minimum of 120 hours after an inpatient caesarean section; (2) additional inpatient care after delivery if a licensed health care practitioner finds it medically necessary for the mother or newborn; (3) one home visit within 24 hours after discharge if a mother delivers in an inpatient setting and elects to leave the setting before the 48 or 120 hours; (4) parental education (including breast or bottle feeding training); and (5) performance of any maternal or newborn clinical assessments. Mandates regulations to ensure that an entity does not penalize a practitioner for administering care consistent with these provisions. Requires coverage notice to health plan enrollees.
