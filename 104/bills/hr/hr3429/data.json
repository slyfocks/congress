Allows a local government to determine not to apply the mailing requirement to a system serving fewer than 3,300 persons if such system: (1) so informs its customers; (2) makes information available upon request to the public regarding water quality; and (3) publishes the public notice as required by this Act. Authorizes a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility to establish alternative requirements with respect to the form and content of the report."
