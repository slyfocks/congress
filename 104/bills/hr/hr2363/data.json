Amends the FDIA to declare that assessment rates for SAIF members may not be less than assessment rates for BIF members. Amends the FDIA to: (1) repeal its exit moratorium and conversion (Oakar) provisions; (2) replace the BIF with a deposit insurance fund initially consisting of the merged assets and liabilities of the BIF and SAIF; (3) direct the FDIC to merge the BIF and SAIF into the deposit insurance fund by January 1, 1998; and (4) establish in the new deposit insurance fund a special emergency reserve. (Sec. 104) Prescribes procedural guidelines with respect to the refund of amounts in a deposit insurance fund in excess of the designated reserve amount. (Sec. 105) Prohibits the FDIC Board of Directors from setting semi-annual assessments in excess of the amount needed to maintain or achieve the designated reserve ratio of a deposit insurance fund. Title II: Status of Banks and Savings Associations - Prescribes procedural guidelines for the termination of Federal savings association charters and their conversion into national bank charters or State depository institution charters. Prohibits the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision from granting any charter for a Federal savings association. Amends the FDIA to treat State Savings Associations as banks for purposes of Federal banking law. (Sec. 202) Amends the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit continuation of grandfathered bank holding company activities and affiliations. (Sec. 203) Sets forth transition provisions for: (1) activities of savings associations and mutual savings associations which have converted into or become treated as banks; and (2) registration of bank holding companies resulting from conversions of savings associations to banks or treatment of savings associations as banks.
