  <summary>3/15/1995--Introduced.
Lowers the amounts under proposed offers to sell defense articles or services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to Saudi Arabia that trigger a requirement by the President to notify the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under the Arms Export Control Act. Makes the lower thresholds that trigger such requirement inapplicable if the Secretary of State certifies to the Congress that the following unpaid claims of American firms against the Government of Saudi Arabia have been resolved satisfactorily: (1) those described in a specified June 30, 1993, report by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1993; or (2) those that are otherwise outstanding before this Act's enactment date and have been litigated fully in the courts of Saudi Arabia but have not been resolved in accordance with standards of fairness as determined by the Secretary of State.</summary>
