Requires the plan to include sites and methods for the safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and the ships' hulls, structures, machinery, and equipment. Prohibits the obligation of any funds for construction of the next nuclear- powered aircraft carrier (CVN-76) until such a plan has been approved by law. Directs the Secretary of Energy to report to the Congress detailing the likelihood and environmental impact of a reactor accident aboard a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress detailing the costs and benefits of the construction of another nuclear-powered aircraft carrier."
