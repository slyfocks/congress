    "text": "Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize States, if requested by an affected local government, to prohibit the disposal of out-of-State municipal solid waste (OSW) in landfills or incinerators subject to their jurisdiction. Permits States to limit the quantity of OSW received at landfills and incinerators excepted from such prohibition to an annual amount equal to or greater than the quantity received during 1993. Authorizes States that imported more than 750,000 tons of OSW in 1993 to limit the amount of such waste received for disposal at landfills and incinerators that are not covered by host community agreements in the importing State as follows: (1) in 1997, 95 percent of the amount exported to the State in 1993; (2) in 1998 through 2003, 95 percent of the amount exported to the State in the previous year; and (3) in 2004 and each succeeding year, 65 percent of the amount exported in 1993. Establishes limitations on waste exports to landfills or incinerators not covered by host community agreements or permits authorizing receipt of OSW. Prohibits States from exercising authorities under this Act: (1) if such action would result in the violation of a host community agreement or a permit issued from the State to receive OSW; or (2) except as otherwise provided, in a manner that would require landfills or incinerators covered by the exception to reduce the amount of OSW received from any State to an annual quantity less than that received during 1993. Makes the authority to prohibit the disposal of OSW inapplicable to landfills and incinerators that: (1) received documented shipments of such waste during 1993; (2) in the case of landfills, are in compliance with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations relating to operation, design and location, leachate collection, groundwater monitoring, and financial assurance for closure and corrective action; or (3) in the case of incinerators, are in compliance with applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act and State laws and regulations relating to facility design and operations. Permits disposal of such waste at facilities that are not in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations unless disposal of waste that is generated within the State is also prohibited. Lists conditions under which host community agreements are prohibited."
