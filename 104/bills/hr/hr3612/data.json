Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 101) Outlines TEA and WF program components, providing for Federal payments to States with approved TEA and WF plans for establishing flexible statewide work-based assistance programs in the State for the following purposes. Provides under TEA for furnishing certain time-limited, conditional benefits based on work to certain eligible families with needy children (or, at the State's option, any expectant family) entering into a personal responsibility agreement with the State setting forth their particular obligations (such as cooperating with the State in the establishment of the paternity of any child born out-of-wedlock for whom assistance is claimed) in order to receive assistance and services under the TEA plan for caring for their children and securing, preferably, a full-time unsubsidized paid job in the private sector, or public sector or volunteer work if necessary, through the WF program. Grants exemptions from such time-limited benefit provision in certain hardship situations. Provides for certain sanctions for refusing to look for work, accept a bona fide offer of employment, or otherwise comply with the personal responsibility agreement. Provides under WF, among other things, for connecting appropriate TEA recipients with the private sector labor market and providing them with the education, training, and other services necessary for them to obtain private sector employment. Gives States the option of: (1) denying TEA to families having additional children while on TEA; and (2) requiring family members to undergo appropriate substance abuse treatment in order to receive TEA. Denies TEA for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators and for ten years for persons found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain assistance in two or more States. Provides for the exchange of certain TEA program information with law enforcement agencies under specified conditions. Lists certain requirements for State TEA plans concerning other programs, including that the State plan require that the State have in effect: (1) a plan approved under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) together with a child support program in substantial compliance with such plan; as well as (2) plans under SSA title IV parts B (Child-Welfare Services) and E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) operating in substantial compliance with the requirements of such parts.
