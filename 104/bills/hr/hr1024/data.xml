  <summary>02/23/1995--Introduced.
Repeals provisions regarding the Joint Committee on Printing. Transfers responsibilities of the Committee to the Public Printer. Directs the Public Printer to: (1) remedy neglect, delay, duplication, and waste in public printing and binding and the production of Government publications; (2) prescribe quality standards; (3) utilize requests for proposals and similar authorized purchasing methods where total or partial migration to new technologies is appropriate or when requested by the user; (4) prescribe Government specifications for printing paper and writing paper; (5) assist with the acquisition and transfer of equipment requisitioned by facilities previously authorized and with the disposal of such equipment; and (6) establish policy for the acquisition of printing and Government publications, formulated to maximize competitive procurement from the private sector (but which may provide for use of Government in-house printing and duplicating operations if they provide printing and duplicating at the lowest cost to the Government). Requires the Public Printer to promulgate rules and regulations for the procurement of printing and Government publications by the Government Printing Office (GPO) not inconsistent with this Act. Mandates that the annual report to the Congress include a report on: (1) the printing costs of each branch of Government; and (2) a cost comparison of printing and publications as procured through GPO, produced by each Federal agency, produced by commercial sources that are not Federal entities under contract with a Federal agency (other than GPO), and produced by commercial sources that are not Federal entities under contract with GPO. Directs the Public Printer to establish and maintain the following separate GPO accounts: (1) Superintendent of Documents; (2) Executive and Judicial Print Procurement; and (3) Congressional Services. Requires that all printing and Government publications for the Congress, the executive office, the judiciary (other than the Supreme Court), and every executive department, agency, independent office and establishment or Government entity be procured from private sector commercial entities by GPO, with exceptions. Revises provisions regarding: (1) competitive procurement; (2) limits on Government printing production; (3) the use of illustrations; (4) the form and style of work for departments. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) departmental distribution of publications; (2) availability, inventory, dissemination, and re-publication of Government publications; (3) projections and reporting on costs for printing by Federal agencies; (4) scoring of sales of assets; (5) "Buy American" requirements; and (6) cost ceilings for certain congressional documents.</summary>
