  <summary>1/11/1995--Introduced.
Nuclear Waste Policy Reassessment Act of 1993 (sic)- Prohibits any expenditure from the Nuclear Waste Fund during FY 1994 through 1998 for site characterization of the Yucca Mountain site (Nevada). Directs the National Academy of Sciences to study and report to the Congress on scientific means for determining a suitable repository location for the permanent deep geologic disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to change: (1) from January 31, 1998, to January 31, 2003, the deadline by which the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) must dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (2) from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2015, the deadline by which the Secretary must report to the Congress and the President on the need for a second repository. Directs the Secretary to establish a rebate and credit procedure in order to offset the construction and operation expenses for any additional spent nuclear fuel storage capacity at a civilian nuclear power reactor which is required due to (or in anticipation of) the postponement of Federal responsibility. Terminates the rebate and credit program after the Secretary begins to accept spent nuclear fuel at an authorized storage or disposal facility.</summary>
