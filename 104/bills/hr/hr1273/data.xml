  <summary>3/21/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 to provide that an employer does not have to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation to an employee for or on account of such employee's voluntary use of employer-owned vehicles for traveling not more than 30 miles to the actual place of performance of the first principal activity which such employee is employed to perform (thus relieving the employer of liability and punishment, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Walsh-Healey Act, and Davis-Bacon Act, for failure to pay such wage or compensation for the time of such use).</summary>
