Sets guidelines for proceeding against a juvenile in Federal court as a juvenile and as an adult. (Sec. 102) Modifies provisions regarding: (1) custody prior to appearance before a magistrate to provide that whenever a juvenile is taken into custody, the arresting officer shall immediately advise such juvenile of the juvenile's rights and promptly take reasonable steps to notify the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian (and directs that the juvenile be taken before a judicial officer without unreasonable delay); and (2) detention prior to disposition to direct that a juvenile be detained in such suitable place as the Attorney General may designate, with preference for a location within, or a reasonable distance of, the district in which the juvenile is being prosecuted (and sets forth provisions regarding the place and conditions of detention). (Sec. 105) Extends from 30 to 45 days the period during which an alleged delinquent who is in detention pending trial must be brought to trial. (Sec. 106) Modifies provisions regarding dispositional hearings to direct the court, upon finding a juvenile to be a juvenile delinquent, to hold a hearing concerning the appropriate disposition of the juvenile no later than 40 court days (currently, 20) after such finding. Directs that: (1) a predisposition report be prepared by the probation officer; (2) victim impact information be included in the report and victims be provided the opportunity to make a statement to the court or present information relating to disposition; and (3) the court impose an appropriate sanction. Directs the Attorney General to develop a list of possible sanctions for juveniles adjudicated delinquent. (Sec. 107) Revises provisions regarding juvenile records to require that: (1) the court keep a record relating to the arrest and adjudication that is equal to an adult arrest and conviction record and retained for an equal period; and (2) such records be made available for official purposes, including communications with victims or school officials. Directs the Attorney General to establish guidelines for juvenile fingerprinting and photographing. (Sec. 108) Modifies provisions regarding commitment to prohibit the Attorney General from causing any juvenile under age 19 adjudicated delinquent to be placed or retained in an adult correctional facility in which the juvenile has regular contact with adults incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges, except for placement in a community-based facility. (Sec. 110) Makes acts of juvenile delinquency that would be a serious drug offense if committed by an adult a predicate offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Title II: Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Armed Violent Predators - Revises the Federal criminal code to provide for mandatory prison terms for possessing, brandishing, or discharging (currently, limited to using or carrying) a firearm or destructive device during a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime. Establishes penalties for second or subsequent convictions. Bars the court from imposing probationary sentences or concurrent terms of imprisonment on persons convicted of such violations. Title III: Armed Violent Youth Predator Apprehension Directive - Directs the Attorney General to establish an armed violent youth predator apprehension program under which each U.S. Attorney shall: (1) designate at least one assistant U.S. Attorney to prosecute armed violent youth predators; and (2) establish an armed youth predator criminal apprehension task force. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) reporting requirements; and (2) waivers. Title IV: Block Grants and Incentive Grants for Accountability- Based Reforms - Revises Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974: (1) findings to specify that juvenile delinquency requires action by Federal, State, and local governments (currently, the Federal Government); and (2) purposes to include assisting State and local governments in promoting public safety by improving the openness of the juvenile justice system, encouraging the identification of violent and hard-core juveniles and transferring them into adult criminal court jurisdiction, and providing resources to States to build or expand juvenile detention facilities. (Sec. 403) Redesignates the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention as the Office Of Juvenile Crime Control (Office). (Sec. 404) Revises the Act to authorize: (1) specified initiatives, including improving juvenile court and law enforcement records (including fingerprints and photographs); and (2) the Office Administrator to use specified funds to establish and maintain a clearinghouse regarding juvenile delinquency prevention, treatment, and control and to provide training and technical assistance to improve State juvenile justice system administration. (Sec. 405) Repeals provisions regarding: (1) allocations and State plans, including provision for an advisory group; and (2) National Programs, Gang-Free Schools and Communities, State Challenge Activities, Treatment for Juvenile Offenders who are Victims of Child Abuse or Neglect, Mentoring, Boot Camps, and a White House Conference on Juvenile Justice. (Sec. 408) Directs the Administrator to provide juvenile delinquent accountability grants to States that ensure that juveniles who commit an act after attaining age 14 that would be a serious violent crime if committed by an adult are treated as adults for prosecution purposes. Makes such States eligible for additional sums upon demonstrating compliance with specified \"accountability-based juvenile crime control practices.\" (Sec. 409) Authorizes appropriations. Specifies that the source of such appropriations may be the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund."
