Amends Federal armed forces provisions to: (1) make persons who willfully misclassify an individual for purposes of any employment tax ineligible for any defense contract; (2) require a person who submits a bid or proposal for a defense contract to certify that the amount of the bid or proposal is adequate to pay all employment taxes with respect to all work to be performed under the contract by the contractor's employees; (3) require each defense contract to include a requirement that the contractor provide certain notifications to each person who performs work under the contract and who is treated as an independent contractor for purposes of employment taxes; and (4) allow a person who submits a bid or proposal for a defense contract and who suffers damages as a result of the award of the contract to a person who knowingly and willfully submits a false certification to bring an action for damages against the person awarded the contract in any U.S. district court in which the defendant is located.</summary>
