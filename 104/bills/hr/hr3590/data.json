    "text": "Victims of Domestic Abuse Insurance Protection Act of 1996 - Prohibits insurers and group health plans from engaging, directly or indirectly, in specified discriminatory acts or practices on the basis that the applicant or insured, or any person employed by the applicant or insured or with whom the applicant or insured has a relationship or association, or a beneficiary or plan participant, is, has been, or may be the subject of domestic abuse. Sets forth limitations upon the use or transfer of information among insurers or group health plans with respect to such subjects. Requires the insurer or group health plan to furnish a written explanation of any adverse action taken on a claim or medical condition that the insurer has reason to know is abuse-related. Prescribes parameters within which a life insurer may decline to issue a life insurance policy on the life of an individual if the applicant or prospective policy owner is or would be the designated beneficiary, and if such applicant or prospective policy owner: (1) lacks an insurable interest in the insured; or (2) is known in police or court records to have committed an act of domestic abuse in relation to the individual. Prohibits subrogation of claims resulting from domestic abuse without the informed consent of the subject of domestic abuse. Mandates that: (1) an insurer develop protocols specifying how employees, agents, and brokers will pursue an insurance action that may affect the safety of a subject of domestic abuse involved with that action; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services promulgate standards for insurers to implement this Act if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners fails to adopt a Model Act that establishes standards to implement this Act. Prescribes guidelines for State and Federal enforcement of this Act, including a civil money penalty for violations."
