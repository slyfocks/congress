    "text": "Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants Act of 1995 - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to replace provisions of title I setting forth the Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 with a local law enforcement block grant program. Requires the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to pay to qualifying local governments specified sums for reducing crime and improving public safety, including for: (1) hiring, training, and employing on a continuing basis new, additional law enforcement officers and support personnel; (2) paying overtime to increase the number of hours worked by presently employed officers and support personnel; (3) procuring equipment, technology, and other material directly related to basic law enforcement functions; (4) enhancing security measures in and around schools and any other facility or location which is considered by the unit of local government to have a special risk for incidents of crime; (5) establishing crime prevention programs that may involve, though not exclusively, law enforcement officials and that are intended to discourage, disrupt, or interfere with the commission of criminal activity; (6) establishing or supporting drug courts; (7) establishing early intervention and prevention programs for juveniles to reduce or eliminate crime; (8) enhancing the adjudication process of cases involving violent offenders, including the adjudication process of cases involving violent juvenile offenders; (9) enhancing programs under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 drug control and system improvement grant program; (10) establishing cooperative task forces between adjoining local governments to work cooperatively to prevent and combat criminal activity, particularly criminal activity that is exacerbated by drug- or gang-related involvement; and (11) establishing a multijurisdictional task force, particularly in rural areas, composed of law enforcement officials representing local governments, that works with Federal law enforcement officials to prevent and control crime. Prohibits a local government from expending any of the funds provided under this Act to purchase, lease, rent, or otherwise acquire tanks or armored personnel carriers, fixed wing aircraft, limousines, real estate, yachts, consultants, or vehicles not primarily used for law enforcement unless the Attorney General certifies that extraordinary and exigent circumstances exist that make the use of funds for such purposes essential to the maintenance of public safety and good order. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the timing of payments; (2) payment adjustments; (3) reservation of sums for adjustments; (4) repayment of unexpended amounts; (5) requirements that such funds not be used to supplant State or local funds; (6) matching funds; (7) oversight accountability and administration; and (8) technology assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the Director to: (1) establish procedures under which a local government is required to provide notice to the Director regarding the proposed use of funds made available under this Act; and (2) establish a process for the ongoing evaluation of projects developed with funds made available under this title. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) general qualification requirements; (2) sanctions for noncompliance; (3) maintenance of effort requirements; (4) the allocation and distribution of funds, including resolution of disparate allocations and unavailability and inaccuracy of information; (5) the use of funds to contract with private, nonprofit entities or community-based organizations; and (6) public participation. Repeals provisions of VCCLEA regarding: (1) the Ounce of Prevention Council; (2) local crime prevention block grants; (3) model intensive block grants; (4) family and community endeavor schools grants; (5) assistance for delinquent and at-risk youth; (6) police retirement; (7) the Local Partnership Act; (8) the National Community Economic Partnership; (9) urban recreation and at-risk youth; (10) community-based justice grants for prosecutors; (11) the family unity demonstration project; and (12) gang resistance and education training."
