    "text": "Employee Commuting Flexibility Act of 1996 - Amends the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 to provide that an employer does not have to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation to an employee for or on account of such employee's use of employer-owned vehicles for traveling for commuting purposes, if such use is: (1) within the normal commuting area for the employer's business or establishment; and (2) subject to an agreement on the part of the employer and the employee or employee representative. Considers such commuting use, and activities incidental to it, as not part of the employee's principal activities, thus relieving the employer of liability and punishment, under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, Walsh-Healey Act, and Davis-Bacon Act, for failure to pay such wage or compensation for the time of such use. Minimum Wage Increase Act of 1996 - Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the minimum wage rate from the current $4.25 per hour to: (1) $4.75 per hour during the year beginning on June 30, 1996; and (2) $5.15 per hour after that year. Amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements certain computer professionals who are compensated at a rate of not less than $27.63 per hour. Revises provisions relating to the tip credit for determining the minimum wage for tipped employees. Allows an employer to pay less than the minimum wage (as increased by this Act, but not less than $4.25 per hour) to any employee who is less than 20 years old, during the first 90 consecutive calendar days after such employee is hired."
