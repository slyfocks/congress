Requires the President, in every possible instance, to consult with the Congress before introducing the armed forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated and to consult regularly with the Congress until such forces are no longer engaged in such hostilities or have been removed from such situations. Directs the President, in the absence of a declaration of war, to report to the Congress in any case in which the armed forces are introduced: (1) into hostilities or situations described above; (2) into the territory, airspace, or waters of a foreign nation while equipped for combat, with specified exceptions; or (3) in numbers which substantially enlarge armed forces equipped for combat already located in a foreign nation. Requires such report to set forth: (1) the circumstances necessitating such introduction; (2) the constitutional and legislative authority under which such introduction took place; and (3) the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or involvement. Provides for continuing reports to the Congress as long as the armed forces are so engaged."
