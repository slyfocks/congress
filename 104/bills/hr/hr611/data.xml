  <summary>1/20/1995--Introduced.
Free and Independent Cuba Assistance Act - Requires the President, at such time as a transition government is in power in Cuba, to develop a plan for providing economic assistance to Cuba while such government or a democratic government is in power. Limits assistance for a transition government to humanitarian assistance, specified assistance comparable to that provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for the economic and democratic development of the independent states of the former Soviet Union, and military adjustment assistance. Expands assistance to include development and agricultural assistance and export financing (as well as other specified assistance) when a democratic government is in power. Requires the President to take steps to obtain the agreement of other countries, international financial institutions, and multilateral organizations to provide comparable assistance to Cuba. Directs the President to determine whether to designate Cuba as a beneficiary country pursuant to the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. Requires the President to seek to enter into preliminary agreements with a transition government in Cuba providing for trade with and investment in Cuba. Authorizes the President to enter into negotiations with a democratic government in Cuba to provide for the extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement to Cuba and to encourage renewed investment in Cuba. Directs the President to communicate the plan for assistance to the Cuban people. Authorizes appropriations. Requires the President to terminate the trade embargo on Cuba upon submitting a determination that a democratic government is in power in Cuba to the Congress. Sets forth conditions under which a government in Cuba will be considered transitional or democratic.</summary>
