  <summary>5/23/1996--Introduced.
ATM Public Safety and Crime Control Act of 1996 - Amends the Bank Protection Act of 1978 to direct each Federal banking supervisory agency to prescribe specified lighting and surveillance camera security measures at depository institutions based upon recommendations made by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Amends the Judicial Code to instruct the Director to: (1) periodically review crime prevention standards and procedures at financial institutions; (2) make technical recommendations to the Federal banking agencies; and (3) submit copies of such recommendations to congressional judiciary committees. Requires consultation with the Attorney General to ascertain the extent to which inadequate security measures, or improperly maintained security equipment, at financial institutions have hindered effective prosecutions for bank robbery and incidental crimes. Sets a timetable for: (1) promulgation of final Federal regulations pursuant to the Director's recommendations; and (2) depository institution compliance with such regulations.</summary>
