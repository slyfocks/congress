Provides for the continuation of service of the Secretary of Energy as the interim Administrator. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the Administrator to establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue in the Energy Programs Resolution Agency any organizational entities that were entities of DOE. Sunsets the Agency three years after the date of enactment of this Act. Directs the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on the most efficient way to accomplish the complete abolishment of DOE and the transfer or termination of its functions. Title II: Energy Laboratory Facilities - Establishes the Energy Laboratory Facilities Commission to privatize and reduce energy laboratories and programs. Prescribes procedural guidelines. (Sec. 205) Establishes the Energy Laboratory Facility Closure Account to fund implementation of such guidelines. Title III: Privatization of Federal Power Marketing Administrations - Federal Power Asset Privatization Act of 1995 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to sell, at the highest possible price, all Federal electric power generation and transmission facilities supervised by, or coordinated with, the Federal Power Marketing Administrations (except the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)). Restricts such sales to domestic entities or U.S. citizens. Requires the Secretary to terminate Federal Power Marketing Administration operations (except those of the BPA) upon completion of the sales. Directs the Secretary to retain a private sector firm through a competitive bidding process to serve as financial advisor with respect to such sales. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the purchaser of any such facilities should offer to employ former Federal Power Marketing Administration personnel. Mandates that sale proceeds be deposited into the Treasury. Sets forth a sales completion deadline for each Power Marketing Administration concerned. (Sec. 305) Mandates that the pertinent sales agreements require each purchaser providing electric power to customers within any region to insure that the price of electric power does not increase above the baseline price at a rate greater than ten percent annually. (Sec. 306) Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue to the purchaser of a hydroelectric generation facility a ten-year original license under the Federal Power Act to insure that the project will continue operations under the same conditions as were applicable prior to the sale. Grants FERC Federal Power Act jurisdiction over any such facility sold. (Sec. 307) Amends the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1993 to repeal the proscription against the use of appropriated funds for studies regarding a changeover from an \"at cost\" to a \"market rate\" or other noncost-based methodology for pricing hydroelectric power. (Sec. 308) Transfers to the Secretary of the Interior all DOE functions affecting the BPA. Instructs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the most cost-effective option of disposing of the BPA. Title IV: Transfer and Disposal of Reserves - Transfers to the Secretary of the Interior all former DOE functions affecting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Instructs the Secretary to: (1) sell the reserves held at Weeks Island, Louisiana; (2) appoint an advisory board to monitor the sale of such reserves and report to the Congress on whether the United States should maintain or dispose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. (Sec. 402) Directs the Secretary of Energy to: (1) transfer jurisdiction and control over naval petroleum reserves to the Department of the Interior; and (2) sell all Federal right, title, and interest in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk Hills). (Sec. 403) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to the Congress on the most cost-effective options for other Federal interests in naval petroleum reserves. Title V: National Security and Environmental Management Programs - Subtitle A: Defense Nuclear Programs Agency - Establishes the Defense Nuclear Programs Agency (the Agency) in the Department of Defense (DOD), headed by an Under Secretary for Defense Nuclear Programs (the Under Secretary) with primary responsibility for defense nuclear programs. (Sec. 504) Transfers to the Under Secretary all supervisory functions previously performed by: (1) DOE over Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories; (2) Defense Nuclear Agency of DOD relating to nuclear weapons systems; and (3) the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer other nuclear weapons-related functions to the Under Secretary. (Sec. 505) Places restrictions upon the transfer of funds by the Agency. Subtitle B: Environmental Restoration Activities at Defense Nuclear Facilities - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to require the Under Secretary to review ongoing and planned remediation activities consistent with this Act. (Sec. 521) Sets forth guidelines for site-specific risk assessment before the selection of a remedial action at a defense nuclear facility which include an analysis of risk reduction benefits and costs. (Sec. 523) Instructs the Under Secretary to renegotiate the terms of any compliance agreement entered into with the Secretary of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the relevant State in order to have it reflect this Act. Title VI: Disposition of Miscellaneous Particular Programs, Functions, and Agencies of Department - Limits authorizations for enumerated energy research and development programs through FY 2000. (Sec. 601) Directs the Energy Laboratory Facilities Commission to identify for the Congress all DOE research and development activities carried out at energy laboratories or institutions of higher education that perform a critical research function important to the long-term economic well-being of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Energy to terminate all DOE clean coal technology research and development activities. Authorizes appropriations for DOE fossil energy and energy conservation research and development activities. Terminates such activities at the end of FY 1998. Transfers from DOE to DOD specified: (1) weapons activities; and (2) materials support and other defense programs. (Sec. 602) Transfers to the Department of the Treasury all functions performed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Authorizes appropriations for the EIA. Transfers to the Attorney General all functions performed by the Energy Regulatory Administration. Title VII: Civilian Radioactive Waste Management - Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to terminate the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management and transfer its authority and assets to the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps). Provides that the Corps shall assume all obligations of the Office affecting the Yucca Mountain site, and that Nevada State permits shall be reissued for the Corps. Prescribes procedural guidelines for Corps preparation and implementation of a Yucca Mountain site characterization plan. Title VIII: Miscellaneous Provisions - Sets forth miscellaneous implementing provisions, conferring upon the Office of Management and Budget the authority to make any determination regarding functions transferred under this Act and incidental transfers."
