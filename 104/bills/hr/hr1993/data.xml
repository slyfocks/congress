(Sec. 306) Directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue to the purchaser of a hydroelectric generation facility a ten-year original license under the Federal Power Act to insure that the project will continue operations under the same conditions as were applicable prior to the sale. Grants FERC Federal Power Act jurisdiction over any such facility sold. (Sec. 307) Amends the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 1993 to repeal the proscription against the use of appropriated funds for studies regarding a changeover from an "at cost" to a "market rate" or other noncost-based methodology for pricing hydroelectric power. (Sec. 308) Transfers to the Secretary of the Interior all DOE functions affecting the BPA. Instructs the Secretary to study and report to the Congress on the most cost-effective option of disposing of the BPA. Title IV: Transfer and Disposal of Reserves - Transfers to the Secretary of the Interior all former DOE functions affecting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

(Sec. 403) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to study and report to the Congress on the most cost-effective options for other Federal interests in naval petroleum reserves. Title V: National Security and Environmental Management Programs - Subtitle A: Defense Nuclear Programs Agency - Establishes the Defense Nuclear Programs Agency (the Agency) in the Department of Defense (DOD), headed by an Under Secretary for Defense Nuclear Programs (the Under Secretary) with primary responsibility for defense nuclear programs. (Sec. 504) Transfers to the Under Secretary all supervisory functions previously performed by: (1) DOE over Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories; (2) Defense Nuclear Agency of DOD relating to nuclear weapons systems; and (3) the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board. Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer other nuclear weapons-related functions to the Under Secretary. (Sec. 505) Places restrictions upon the transfer of funds by the Agency. Subtitle B: Environmental Restoration Activities at Defense Nuclear Facilities - Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to require the Under Secretary to review ongoing and planned remediation activities consistent with this Act. (Sec. 521) Sets forth guidelines for site-specific risk assessment before the selection of a remedial action at a defense nuclear facility which include an analysis of risk reduction benefits and costs. (Sec. 523) Instructs the Under Secretary to renegotiate the terms of any compliance agreement entered into with the Secretary of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the relevant State in order to have it reflect this Act. Title VI: Disposition of Miscellaneous Particular Programs, Functions, and Agencies of Department - Limits authorizations for enumerated energy research and development programs through FY 2000. (Sec. 601) Directs the Energy Laboratory Facilities Commission to identify for the Congress all DOE research and development activities carried out at energy laboratories or institutions of higher education that perform a critical research function important to the long-term economic well-being of the United States. Directs the Secretary of Energy to terminate all DOE clean coal technology research and development activities. Authorizes appropriations for DOE fossil energy and energy conservation research and development activities. Terminates such activities at the end of FY 1998.
