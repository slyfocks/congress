Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a clearinghouse through which interested parties may receive information and technical assistance on the establishment and operation of such centers. Amends the Public Health Service Act to provide for grants to public and nonprofit private entities for school-based health centers. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
