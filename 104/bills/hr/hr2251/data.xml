Requires the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) amend a specified water contract between the United States and Kingman, Arizona, dated November 14, 1968, to extend such contract until December 31, 2001; (2) upon request by the city, approve the assignment of the contract from the city to a municipal corporation in Mohave County, Arizona; and (3) after such assignment, amend the contract to make water deliverable under it available for permanent service in a manner that is consistent with a specified plan submitted by the city to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on June 29, 1994. Prohibits the contract from being terminable for nonuse of water before December 31, 2001, and thereafter, only in accordance with the terms of the contract as amended pursuant to this Act.
