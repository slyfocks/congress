Ratifies prior transfers of real property (and improvements thereon) or natural resources located anywhere within the United States from, by, or on behalf of the Tribe. Extinguishes aboriginal title, rights, interest, and claims by the Tribe and other Indians. Bars the United States from asserting any future claim arising by or on behalf of the Tribe from the transfer or conveyance of any real property (and improvements thereon) or natural resources before the enactment of this Act. Requires the Tribe to submit to the Secretary of the Interior its base membership roll. Allows the Tribe to elect to organize a tribal government under the Indian Reorganization Act and adopt any new constitution or other organic law in accordance with such Act."
