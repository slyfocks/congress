Revised Statutes 2477 Rights-of-Way Settlement Act - Authorizes any State, political subdivision thereof, or other holder of a right-of-way across public lands that was granted under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes before the enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, or any person who uses or could use the right-of-way for passage across such lands to access property in which such person has an interest, to file with the appropriate Secretary of the Department concerned a notice of the right-of-way. Directs the Secretary to notify the holder (or other party giving notice) of the recognition or objections of the Secretary to the right-of-way or any portion thereof within two years or the right-of-way shall be deemed to be valid. Allows the Secretary to bring an action to challenge the validity of the right-of-way in a U.S. district court within two years after notifying a holder of objections or the right-of-way shall be deemed to be valid. Permits a holder to bring an action to quiet title with respect to such a right-of-way within the later of: (1) 12 years from the date of notice of objection from the Secretary; or (2) the termination of the limitations period applicable under the Federal judicial code. Prohibits the Secretary from closing any right-of-way in use before October 21, 1976: (1) until one year after providing notice to the appropriate State or subdivision; or (2) if closure would leave any adjoining non-Federal lands without an established public or private access.</summary>
