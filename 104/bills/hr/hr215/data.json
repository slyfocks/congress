Reduces discretionary spending limits by amounts transferred to the Fund. Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require that amounts resulting from reduced spending under general appropriations bills be placed in the Fund. Requires the Congressional Budget Office to score all general appropriations measures as passed by the House and Senate and to publish such scorecard in the Congressional Record. Title II: Miscellaneous Amendments to the Rules of the House of Representatives - Amends rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives to prohibit the Committee on Rules from reporting any rule for the consideration of a measure commonly known as a \"king of the hill\" rule. Repeals rule XLIX (statutory limit on the public debt). Amends rule XXVIII to prohibit conference committee reports from funding any program or activity at a level higher than that contained in the bill or resolution as passed by the House or Senate or from funding any program not contained in such versions. Title III: Economic and Employment Impact Statements - Requires the Comptroller General to prepare an economic and employment impact statement to accompany each bill, resolution, or conference report reported by a committee or considered on the floor. Makes it out of order to consider any legislation that is not accompanied by such statement unless the point of order is waived by a two-thirds vote. Requires regulations and proposed regulations promulgated by Federal agencies to be accompanied by such statements as well. Title IV: Applicability of Freedom of Information Act - Applies the Freedom of Information Act to the Congress as such Act applies to executive agencies."
