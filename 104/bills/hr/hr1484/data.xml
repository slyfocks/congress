  <summary>4/7/1995--Introduced.
Public Safety Employer-Employee Relations Act of 1995 - Provides collective bargaining rights for public safety officers employed by States or local governments. (Sec. 4) Declares that fire fighters and law enforcement officers have the right to self-organize, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. Applies this Act to any State and its local governments if such entity does not have a law or ordinance that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of fire fighters and law enforcement officers as established under this Act. Grants employers or employee labor organizations the right to petition the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to determine whether a State or local government is in compliance. Provides that existing collective bargaining units and agreements shall not be invalidated by this Act. Provides for conciliation of labor disputes involving fire fighters and law enforcement officers. Requires the Director, when the FMCS certifies an impasse, to establish a Board of Inquiry to investigate the issues in the dispute and report its findings and recommendations. Provides for enforcement of this Act through the appropriate U.S. District Court. Provides that a State is not immune from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this Act. (Sec. 5) Prohibits public safety employers and employees from engaging in lockouts or strikes. (Sec. 6) Sets forth provisions for suits by and against labor organizations representing public safety officers. (Sec. 7) Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
