Makes an article eligible for such exemption only if: (1) its importer certifies that the article meets the exemption conditions; and (2) when requested by the Customs Service, the importer, manufacturer, or exporter submits a declaration setting forth all pertinent information with respect to such article and the requirements of this Act. Authorizes the President to: (1) treat such articles as items of Israel for purposes of the free trade agreement entered into between the United States and Israel in 1985, as long as such articles otherwise meet agreement requirements; and (2) include the value of materials and processing costs of such articles as values and costs under such agreement."
