  <summary>9/26/1996--Introduced.
Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act of 1996 - Provides that, upon motion of the United States, any person found guilty of a criminal violation of specified Federal environmental laws, or conspiracy to violate such laws, may be ordered to pay the costs incurred by a State, local, or tribal government or an agency thereof for assistance to the Federal Government's investigation and criminal prosecution of the case, with the payments used solely for environmental law enforcement. Imposes penalties upon individuals and organizations that commit a criminal violation of listed Federal environmental laws which causes "serious bodily injury" to or the death of any other person, including a Federal, State, local, or tribal government employee performing official duties as a result of the violation. Environmental Crimes Training Act of 1996 - Directs the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish within EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance a State, Local, and Tribal Enforcement Training Program to train State, local, and tribal law enforcement personnel in the investigation of environmental crimes. Sets a five-year statute of limitations (longer in cases of concealment of the offense by an affirmative act) for violation of, or a conspiracy to violate, specified Federal environmental laws. Amends various Federal environmental laws to cover attempts to engage in proscribed conduct. Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize the court to order restitution for listed Federal environmental crimes, including, in the case of an offense resulting in pollution of or damage to the environment, payment for removal and remediation of the pollution or damage and restoration of the environment. Defines "victim" of the offense in such cases to include a community or communities, whether or not the members are individually identified. Authorizes the court to issue prejudgment orders to prevent alienation or disposal of assets needed to remedy environmental harms caused by environmental crimes.</summary>
