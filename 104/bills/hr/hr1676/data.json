Exempts expenses of administering the old age, survivors and disability insurance programs from sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman Hollings Act). Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to require the congressional budget resolution to set forth separately an estimate of benefit payments under the OASDI programs for the fiscal year and each of the two ensuing fiscal years. Amends the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 to make it out of order in the House of Representatives to consider any bill or joint resolution which would appropriate funds for a fiscal year which exceeds 1.5 percent of the estimate of benefit payments for such OASDI programs for the fiscal year set forth in the most recently agreed to congressional budget resolution."
