  <summary>6/27/1995--Passed House amended.
Makes a veteran exposed to herbicides in Vietnam during the Vietnam era eligible for hospital and nursing home care for any disease for which the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), in a report issued under the Agent Orange Act of 1991, has determined that: (1) there is sufficient evidence to conclude a positive association between the occurrence of the disease and exposure to a herbicide; (2) there is evidence suggestive of such an association, though the evidence is limited; or (3) available studies are insufficient to permit such a conclusion. Makes such veterans eligible for such care also for a disease for which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, pursuant to a recommendation of the Under Secretary for Health based on peer-reviewed research studies published after the most recent NAS report, determines that there is credible evidence suggestive of an association between disease occurrence and herbicide exposure. Makes a veteran exposed to radiation during a period of active duty for training or inactive duty training eligible for hospital and nursing home care for: (1) any diseases currently listed in Federal provisions which presume a relation between such disease and a veteran's disability; or (2) any disease for which the Secretary determines there is credible evidence of a positive association between the occurrence of such disease and exposure to ionizing radiation. Extends through December 31, 1997, the authorized period for the provision of hospital, nursing home, and outpatient care for certain veterans, including those herbicide- or radiation-exposed veterans described in this Act.</summary>
