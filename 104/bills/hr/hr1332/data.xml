(Sec. 5) Amends Federal law to repeal the requirement that the Delegate to Congress from Guam be elected by a separate ballot. (Sec. 6) Amends Federal law to declare that certain Federal grant assistance to American Samoa shall be considered local revenues when used as the local share required to obtain Federal programs and services. (Sec. 7) Repeals the mandate that the Secretary of the Interior transfer administration of the American Memorial Park (in Saipan) to the Government of the Northern Mariana Islands. (Sec. 8) Establishes the American Samoa Study Commission to: (1) evaluate the history and nature of American Samoa's political relationship with the United States; (2) evaluate the impact of the relationship on the economic and social needs of American Samoa; (3) report on how the 1900 and 1904 instruments of cession to the United States of islands that compose American Samoa are recognized under international law; and (4) report on options available to improve American Samoa's economic self-sufficiency.
