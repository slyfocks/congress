  <summary>4/6/1995--Introduced.
Department of Transportation Reorganization Act of 1995 - Amends Federal transportation law to increase the number of Department of Transportation (DOT) Assistant Secretaries to five. (Sec. 4) Repeals a provision granting the Secretary of Transportation supervisory authority over the Saint Lawrence Seaway Corporation. Establishes the Intermodal Transportation Administration (ITA) as an administration within the DOT, headed by an Administrator appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Establishes within the Administration an Office of Intermodalism which shall: (1) develop and disseminate intermodal transportation data through the Bureau of Transportation Statistics; (2) coordinate the collection of intermodal transportation data for a data base with States and metropolitan planning organizations; and (3) coordinate Federal research on intermodal transportation in accordance with a specified plan developed under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Authorizes the Secretary to delegate his or her authority over the Saint Lawrence Seaway Corporation to the ITA Administrator. Amends the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 to repeal provisions under such Act relating to the establishment of the Office of Intermodalism within the Office of the Secretary. Amends the Ports and Waterways Safety Act to make the Secretary (instead of the Secretary in the department in which the Coast Guard is operating) solely responsible for the prevention of damage to, or destruction of, bridges over U.S. navigable waters. (Sec. 5) Amends Federal transportation law to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to carry out duties related to commercial space transportation. (Sec. 6) Repeals specified provisions relating to: (1) the Federal Railroad Administration; (2) the Federal Highway Administration; (3) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; (4) the Federal Transit Administration; (5) the Maritime Administration; and (6) the Research and Special Programs Administration. (Sec. 7) Authorizes the Secretary, in carrying out DOT functions, to make, enter into, and perform contracts, grants, leases, cooperative agreements, cooperative research and development agreements, and other similar transactions with Federal, State, and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, and private organizations and persons. Authorizes the Secretary to accept reimbursement from non-Federal sources for costs related to the participation of non-Federal individuals incurred by the DOT for international trips related to promoting international trade in U.S. goods and services. (Sec. 8) Repeals the mandates for specified reports, and revises the due dates for certain other reports.</summary>
