TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Federal Juvenile Proceedings Title II: Grant Program for at Risk Juveniles Juvenile Crime Avoidance and Prevention Act of 1996 - Title I: Federal Juvenile Proceedings - Amends the Federal criminal code to require an appropriate Federal authority (designated by the Attorney General), before any decision is made to proceed against a juvenile as a juvenile or as an adult, or to refer the juvenile to State authorities, to perform an initial intake screening to determine whether that juvenile is an at risk juvenile. Requires a juvenile who is determined to be at risk and who is proceeded against as a juvenile to be referred to a youth development specialist. Provides that if a juvenile is referred to State authorities for further proceedings or transferred for prosecution as an adult, the results of the screening shall be made available to those authorities or to the entity to which the juvenile is so transferred. Requires the screening body to determine that a juvenile is at risk if it determines that the juvenile is likely to exhibit recidivist or increasingly violent crimes, based on specified factors. Limits the use of such determination. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) the qualifications and duties of the youth development specialist, including determining a course of action for the juvenile that will avoid continued criminal activity and monitoring the juvenile's progress through the court system; and (2) data collection and dissemination by the Attorney General. Title II: Grant Program for At Risk Juveniles - Directs the Attorney General to award: (1) grants to an entity that has implemented specified at risk juvenile screening programs and youth development specialist referral services; and (2) not more than $10,000 each year for each juvenile that receives services to an entity that meets the requirements of this title. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) eligibility; and (2) permissible uses of grant funds. Authorizes appropriations. Specifies that funds authorized may be appropriated from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund.</summary>
