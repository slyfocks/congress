Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) obligate funds for a grant with respect to a building or structure listed on, or eligible for listing on, the National Register of Historic Places only if the grantee agrees to match the amount of such grant with funds derived from non-Federal sources; and (2) waive this matching requirement if an extreme emergency exists or if such a waiver is in the public interest to assure the preservation of historically significant resources. Earmarks funds for grants to: (1) Fisk University; (2) Knoxville College; (3) Miles College, Alabama; (4) Talladega College, Alabama; (5) Selma University, Alabama; (6) Stillman College, Alabama; (7) Concordia College, Alabama; (8) Allen University, South Carolina; (9) Claflin College, South Carolina; (10) Voorhees College, South Carolina; (11) Rust College, Mississippi; and (12) Tougaloo University, Mississippi."
