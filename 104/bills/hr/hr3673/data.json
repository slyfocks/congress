(Sec. 102) Considers any veteran age 65 or older and a patient in a nursing home as totally and permanently disabled for purposes of eligibility for veterans' disability compensation. (Sec. 103) Authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a pilot program under which veterans' medical disability evaluation examinations may be made under contract by persons other than employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Sec. 104) Reduces the annual clothing allowance for veterans who are incarcerated and furnished clothing by the penal institution. (Sec. 105) Amends the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1994 to extend the due date for a final report from the Veterans' Claims Adjudication Commission concerning the disposition of claims for veterans' benefits. Provides funding. Title II: Education and Other Readjustment Benefits - Repeals provisions prohibiting the Secretary from approving the enrollment of an eligible veteran or other person in a course offered at an educational institution when such institution has been in operation for less than two years. Prohibits the Secretary from approving enrollment in a course not leading to a standard college degree when: (1) the institution or branch thereof offering the course has been operating for less than two years; or (2) following either a change in ownership or a move, the institution does not retain substantially the same faculty, student body, and courses. Provides for the approval or disapproval of courses offered by an institution under contract. Revises approval requirements concerning the adequacy of student records. (Sec. 202) Eliminates the distinction between the pursuit of education by open circuit television and independent study for purposes of the computation of the educational assistance allowance provided. (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Secretary to approve the pursuit of flight training if, among other requirements, the individual possesses a valid private pilot's license and meets the medical requirements for a commercial pilot's license on the first day of such training and within 60 days after successfully completing such training. (Sec. 204) Repeals a provision limiting the monthly educational assistance allowance payable to an individual pursuing a cooperative program. Increases the monthly educational allowance provided to individuals pursuing training in a business or industrial establishment as part of a full-time education program. (Sec. 205) Extends through 1997 the authority of the Secretary to issue certificates or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of veterans' mortgage loans guaranteed by the Department. (Sec. 206) Amends the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act to extend through FY 1999 the authority for veterans' reintegration projects. Title III: Other Matters - Authorizes the American Battle Monuments Commission to enter into arrangements for the repair and long-term maintenance of war memorials. Establishes in the Treasury a fund for such repair and maintenance expenses. (Sec. 302) Provides burial benefits when a veteran dies at an institution at which such veteran was receiving Department-authorized hospital or nursing home care."
