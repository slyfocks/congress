  <summary>1/4/1995--Introduced.
Baseball Fans and Communities Protection Act of 1995 - Provides that if unilateral terms and conditions of employment in restraint of trade or commerce are imposed by any party that has been subject to an agreement between two or more major league baseball clubs and the labor organization representing the players of major league baseball, such unilateral imposition shall be subject to the antitrust laws. Makes such provision inapplicable to a term or condition imposed solely with respect to a professional baseball player who is a party to a uniform player contract that is assigned, at the time such imposition occurs, to a baseball club that is not a major league professional baseball club.</summary>
