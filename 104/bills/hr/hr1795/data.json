    "date": "1995-06-08", 
    "text": "Federal Acquisition Improvement Reform Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and other Federal law, with respect to Federal military and civilian agency procurement, to provide for: (1) a conference on a specific procurement for anyone interested in submitting a bid or proposal in response to the procurement solicitation; (2) a description of the agency's source selection plan in the solicitation; (3) a preliminary assessment of competitive proposals; and (4) special simplified procedures for purchases of commercial items and for property and services in amounts not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. Revises procurement integrity provisions under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, repealing specific prohibitions against bribery (including offers of future employment) and limiting civil and criminal penalties to certain unauthorized exchanges of contractor bid or proposal information (with increased penalties if information is exchanged for anything of value, or if competitive advantage results). Repeals the exemption from procurement integrity requirements of military and civilian personnel whose contracting authority does not exceed $2,500 (the micro-purchase threshold), and whose duties make it unlikely the individual's total procurements in any 12-month period will exceed $20,000. Outlines specified requirements relating to agency value engineering, among other things: (1) applying such engineering to identify and implement opportunities to reduce capital and operation costs and improve and maintain optimum quality of construction, administrative, program, acquisition, and grant projects; and (2) requiring senior managers to establish appropriate procedures and processes for using qualified personnel, the most cost-effective arrangement for agency work, and sound reporting of agency accomplishments, with any reported savings audited periodically by the agency's Inspector General and split for use between the following year's program and deposit into the Treasury to reduce the Federal debt. Requires the OMB Director to review the policies in this paragraph after a certain period after enactment of this Act for a report to the Congress."
