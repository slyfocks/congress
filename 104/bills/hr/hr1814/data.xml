Environmental Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1995 - Authorizes appropriations to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for FY 1996 for the Office of Research and Development for specified environmental research, development, and demonstration activities. Specifies that no funds are authorized to be appropriated for: (1) the Environmental Technology Initiative, the Climate Change Action Plan, or indoor air pollution research; (2) carrying out programs and activities after FY 1996; or (3) carrying out programs and activities in FY 1996 for which sums are not specifically authorized to be appropriated by this Act. Directs the Administrator to assign to the Assistant Administrator for Research and Development the duties of: (1) developing a strategic plan for scientific and technical activities throughout EPA; (2) integrating that strategic plan into ongoing EPA planning activities; and (3) reviewing all EPA research to ensure the research is of high quality and does not duplicate any other research being conducted by EPA. Directs the Assistant Administrator to report annually to the Administrator and specified congressional committees on EPA research that is duplicative or not of sufficiently high quality. Prohibits the use of funds authorized by this Act for lobbying activities. Requires the Administrator to exclude from consideration for awards of financial assistance made by the Office after FY 1995 persons who received funds appropriated for a fiscal year after FY 1995 from any Federal funding source for a project that was not subjected to a competitive, merit-based award process. Makes the exclusion effective for a five-year period after the person receives such funds. Exempts awards to persons who are members of a class specified by law for which assistance is awarded according to a prescribed formula. Requires the Administrator to ensure that any graduate fellowship award to a student selected after the enactment of this Act is used only to support research that would further missions of the Office in fields in which there exists or is projected to exist a shortage in the number of scientists.</summary>
