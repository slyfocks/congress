  <summary>10/12/1995--Introduced.
Steel Industry American Heritage Area Act of 1995 - Establishes a Steel Industry American Heritage Area in Pennsylvania. Designates the Steel Industry Heritage Corporation as the Area's management entity. Requires: (1) the Secretary of the Interior, for purposes of carrying out this Act, to enter into a compact with the Corporation; and (2) the Corporation to develop and submit to the Secretary for approval a management plan for the Area that presents comprehensive recommendations for the Area's conservation, funding, management, and development. Authorizes the Corporation, for purposes of preparing and implementing the management plan, to use Federal funds made available through this Act to: (1) make loans and grants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with, States and political subdivisions, private organizations, or any person; and (2) hire and compensate staff. Prohibits the Corporation from using Federal funds received under this Act to acquire real property or an interest in real property. Allows such entity to use Federal funds from other sources for their permitted purposes. Makes the Corporation eligible to receive funds appropriated through this Act for a 13-year period after the day on which the compact is signed by the Secretary and the Corporation. Allows such period to be extended for up to five additional years under specified conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) upon request of the Corporation, provide technical and financial assistance to the Area to develop and implement the management plan; and (2) spend Federal funds directly on nonfederally owned property to further the purposes of this Act, especially in assisting units of government in appropriate treatment of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Requires the Historic American Building Survey-Historic American Engineering Record to conduct those studies necessary to document the industrial, engineering, building, and architectural history of the region. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
