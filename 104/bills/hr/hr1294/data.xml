Prohibits the Secretary of the Army from taking any action which is inconsistent with a water control policy of the Corps of Engineers in effect on January 1, 1995, if such action would result in: (1) a reduction of ten days or more in the total number of days in a year during which vessels are able to use a navigation channel; or (2) a substantial increase in flood damage to lands adjacent to a navigation channel, unless such action is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act.</summary>
