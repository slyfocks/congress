Discretionary Spending Reduction and Control Act of 1995 - Amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish discretionary spending limits for FY 1996 through 2000. Extends congressional committee allocation and enforcement provisions and the applicability of certain points of order through FY 2000. Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to revise and extend the budgetary amounts through FY 2000 for the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. Revises the general statement of budget enforcement to apply to discretionary spending limits and pay-as-you-go requirements rather than expired maximum deficit amounts. Extends enforcement of discretionary spending limits, pay-as-you- go requirements, and reporting requirements through FY 2000. Provides a special rule on the interrelationship between changes in discretionary spending limits and pay-as-you-go requirements for enforcement purposes. Prohibits certain changes in direct spending and receipts resulting from this Act, the Personal Responsibility Act of 1995, or the Contract with America Tax Relief Act of 1995 from being reflected in pay-as-you-go estimates. Revises the final sequestration report by the Office of Management and Budget for FY 1996.</summary>
