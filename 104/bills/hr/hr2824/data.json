    "text": "Snowbasin Land Exchange Act of 1995 - Requires the Secretary of Agriculture, subject to specified terms and conditions, to transfer certain lands within the Cache National Forest in Utah to the Sun Valley Company in exchange for specified Company lands of approximate equal value to become a part of the Wasatch or Cache National Forests as appropriate. Adjusts the boundaries of such Forests to encompass the lands. Requires such lands to be managed in accordance with the Weeks Act and other applicable laws, rules, and regulations of National Forest System lands. Finds that, based on congressional review, the Phase I facilities identified and described in the Snowbasin Ski Area Master Development Plan dated October 1995 to be located on National Forest System lands, or any modifications thereof mutually agreed to by the Secretary and the Company, are reasonable and necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics. Directs the Secretary to issue all necessary permits and authorizations for construction and operation of such facilities in accordance with specified procedures and provisions of this Act. Requires the Secretary to report to specified congressional committees on whether construction and operation of Phase I facilities have provided for sufficient environmental protection on National Forest lands affected by such facilities."
