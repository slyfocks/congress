  <summary>6/7/1995--Introduced.
Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to reimburse a Department of Veterans Affairs health-care facility for care given to a Medicare-eligible veteran who is treated for a non-service-connected disability in the same amounts and manner as the Secretary reimburses other Medicare providers or Medicare HMOs. Mandates that the Secretary of Veteran Affairs (Secretary) certify to the Secretary of Health and Human Services annually a list of all Department health-care facilities that are to be treated as Medicare providers or Medicare HMOs. Requires that when the Secretary provides care for which the Secretary receives reimbursement under this section, the veteran must pay the Department any applicable deductible or copayment for care that is not covered by the Medicare program.</summary>
