  <summary>10/24/1995--Passed House amended.
Senior Citizens Housing Safety and Economic Relief Act of 1995 - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to permit a public housing agency (PHA) to: (1) prohibit public housing admission to drug or alcohol abusers; and (2) consider, with respect to an elderly person, whether he or she has successfully completed or is participating in a supervised drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. (Sec. 3) Revises provisions permitting PHA designation of housing for occupancy by only elderly families, only disabled families, or elderly and disabled families. Eliminates the provision permitting vacant units to be made available to the general public. Prohibits admission of drug or alcohol abusers, or persons with such histories (with consideration given to rehabilitation). Prohibits eviction of current tenants from designated projects, except in the case of nonelderly drug or alcohol abusers. Requires PHA assistance to relocated tenants. Sets forth designation plan and Department of Housing and Urban Development approval provisions. States that the provisions of this section shall not apply to low-income Indian housing. (Sec. 4) Revises standards for assisted and public housing lease termination and expedited grievance procedures. (Sec. 5) Amends the National Housing Act to extend the Federal Housing Administration home equity conversion mortgage demonstration program through September 30, 2000. Increases to 50,000 the number of program mortgages, and extends eligibility to one-to-four family unit residences with at least one owner-occupied unit.</summary>
