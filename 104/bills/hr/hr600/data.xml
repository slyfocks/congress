  <summary>1/20/1995--Introduced.
Consequences in Sentencing for Young Offenders Act - Revises provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 regarding grants for correctional facilities (under the violent offender incarceration and truth in sentencing incentive grant program). Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to States to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve adult and juvenile correctional facilities. Directs the Attorney General: (1) in making allocations, to give preference to States that provide assurances that they have in effect graduated sanctions for the State's juvenile justice system; and (2) from a portion of any funds made available under such grant program that are not allocated to an eligible State, to make truth in sentencing incentive grants for the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation, or improvement of juvenile facilities to States that provide assurances to the Attorney General that they have graduated sanctions in effect. Authorizes a State, or States organized as a multi-State compact, to opt to use any Federal grant money allocated for adult correctional facilities to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve youth correctional facilities which provide the State with a range of dispositional options and promote reduced recidivism. Sets forth eligibility requirements.</summary>
