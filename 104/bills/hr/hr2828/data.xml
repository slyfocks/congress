  <summary>12/21/1995--Introduced.
Requires that the basic pay of Members of Congress be treated in the same manner as the basic pay of the most adversely affected Federal employees who are not compensated for any period in which: (1) there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution; or (2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached. Requires the same treatment for the President's basic pay. Directs the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives to promulgate any regulations needed to implement this Act in a manner consistent with the U.S. Constitution.</summary>
