  <summary>4/25/1996--Introduced.
Federal Railroad Administration Performance, Personnel, and Enforcement Act of 1996 - Amends Federal transportation law with respect to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Specifies general qualifications for the FRA Administrator. Makes administratively final any decision of the Administrator made in carrying out specified duties or powers and involving notice and hearing. Deems a final agency action any failure by the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator, or by any person acting on behalf of one or the other to comply with a statutory deadline for regulatory action. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report to the Congress on the FRA's rulemaking process. Repeals hours of service requirements, converting them to administrative regulations subject to modification by the Secretary. Authorizes the Secretary to approve pilot projects to demonstrate the possible benefits of implementing alternatives to the strict application of such hours of service requirements and any subsequent regulations, including maximum and minimum off-duty period requirements. Requires the Secretary to report to the Congress on the application of: (1) train control systems to commuter corridors; and (2) advanced train control to the National Rail Freight System. Directs the Secretary to adopt performance-based rail safety standards, and report to the Congress on progress in implementing them.</summary>
