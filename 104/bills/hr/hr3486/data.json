    "text": "Provides for the transfer or disposal of certain Federal properties at Dutch John, Utah. (Sec. 4) Transfers lands designated for Federal retention from the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture to the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of the Interior and removes them from inclusion in the Ashley National Forest and the Flaming Gorge National Recreational Area. Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture jurisdiction over Federal improvements to be used by the Forest Service. (Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary to survey or resurvey all or portions of the Dutch John Community as necessary to accurately describe parcels identified for transfer among agencies, for Federal disposal, or for retention by the United States, and to facilitate future recordation of title. (Sec. 6) Declares that the Dutch John Community Plan will be recognized by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Forest Service as an indication of potential future land use, and that the Bureau and Forest Service will cooperate with Daggett County in assuring that disposal processes are consistent with that plan and this Act. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to: (1) conduct appraisals to determine fair market value of those properties designated for disposal, subject to specified guidelines; (2) dispose of specified properties identified for disposal without regard to law governing patenting; and (3) assure reasonable and prudent maintenance and proper care of property to be disposed until title has passed. (Sec. 10) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to: (1) conduct threatened and endangered species clearances and other environmental reviews, identify sensitive resources, and (if necessary) formulate mitigation strategies; and (2) prior to transfer and disposal of any lands upon which are found cultural resources which may be eligible for recordation in the National Register of Historic Places, prepare a Memorandum of Agreement, for review and approval by the Utah Office of Historical Preservation and the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, setting forth a strategy for clearance or protection of cultural resources on affected lands. (Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to provide training and transitional operating assistance to personnel designated by Daggett County as successors to the Secretary's operators of those infrastructure systems and facilities designated for disposal. Authorizes appropriations."
