    "as": "Introduced", 
    "date": "1995-01-04", 
    "text": "Anti Redlining in Insurance Disclosure Act - Requires certain insurers to maintain and make available to the Secretary of Commerce and the public specified information on their practices and activities with respect to property and casualty insurance sold in urban areas, such as the number of policies sold by census tract, itemized by demographic characteristics. Mandates disclosure to insurance applicants of the reasons for rejection or nonrenewal. Directs the Secretary to issue regulations to ensure that the practices of insurers in terminating agents who handle property or casualty insurance do not result in: (1) an inappropriate effect on the availability or affordability of insurance from such insurers; and (2) unfair discrimination against agents as a result of their or their clients' geographic locations. Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop, or assist in the improvement of, methods of matching addresses and census tracts to facilitate compliance by insurers with this Act; (2) compile for each urban area aggregate data by census tract for all insurers; and (3) produce tables for each such area indicating aggregate insurance underwriting patterns for various categories of census tracts grouped according to location, age of property, income level, and racial characteristics. Requires such data and tables to be made public. Establishes civil penalties for violations of this Act."
