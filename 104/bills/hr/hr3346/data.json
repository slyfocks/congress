Requires that the plan: (1) reflect the Veterans Integrated Service Network and the Resource Planning and Management System developed to account for expected workload and to ensure fairness to facilities that provide cost-efficient health care; and (2) include procedures to identify reasons for variations in operating costs among similar facilities and ways to improve the allocation of resources among facilities so as to promote efficient use of resources and provision of quality health care."
