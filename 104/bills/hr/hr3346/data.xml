  <summary>4/25/1996--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to the Congress and to implement (unless disapproved) a plan for the allocation of Department of Veterans Affairs health care resources among its health care facilities so as to ensure similar access for eligible veterans having similar economic status, eligibility priority, or medical conditions, regardless of their U.S. region of residence. Requires that the plan: (1) reflect the Veterans Integrated Service Network and the Resource Planning and Management System developed to account for expected workload and to ensure fairness to facilities that provide cost-efficient health care; and (2) include procedures to identify reasons for variations in operating costs among similar facilities and ways to improve the allocation of resources among facilities so as to promote efficient use of resources and provision of quality health care.</summary>
