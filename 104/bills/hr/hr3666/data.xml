Title V: Supplemental - Appropriates additional amounts to: (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs, for Veterans Benefit Administration compensation and pensions; and (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for Government National Mortgage Association (GINNIE MAE) guarantees of mortgage-backed securities loan guarantee program account. Title VI: Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996 - Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act of 1996 - Amends the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Public Health Service Act, as both were amended by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, to require a health plan or an employee health benefit plan that provides maternity (including childbirth) benefits to provide coverage for a minimum 48-hour (for normal vaginal delivery) and 96-hour (for caesarian section) in-patient length of stay (with specified exceptions) for a mother and her newborn following delivery. Mandates timely post-delivery care when the mother and newborn are discharged before expiration of these minimum lengths of stay. Prohibits plans from using certain types of penalties or inducements regarding participants, beneficiaries, policyholders, or providers to circumvent this Act. Provides for enforcement. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) establish an advisory panel; and (2) conduct studies, for reports to certain congressional committees, on specified aspects of maternal and child health care. Title VII: Parity in the Application of Certain Limits to Mental Health Benefits - Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 - Amends ERISA and the Public Health Service Act to require group health plans, if they choose to offer mental health benefits, to provide the same financial conditions for such mental health benefits that they provide for medical and surgical benefits, including the same aggregate lifetime limits and the same annual limits, if any. Makes such parity requirements inapplicable to: (1) substance abuse or chemical dependency treatment; (2) employers of fewer than 50 employees; or (3) any group health plan (or for health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) if this title results in an increase in cost of at least one percent.</summary>
