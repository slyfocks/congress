Specifies that no such presumption shall arise: (1) unless the defendant has maintained a compilation of the information reviewed in the course of the Audit; and (2) if the Audit discloses the presence or likely presence of a release or threatened release of hazardous substances on the property to be acquired, unless the defendant has taken reasonable steps to confirm the absence of such release or threatened release."
