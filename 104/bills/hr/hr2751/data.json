(Sec. 104) Authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to make incentive payments available to individuals serving in the judicial branch. (Sec. 105) Exempts certain boards, commissions, councils, committees, or similar groups established to carry out certain activities under this Act from a specified proscription against interagency financing of groups which do not have a prior and specific statutory approval to receive financial support from more than one agency or instrumentality. Title II: Voluntary Separation Incentives - Sets forth parameters for Federal employee incentive payments which differ on the basis of one's eligibility for immediate retirement. Requires repayment of such incentive payments by retirees upon any subsequent Federal employment, unless repayment is waived by the appropriate authority. Amends the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 to provide for employee backfill prevention. Title III: Reemployment Assistance Programs - Amends Federal civil service law to direct the Office of Management and Budget to establish a Government-wide priority placement program, and each agency to establish an agency-wide priority placement program for employees separated or scheduled to be separated from Federal employment by a reduction in force. (Sec. 302) Authorizes the head of an agency to: (1) pay retraining and relocation incentives according to prescribed guidelines in order to facilitate the reemployment by non-Federal employers of eligible employees who are separated from the agency; and (2) establish a job placement and counseling services program for current and former employees and their families. Title IV: Extension of Benefits - Amends Federal civil service law to provide for continuation of life and health insurance benefits for Federal employees separated from Federal employment under this Act."
