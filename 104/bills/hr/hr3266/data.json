(Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) under, respectively, parts A and F of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a program of block grants to the States for temporary assistance for needy families already with or expecting children (TEA program). Gives such program the stated purpose of increasing the flexibility of States in operating approved statewide programs, with: (1) certain mandatory work and education requirements (as well as penalties against adult family members on TEA who refuse to engage in various specified work activities); and (2) adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents to enable such families to leave the program and become self-sufficient. Includes participation in community service programs and subsidized public sector employment as TEA program work activities. Requires TEA programs to provide certain time-limited cash assistance (and thereafter vouchers) to eligible families entering into an individual responsibility plan with the State (with certain exceptions involving minor children and hardship situations), outlining their obligations in receiving TEA assistance (such as immunizing their children or finishing high school), as well as the specific services the State will provide (such as job preparation and family planning services and, at the State's option, substance abuse treatment services) to enable them to move into private sector employment. Requires State TEA programs also to: (1) establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, over a specified ten-year period; and (2) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. Denies TEA for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators and minor children absent from the home for a significant period. Suspends it for ten years for persons who have fraudulently misrepresented residence to obtain assistance in two or more States. Denies additional cash assistance, as a general rule, for additional children born to families already on TEA (except in cases of rape and incest), unless State law specifically exempts the State TEA program from such denial. Reduces or denies TEA for noncooperation in child support. Outlines State TEA plan contents. Provides for the State's choice of treatment of aliens and families moving interstate, and for the exchange of certain plan information about TEA applicants or recipients with law enforcement officers under prescribed conditions. Sets forth requirements for State plan approval by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), which include certifications that the State will operate a child protection and child support enforcement program under SSA title IV parts B and D (Child-Welfare Services Program and Child Support and Establishment of Paternity Program), respectively. Details TEA program grant administrative provisions: (1) determining the amounts of State grants for family assistance for FY 1996 through 2001; (2) outlining grant uses, including assistance to families in meeting home heating and cooling costs, and a State program under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990; (3) rewarding States with additional grant amounts for reductions in illegitimate births, as well as for population increases and TEA program work activities; and (4) establishing in the Treasury (and providing deposits for) a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs for payments to certain eligible participating States. Makes necessary appropriations. Sets up a Federal loan program for certain State TEA programs for anti-fraud and other specified activities. Makes necessary appropriations. Establishes penalties for States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments. Allows States to terminate assistance payments, but prohibits assistance reduction or termination based on a refusal of an adult to work if the adult is a single custodial parent caring for a child under age six and unable to obtain needed child care for one or more specified reasons. Provides for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State plans or imposition of penalties. Outlines specific program data collection and reporting requirements, as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements. Makes necessary appropriations. Provides for TEA grants to Indian tribes (with a special rule for Alaska Native tribes). Makes necessary appropriations. Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation to obtain information enabling interested persons to evaluate the impact of this title on a random national sample of State TEA recipients and other appropriate low-income families. Makes necessary appropriations. Provides for the treatment of current and previously granted State AFDC (welfare reform) waiver projects. Retains the HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support as the official responsible for administering SSA title IV part A and D programs. Expresses the sense of the Congress encouraging each State operating a TEA program to: (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to engage in work activities; and (2) require non-custodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. (Sec. 104) Allows States to contract with charitable, religious, or private organizations to provide services and administer programs established or modified by this Act, or to provide program beneficiaries with certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement redeemable with such organizations. Prohibits the expenditure of financial assistance under such programs for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expand the data collection efforts of the Bureau of the Census to enable it to collect certain data on grandparent caregivers. (Sec. 106) Directs the HHS Secretary to report to the Congress on the status of State automated data processing systems used in administering State programs under SSA title IV part A. (Sec. 107) Requires the HHS Secretary to report to the Congress on outcomes measures for evaluating the success of the States in moving individuals out of the welfare system through employment as an alternative to the minimum participation rates under mandatory TEA work requirements. (Sec. 108) Makes conforming amendments to SSA, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and related provisions of other specified Federal laws. (Sec. 111) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner) to develop a prototype of a counterfeit-resistant social security card and study and report to the Congress on different methods of improving the social security card application process. (Sec. 112) Requires any organization accepting Federal funds under this Act to disclose that fact in any communication it makes that intends to promote public support or opposition to any Federal, State, or local government policy through any broadcasting station, periodical, or other specified type of general public advertising. Makes any organization failing to make such a disclosure ineligible to receive Federal funds under this Act. (Sec. 113) Amends the Family Support Act of 1988 to remove the \"demonstration\" status of the Job Opportunities for Certain Low-Income Individuals (JOLI) program and give it an increased annual authorization for any fiscal year. Title II: Supplemental Security Income - Subtitle A: Eligibility Restrictions - Amends SSA title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) to: (1) deny SSI by reason of disability to drug addicts and alcoholics for whom addiction or alcoholism would be a contributing factor material to the disability determination; (2) revise representative payee and treatment requirements; (3) deny SSI benefits for ten years to individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more States; (4) deny SSI benefits for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators; and (5) outline the process for periodic review with respect to the continuing eligibility of an individual 18 years of age or older to receive certain SSI disability benefits. Provides certain supplemental funding for alcohol and substance abuse treatment programs. Subtitle B: Benefits for Disabled Children - Revises the rules with respect to childhood eligibility, with corresponding changes to childhood SSI regulations modifying the medical criteria for evaluation of mental and emotional disorders, and discontinuing the use of individualized functional assessments for children. Requires the Commissioner to redetermine the eligibility of any individual under age 18 receiving SSI benefits based on a disability as of the enactment of this Act, and whose eligibility for such benefits may terminate by reason of this Act. (Sec. 212) Provides that at least once every three years the Commissioner shall review the continued SSI eligibility of each individual who has not attained age 18 and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment (or combination of impairments) which may improve (or, which is unlikely to improve, at the option of the Commissioner). Requires a parent or guardian of a recipient whose case is so reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is and has been receiving treatment of the condition which was the basis for the SSI benefits. Provides that if an individual is eligible for SSI disability benefits for the month preceding the month in which the individual attains age 18, the Commissioner shall redetermine such eligibility: (1) during the one year period beginning on the individual's 18th birthday; and (2) by applying the criteria used in determining the initial eligibility for applicants who have attained age 18. Outlines specific requirements governing: (1) continuing disability reviews for low birth weight babies; and (2) benefit payments through representative payees to eligible individuals and their spouses. (Sec. 214) Provides for a reduction in cash SSI benefits payable to institutionalized individuals whose medical costs are covered by private insurance. (Sec. 215) Reduces by specified basic needs and earned income disregard allocations the amount of parental income attributed to disabled children. Subtitle C: State Supplementation Programs - Repeals maintenance of effort requirements applicable to optional State programs for supplementation of SSI benefits. Subtitle D: Studies Regarding Supplemental Security Income Program - Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to report annually to the President and the Congress regarding the SSI program and to make arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences, or other independent entity, to study the disability determination process under SSA titles II and XVI for similar reports. (Sec. 233) Directs the Comptroller General to study and report on the: (1) impact of this title on the SSI program; and (2) extra expenses incurred by families of children receiving SSI benefits that are not covered by other Federal, State, or local programs. Subtitle E: National Commission on the Future of Disability - Establishes the National Commission on the Future of Disability to develop and report to the President and the Congress: (1) a comprehensive study of all matters related to the nature, purpose, and adequacy of all Federal programs serving individuals with disabilities, including the programs under SSA titles II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) and XVI; and (2) recommendations for appropriate action. Authorizes appropriations. Title III: Child Support - Subtitle A: Eligibility for Services; Distribution of Payments - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of SSA title IV to require State plans for child and spousal support to provide: (1) certain services relating to paternity establishment or enforcement of child support obligations; and (2) continuation of services for families ceasing to receive assistance under Aid to Families with Dependent Children. (Sec. 302) Revises payment distribution guidelines for support obligations collected by the State on behalf of a family. (Sec. 303) Requires State plans to establish procedural guidelines for: (1) privacy safeguards regarding paternity and child support actions; and (2) notification of State plan services applicants or recipients about all proceedings and orders affecting child support obligations. Subtitle B: Locate and Case Tracking - Mandates that single statewide automated data systems include a State case registry containing records of: (1) each case in which services are provided by the State agency; and (2) each support order established on or after a specified date. Permits the linking of local registries. (Sec. 312) Requires State plans to include a centralized, automated unit for the collection and disbursement of support payments. Permits the unit to be established by linking local disbursement units through an automated information network if the Secretary agrees that it will not cost more or take more time to establish or operate than a centralized system. (Sec. 313) Requires State plans to: (1) provide for a State-operated and automated State Directory of New Hires containing prescribed information furnished by employers on new personnel; and (2) transmit such information to the National Directory of New Hires. (Sec. 314) Requires States to have statutorily prescribed procedures: (1) for mandatory income withholding for support payments subject to enforcement; and (2) under which wages of a person with a support obligation imposed by a child support order issued before October 1, 1996, shall become subject to withholding if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing. Revises the procedural guidelines for income withholding for child support enforcement. (Sec. 315) Requires the States to have statutorily prescribed procedures to ensure that Federal and State agencies conducting income-withholding activities have access to State locator systems for motor vehicle or law enforcement purposes. (Sec. 316) Revises the Federal Parent Locator Service to provide for additional information which may be transmitted to locate individuals and assets for purposes of: (1) establishing parentage; (2) establishing, setting the amount of, modifying, or enforcing child support obligations; and (3) enforcing child custody or visitation orders. Directs the HHS Secretary to establish in the Federal Parent Locator Service an automated Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders and an automated National Directory of New Hires. (Sec. 317) Requires States to have statutorily prescribed procedures requiring recordation on such documents of the Social Security number of: (1) specified driver's, marriage, and occupational, and professional license applicants; (2) individuals subject to certain domestic relations orders; and (3) deceased individuals (on death records). Subtitle C: Streamlining and Uniformity of Procedures - Requires each State to have the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act in effect as of January 1, 1998. Amends the Federal judicial code to revise the procedures for the court to apply when determining which State order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and enforcement for child support orders.

(Sec. 333) Requires State plans for child and spousal support to provide that the State agency administering the plan will make a determination as to whether a program recipient is cooperating in good faith with State efforts to establish paternity and secure support. Subtitle E: Program Administration and Funding - Directs the Secretary to develop a new incentive system to replace the current one. Revises the guidelines for Federal performance-based incentive payments to the States for effective child support enforcement programs.
