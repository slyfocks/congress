    "text": "Federal Aviation Administration Revitalization Act of 1995 - Establishes the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as an independent Federal agency to succeed the FAA which is currently part of the Department of Transportation (DOT). (Sec. 3) Establishes a Federal Aviation Board (Board) which shall consist of three voting members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and two non-voting members consisting of the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Defense or their designees. Directs the Board to appoint a Chief Executive Officer and to develop, and submit to the Congress, a personnel management system for the Administration. Establishes: (1) the Federal Aviation Management Advisory Committee to provide advice and counsel to the Administration; and (2) an Aircraft Noise Ombudsman to deal with issues regarding aircraft noise. Prohibits the FAA, without the prior approval of the Board, from issuing a proposed or final regulation, airworthiness directive, or advisory circular that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, or by the private sector, of $10 million or more in any one year. Provides an exception in cases of an emergency. Requires Department of Transportation (DOT) review of all proposed or final FAA regulations. Requires an automatic termination date for any regulation which is likely to result in an expenditure of $25 million or more. Directs the Board to develop, and submit to the Congress, an acquisition management system for the FAA. Permits the judicial review of Administration actions. (Sec. 4) Revises Federal transportation law to require the Chief Executive Officer to prepare, subject to Board approval, an annual budget for the FAA. (Sec. 5) Requires the FAA to publish cost-benefit analyses of minimum aircraft safety regulations that result in annualized compliance costs in excess of $25 million. (Sec. 6) Amends the Inspector General Act of 1978 to apply the provisions of such Act to the FAA. (Sec. 7) Directs the Administrator of the current FAA to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking or a denial of the petition in Docket 27791 of the FAA relating to increasing the fee that airlines retain in collecting passenger facility charges. Makes such fee increase sought in such petition effective if the Administrator fails to respond to the petition. (Sec. 8) Requires the Board to establish a select panel to review and report to the Congress on innovative financing mechanisms for ensuring adequate funding for existing and future aviation infrastructure needs. (Sec. 12) Terminates the FAA of the DOT. (Sec. 13) Directs the Secretary of Transportation to terminate 200 employee positions in the Office of the Secretary to reflect reductions in the aviation responsibilities in such office. (Sec. 14) Amends Federal transportation law to make conforming amendments to reflect FAA changes."
