Residential Windstorm Insurance Plan Act of 1996 - Instructs the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to study the advisability and feasibility of establishing a Residential Windstorm Insurance Program designed to provide windstorm insurance to residential property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private market. Delineates Program contents and considerations. Requires the Director to: (1) submit to specified congressional committees study conclusions and estimated Program costs; and (2) enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a feasibility study regarding the establishment of a Federal earthquake insurance program modeled after the "Write Your Own" Program under the National Flood Insurance Program. Directs the Comptroller General, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce to report to the Congress the results of a joint study evaluating the public policy issues associated with conferring favorable Federal tax treatment to multiyear insurance reserves set aside by private insurers for future catastrophic natural disasters.</summary>
