  <summary>12/6/1995--Passed Senate amended.
Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 - Amends the Fair Housing Act with regard to the definition of housing for older persons by: (1) deleting the "significant facilities and services" requirement; and (2) requiring at least 80 percent of occupied units to be occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older. (Thus modifying the exemption from certain familial status discrimination prohibitions.) Makes a good faith attempt at compliance a defense against civil money damages.</summary>
