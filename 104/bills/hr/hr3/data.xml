TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Effective Death Penalty Subtitle A: Habeas Corpus Reform Subtitle B: Federal Death Penalty Procedures Reform Title II: Deterring Gun Crimes Title III: Mandatory Victim Restitution Title IV: Law Enforcement Block Grants Title V: Truth in Sentencing Grants Title VI: Exclusionary Rule Reform Title VII: Stopping Abusive Prisoner Lawsuits Title VIII: Further Streamlining Deportation of Criminal Aliens Title IX: Amendments to Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act Taking Back Our Streets Act of 1995 - Title I: Effective Death Penalty - Subtitle A: Habeas Corpus Reform - Chapter 1: Post Conviction Petitions: General Habeas Corpus Reform - Amends the Federal judicial code to establish a one-year statute of limitations for habeas corpus actions brought by State prisoners. (Sec. 102) Vests authority to issue certificates of probable cause for appeal of habeas corpus orders exclusively in the courts of appeals. Prohibits an appeal from being taken to the court of appeals from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court, or from the final order involving a prisoner in Federal custody, unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause. Authorizes the issuance of such certificate only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a Federal right and if the certificate indicates which specific issues satisfy this standard. (Sec. 104) Permits the denial of a habeas corpus petition on the merits notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust State court remedies. (Sec. 105) Imposes a two-year period of limitation for filing for collateral relief by Federal prisoners. Chapter 2: Special Procedures for Collateral Proceedings in Capital Cases - Sets forth special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases, including provisions regarding the appointment, and claims of ineffectiveness, of counsel. Specifies that, if a stay of execution has expired, no Federal court thereafter shall have the authority to enter a stay or grant relief in a capital case unless: (1) the basis for the stay and request for relief is a claim not previously presented in the State or Federal courts; (2) the failure to raise the claim is the result of State action in violation of the Constitution or U.S. law or the result of Supreme Court recognition of a new Federal right that is retroactively applicable or is based on a factual predicate that could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence in time to present the claim for State or Federal post-conviction review; and (3) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error no reasonable fact finder would have found the petitioner guilty of the underlying offense or eligible for the death penalty under State law. Denies any Federal district court or appellate judge the authority to enter a stay, issue injunctive relief, or grant any equitable or other relief in a capital case on any successive habeas petition unless the court first determines that the petition or other action does not constitute an abuse of the writ. Permits such determination to be made only by the district judge or appellate panel that adjudicated the merits of the original habeas petition, with an exception. Allows a stay to issue under this provision in the Federal courts of appeal only when a majority of the original panel or of the active judges determines the petition does not constitute an abuse of the writ. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) filing of habeas corpus petitions; (2) State unitary review procedures; and (3) limitation periods for determining petitions. Specifies that the adjudication of any petition for habeas corpus with respect to State prisoners and of any motion for habeas corpus regarding Federal prisoners by a person under sentence of death shall be given priority by the district court and by the court of appeals over all non-capital matters. Chapter 3: Funding for Litigation of Federal Habeas Corpus Petitions in Capital Cases - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to require the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) to provide grants to the States to support litigation pertaining to Federal habeas corpus petitions in capital cases. Subtitle B: Federal Death Penalty Procedures Reform - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to provide that the jury (or if there is no jury, the court), in determining whether a sentence of death is justified, shall: (1) consider whether the aggravating factor or factors found to exist outweigh any mitigating factors; and (2) recommend a death sentence if it unanimously finds at least one aggravating factor and no mitigating factor or if it finds one or more aggravating factors which outweigh any mitigating factors. Directs that the jury be instructed that: (1) it must avoid any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors in its decision and should make such a recommendation as the information warrants; and (2) its recommendation is to be based on the aggravating factors and any mitigating factors which have been found, but that the final decision concerning the balance of aggravating and mitigating factors is a matter for the jury's judgment. Title II: Deterring Gun Crimes - Amends the Federal criminal code to set mandatory prison terms for carrying, using, or discharging a firearm or destructive device during a State crime that is a serious violent felony or a serious drug offense, except for the conduct of a person in defense of person or property during the course of a crime committed by another unless the person engaged or participated in criminal conduct that gave rise to the criminal conduct of such other individual. Sets forth mandatory penalties for carrying, using, or discharging: (1) a firearm, a short-barreled rifle or shotgun, a semiautomatic assault weapon, or a machine gun or destructive device or firearm equipped with a silencer in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime for which the person may be prosecuted in Federal court; and (2) a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime for which the person may be prosecuted in Federal court or a serious violent felony or serious drug offense for which the person may be prosecuted in State court, with respect to a person who has been previously convicted of certain firearms offenses. Prohibits the court from imposing a probationary sentence on any person convicted of a violation of this title or from making a term of imprisonment imposed under this title run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment including that imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used. Title III: Mandatory Victim Restitution - Amends the Federal criminal code to require (current law authorizes) the court to order restitution of the victim when sentencing a defendant convicted of specified offenses, including offenses under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. Permits the court to order restitution of any person harmed physically, emotionally, or pecuniarily by unlawful conduct of the defendant during the criminal episode during which the offense occurred, or in the course of a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of unlawful activity related to the offense. Directs the court to: (1) order restitution to a victim in the full amount of the victim's losses without consideration of the economic circumstances of the offender or the fact that a victim has received or is entitled to receive compensation with respect to a loss from insurance or any other source; and (2) specify in the restitution order, upon determination of the amount owed to each victim, the manner in which and the schedule according to which the restitution is to be paid. Specifies that a restitution order: (1) shall constitute a lien against all property of the offender and may be recorded in any Federal or State office for the recording of liens against real or personal property; and (2) may be enforced by the United States and by a victim named in the order in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. Title IV: Law Enforcement Block Grants - Repeals the Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 (title I of the VCCLEA), replacing it with a law enforcement block grant program.
