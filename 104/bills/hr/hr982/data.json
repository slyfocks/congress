Title II: Make Work Pay - Amends SSA titles XIX (Medicaid) and IV part A (AFDC), as well as the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and other specified Federal law, to make various specified changes with regard to certain program aspects, among them: (1) extended Medicaid enrollment for former AFDC recipients; (2) increased AFDC earned income disregards; (3) limited AFDC income and resource disregards of savings for education, first time home purchase, or microenterprise initiatives; (4) child care, including replacement of current Federal child care programs with State-administered block grant programs for child care services, as well as child care for work first program participants; and (5) refundable tax credits for dependent care and other expenses connected with gaining employment in order to enable AFDC recipients to become self-sufficient. Title III: The Work First Program - Amends SSA title IV to replace the current Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F with a new Work First Program that allows participating States to establish one of two types of work programs, with one type similar to the programs operated by Riverside County, California, and the State of Oregon. (Sec. 301) Adds a new part G under which States establishing a work first program have the option to establish community service programs with requirements for securing unsubsidized full-time employment in the private sector. Requires a work supplementation component under such programs that provides for subsidized private sector or State or local government jobs. Requires States to provide program participants with the necessary case management services to ensure integrated benefits and services provided under such programs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) States should target individuals who have not attained 25 years of age for participation in work first programs; and (2) the Secretary and the States should consider the needs of rural areas in designing State plans under SSA title IV parts F and G.

(Sec. 401) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) certain actions pursuant to a child support order, such as denial of visitation rights, should be treated as irrelevant in actions brought to enforce other provisions of the order; (2) the Secretary should investigate accessing Federal data banks not linked to FPLS which are more than marginally useful in handling locate requests; (3) the national network for handling such requests should be used to access State records only through the appropriate State agency; (4) social services should be provided in hospitals to women whose pregnancy results from rape or incest; and (5) States should develop programs like the State of Wisconsin's program for noncustodial parents unable to meet support obligations. (Sec. 421) Establishes the National Child Support Guidelines Commission to study, develop, and report to the President and the Congress a national child support guideline, if one proves advisable.

Title V: Teen Pregnancy and Family Stability - Amends SSA title IV part A with respect to Federal and State roles in reducing teenage pregnancy and promoting family stability, among other things by: (1) giving States the option to deny AFDC for additional children (except those born as a result of rape or incest) of AFDC families while preserving their eligibility for Medicaid; and (2) providing for unmarried minors who are pregnant or who have children to live under adult supervision in order to receive AFDC. (Sec. 503) Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a task force to reduce teenage pregnancy. (Sec. 508) Places restrictions on Federal housing benefits to minors who bear children out-of-wedlock. (Sec. 509) Give States the option of denying AFDC to minor parents. (Sec. 511) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) children should be educated about the risks of early parenthood; (2) reproductive family planning and education should be made available to potential parents; and (3) States should use SSA title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) funds to provide comprehensive services to high-risk youth and work with schools for early identification and referral of such children.

(Sec. 731) Amends the National School Lunch Act to: (1) modify family and group day care home reimbursement provisions under the child and adult care food program; and (2) provide grants to States for making grants to family and day care homes. (Sec. 741) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to make specified downward adjustments in discretionary spending limits under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for FY 1996 through 1998.
