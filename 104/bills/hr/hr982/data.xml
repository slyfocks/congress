TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Time-Limited Transitional Assistance Title II: Make Work Pay Title III: The Work First Program Title IV: Family Responsibility and Improved Child Support Enforcement Title V: Teen Pregnancy and Family Stability Title VI: Program Simplification Title VII: Financing Title VIII: SSI Reform Title IX: Effective Date Individual Responsibility Act of 1995 - Title I: Time-Limited Transitional Assistance - Amends part A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to: (1) require States opting to have work first programs to make ineligible for AFDC any family with a member who has participated in such work program, generally, for two years (and so is prohibited from further participation), while preserving the eligibility of such families for Medicaid; (2) condition eligibility for AFDC on participation in job search activities except during unsubsidized full-time private sector employment; and (3) direct the Secretary of Health and Human Service (Secretary) to establish a database of work first and community service programs participants for use by States opting to have work first programs. Title II: Make Work Pay - Amends SSA titles XIX (Medicaid) and IV part A (AFDC), as well as the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and other specified Federal law, to make various specified changes with regard to certain program aspects, among them: (1) extended Medicaid enrollment for former AFDC recipients; (2) increased AFDC earned income disregards; (3) limited AFDC income and resource disregards of savings for education, first time home purchase, or microenterprise initiatives; (4) child care, including replacement of current Federal child care programs with State-administered block grant programs for child care services, as well as child care for work first program participants; and (5) refundable tax credits for dependent care and other expenses connected with gaining employment in order to enable AFDC recipients to become self-sufficient. Title III: The Work First Program - Amends SSA title IV to replace the current Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F with a new Work First Program that allows participating States to establish one of two types of work programs, with one type similar to the programs operated by Riverside County, California, and the State of Oregon. (Sec. 301) Adds a new part G under which States establishing a work first program have the option to establish community service programs with requirements for securing unsubsidized full-time employment in the private sector. Requires a work supplementation component under such programs that provides for subsidized private sector or State or local government jobs. Requires States to provide program participants with the necessary case management services to ensure integrated benefits and services provided under such programs. Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) States should target individuals who have not attained 25 years of age for participation in work first programs; and (2) the Secretary and the States should consider the needs of rural areas in designing State plans under SSA title IV parts F and G. Title IV: Family Responsibility And Improved Child Support Enforcement - Amends SSA title IV parts A and D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) with regard to: (1) AFDC recipient cooperation in establishing paternity of out-of-wedlock children; (2) various State and Federal locate services, including the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) (which, along with the databases accessed by it, is expanded to form a national network based on comprehensive statewide child support enforcement systems); (3) private access to locate and child support enforcement services; (4) availability of parenting social services for new fathers; (5) the $50 child support disregard (which is eliminated); (6) Federal matching payments and State performance-based incentives and penalties; and (7) State law on paternity establishment. (Sec. 401) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) certain actions pursuant to a child support order, such as denial of visitation rights, should be treated as irrelevant in actions brought to enforce other provisions of the order; (2) the Secretary should investigate accessing Federal data banks not linked to FPLS which are more than marginally useful in handling locate requests; (3) the national network for handling such requests should be used to access State records only through the appropriate State agency; (4) social services should be provided in hospitals to women whose pregnancy results from rape or incest; and (5) States should develop programs like the State of Wisconsin's program for noncustodial parents unable to meet support obligations. (Sec. 421) Establishes the National Child Support Guidelines Commission to study, develop, and report to the President and the Congress a national child support guideline, if one proves advisable. (Sec. 422) Provides under State laws for expedited administrative and judicial procedures for establishing paternity and for establishing, modifying, and enforcing support obligations. (Sec. 431) Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a system for enabling child support information to be obtained at the workplace via W-4 form reporting by employees. Amends IRC to require employers to: (1) deduct and withhold child support obligations from employee wages; (2) pay withholdings to the appropriate payee; and (3) include withheld obligations on the employee's W-2 form. Makes various other specified changes to SSA title IV part D and other applicable Federal laws involving: (1) State procedures for comparing information in the national registry of child support orders (NR) established under this title with information obtained from W-4 form reporting, and for imposing monetary penalties on employees who fail to report support obligations; (2) development of uniform withholding orders; (3) garnishment of certain Federal benefits and seizure of lottery winnings and other payouts to satisfy support arrearages; (4) State reporting of support obligations to credit bureaus; (5) liability of grandparents for financial support of children of their minor children; (6) distribution of child support payments through State child support enforcement agencies to former assistance recipients; (7) due process rights of the parties to child support cases; (8) use of social security numbers under State law for recording marriage licenses, divorce decrees, birth records, and child support and paternity orders; (9) interstate enforcement of child support orders; (10) State suspension of driver's and other types of licenses for nonpayment of support or failure to appear at child support proceedings; (11) treatment of support obligations under the bankruptcy code; (12) the mechanism for offsetting past-due support against income tax overpayments, with changes in the order of refund distributions; and (13) the treatment of assigned and non-assigned support arrearages. Title V: Teen Pregnancy and Family Stability - Amends SSA title IV part A with respect to Federal and State roles in reducing teenage pregnancy and promoting family stability, among other things by: (1) giving States the option to deny AFDC for additional children (except those born as a result of rape or incest) of AFDC families while preserving their eligibility for Medicaid; and (2) providing for unmarried minors who are pregnant or who have children to live under adult supervision in order to receive AFDC. (Sec. 503) Directs the Secretary of Education to establish a task force to reduce teenage pregnancy. (Sec. 508) Places restrictions on Federal housing benefits to minors who bear children out-of-wedlock. (Sec. 509) Give States the option of denying AFDC to minor parents. (Sec. 511) Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) children should be educated about the risks of early parenthood; (2) reproductive family planning and education should be made available to potential parents; and (3) States should use SSA title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services) funds to provide comprehensive services to high-risk youth and work with schools for early identification and referral of such children. Title VI: Program Simplification - Amends SSA titles IV part A and XI, as well as the Food Stamp Act of 1977, among other things to give States increased flexibility in providing AFDC benefits (including restoring those wrongfully terminated) through, among other means, use of electronic benefit transfers, quicker action on waiver requests, and coordination with food stamp rules. (Sec. 631) Expresses the support of the Congress for certain efforts by the Social Security Administration to reduce fraud and abuse in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program under SSA title XVI. (Sec. 632) Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to study and report to the Congress on the feasibility of issuing a single counterfeit-resistant ID card to replace the current social security card and any health security card issued under health reform legislation. (Sec. 641) Sets forth additional AFDC changes involving: (1) State payment options under the program for dependent children of unemployed parents; (2) State determination of the needs of the dependent child and relative with whom the child is living; (3) "fill- the-gap" budgeting; (4) repeal of the requirement for supplemental payments in States paying less than their needs standards; (5) collection of AFDC overpayments from Federal tax refunds; and (6) disregard of student and nonrecurring lump-sum income. (Sec. 646) Amends SSA title XI to raise the limitations on payments under SSA titles I (Old Age Assistance), X (Aid to the Blind), XIV (Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled), and XVI (Supplemental Security Income)(SSI), and IV parts A and E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance). Title VII: Financing - Amends the SSA, the IRC, and the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to make certain aliens ineligible for AFDC, SSI, Medicaid, and food stamps. (Sec. 711) Sets forth special rules concerning aliens and general public assistance. (Sec. 714) Authorizes grants to States to compensate for resident lawful aliens. Provides for allocation of such financial assistance to each State and the District of Columbia. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 721) Amends SSA title IV part A (AFDC) to revise: (1) the definition of "emergency assistance to needy families with children;" and (2) the limitation on State expenditures for such assistance. (Sec. 731) Amends the National School Lunch Act to: (1) modify family and group day care home reimbursement provisions under the child and adult care food program; and (2) provide grants to States for making grants to family and day care homes. (Sec. 741) Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to make specified downward adjustments in discretionary spending limits under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for FY 1996 through 1998. (Sec. 751) Amends IRC to: (1) provide for the inclusion of certain Federal assistance in gross income, assistance such as AFDC and food stamps; (2) make payments of certain assistance reportable to the Internal Revenue Service; (3) deny the earned income tax credit to individuals not authorized to be employed in the United States; (4) phaseout the earned income credit for individuals having more than $2,500 of taxable interest and dividends; and (5) provide for the treatment of children receiving AFDC benefits under the earned income credit.
