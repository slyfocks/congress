  <summary>3/6/1996--Introduced.
Voting Rights of Former Offenders Act - Declares that the right of a U.S. citizen who is otherwise qualified to vote in any election for Federal office shall not be denied or abridged because he or she has committed a criminal offense unless such citizen is imprisoned in a correctional institution or facility at the time of such election. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the States from establishing requirements for the holding of State or local elective office, nor from enacting any State law which affords the right to vote in any election for Federal office on terms less restrictive than those established by this Act. Subjects individuals who intentionally deny, or attempt to deny, any person any right secured by this Act to a fine and imprisonment of up to one year.</summary>
