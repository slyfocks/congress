  <summary>9/26/1996--House agreed to Senate amendment with amendment.
False Statements Accountability Act of 1996 - Amends the Federal criminal code to specify the applicability to the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of provisions prohibiting anyone from knowingly and willfully making misrepresentations to the Government. Provides that such provisions: (1) shall not apply with respect to statements, representations, writings, or documents submitted to a judge or magistrate by a party or that party's counsel in a judicial proceeding; and (2) shall apply to the legislative branch only with respect to administrative matters or any congressional investigation or review conducted consistent with House or Senate rules. Defines "corruptly," for purposes of the prohibition on obstructing proceedings before a Federal agency or the Congress, to mean acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, concealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information. Amends the Federal judicial code to limit the exemption of a Government officer or employee acting within an official capacity from U.S. district court jurisdiction to enforce a Senate subpoena or order to executive branch officers or employees refusing to comply based on a governmental privilege or objection authorized by the executive branch and not on a personal privilege or objection. Amends the Federal criminal code to authorize a U.S. district court to order an individual to provide information which he or she refuses to provide on the basis of the privilege against self-incrimination in proceedings ancillary to either House of Congress. (Currently, such authority applies only to proceedings before either House.)</summary>
