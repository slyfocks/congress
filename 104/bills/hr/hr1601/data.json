Caps appropriations for any one fiscal year. Makes appropriations contingent upon the Administrator of NASA certifying that Space Station budgetary, schedule, and technical commitments will be met. Requires a report to the Congress if such certification cannot be made. Authorizes the Administrator to purchase the Clear Lake Development Facility, containing the Sonny Carter Training Facility, Texas. Provides for coordination of the Space Shuttle program with the Space Station Program Office. States that a priority goal of building the International Space Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. Requires a related commercialization market study. Expresses the sense of the Congress that the \"cost incentive fee\" single prime contract for the International Space Station and the consolidation of program management and financial accountability into a single Space Station Program Office should be applied throughout the civil space program. Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress an annual Space Station report, including accounting of all payments to Russia."
