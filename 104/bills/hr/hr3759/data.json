Increases the ceilings on the maximum contingent liabilities outstanding at any one time for investment insurance and for the financing of investment guarantees issued by OPIC as well as of direct U.S. investment. Extends OPIC's authority to issue such insurance and guarantees through FY 2001. Revises the congressional purpose of OPIC to include increasing U.S. exports to less developed countries and countries in transition from nonmarket to market economies. Revises the composition of the OPIC Board of Directors. Title II: Trade and Development Agency - Authorizes appropriations for the Trade and Development Agency for FY 1997 and 1998. Title III: Export Promotion Programs Within the International Trade Administration - Amends the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985 to authorize appropriations for the Department of Commerce export promotion programs for FY 1997 and 1998. Title IV: Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee - Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to require the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to develop a Federal trade promotion plan that, among other things, shall: (1) identify the means for providing more coordinated export promotion services to small and medium-sized businesses; and (2) establish a set of priorities to promote U.S. exports to, and free market reforms in, the Middle East that are designed to stimulate job growth both in the United States and the region. Requires the TPCC to: (1) identify areas of overlap and duplication among Federal export promotion activities and report on actions to eliminate such overlap and duplication; and (2) report to the Congress on actions taken to promote better coordination among State, Federal, and private sector export promotion activities. Requires the TPCC, in a specified annual report to the Congress, to describe the activities of TPCC departments and agencies to foster U.S. trade and investment which will facilitate private sector development in the Ukraine."
