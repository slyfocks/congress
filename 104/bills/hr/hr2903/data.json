Allows the Board to exempt weak institutions from such assessment. Mandates exemption from such assessment for certain newly chartered and other specified institutions, but requires such institutions to pay semiannual assessments at certain former rates during calendar years 1996 through 1999. (Sec. 2011) (sic) Authorizes certain institutions facing hardship as a result of the special assessment to elect to pay it in two assessments, plus a third supplemental special assessment, determined according to specified formulae. Prescribes adjustments of the special assessment for Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) member banks and certain savings associations. (Sec. 2012) Amends the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) to revise the assessment authority of the Financing Corporation (FICO), extending FICO assessments to all depository institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) instead of SAIF members only. Repeals specified limits on the amount that may be assessed. (Sec. 2013) Declares that the SAIF and the BIF shall be merged into the Deposit Insurance Fund, which shall have a Special Reserve for any excess of the SAIF reserve ratio over the designated reserve ratio. Makes conforming amendments to FHLBA and FDIA. (Sec. 2015) Prescribes procedural guidelines with respect to the refund of assessed payments in a deposit insurance fund in excess of the designated reserve amount. (Sec. 2016) Amends the FDIA to declare that assessment rates for SAIF members may not be less than assessment rates for BIF members. (Sec. 2017) Prohibits the FDIC Board of Directors from setting semi-annual assessments in excess of the amount needed to maintain or achieve the designated reserve ratio of a deposit insurance fund. (Sec. 2018) Terminates as of December 31, 1995, the authority of the Thrift Depositor Protection Oversight Board to establish positions for and pay compensation and benefits to officers and employees, except for 18 individuals to carry out Board functions through May 1, 1996. Subtitle B: Housing - Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to section 8 low-income housing rental increases (including considerations of operating costs, certificate program participation, and same-family occupancy). (Sec. 2052) Amends the National Housing Act to authorize: (1) insurance benefits to mortgagees for foreclosure avoidance activities; and (2) mortgagor assistance activities (mortgage payments or mortgage assignment to the Secretary of Housing and Human Development). Title II: Communications and Spectrum Allocation Provisions - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to state that certain competitive bidding requirements shall not apply to licenses or construction permits issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC): (1) that, as the result of the FCC carrying out specified obligations, are not mutually exclusive; (2) for public safety radio services, including Government uses that protect the safety of life, health, and property and that are not made commercially available to the public; or (3) for initial licenses or construction permits for new terrestrial broadcast digital television (TV) services assigned by the FCC to existing terrestrial broadcast licensees to replace their current TV licenses, unless specified conditions are met. Prohibits the FCC from assigning initial licenses or construction permits to terrestrial commercial TV broadcast licensees to replace their existing broadcast licenses before November 15, 1996, except as provided pursuant to this Act. Extends through FY 2002 the authority of the FCC to grant such licenses or permits. (Sec. 3001) (sic) Requires the FCC to complete all actions necessary to permit the assignment, by September 30, 2002, by competitive bidding of licenses for the use of bands of frequencies that: (1) individually span not less than 25 megahertz (mhz.), unless a combination of smaller bands can reasonably be expected to product greater receipts; (2) in the aggregate span not less than 100 mhz.; (3) are located below three gigahertz (ghz.); and (4) as of this Act's enactment date have not been designated by FCC regulation for assignment, identified by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to provisions of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (NTIAO), or reserved for Government use pursuant to the Act. Directs the FCC to conduct competitive bidding for not less than one-half of such aggregate spectrum by September 30, 2000. Requires the FCC, in making available bands of frequencies for competitive bidding, to: (1) promote the most efficient use of the spectrum; (2) take into account the cost to incumbent licensees of relocating existing uses to other bands of frequencies or other means of communication and the needs of public safety radio services; (3) comply with the requirements of international agreements concerning spectrum allocations; and (4) take into account the costs to satellite service providers that could result from multiple auctions of like spectrum internationally for global satellite systems. Directs the FCC to notify the Secretary if the FCC: (1) is unable to provide for the effective relocation of incumbent licensees to frequencies available for assignment; and (2) has identified bands of frequencies that are suitable for the relocation of such licensees and that are allocated for Government use but that could be reallocated pursuant to the NTIAO Act. Amends the NTIAO Act to require the Secretary, upon receiving a notice from the FCC pursuant to this Act, to prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a report recommending for reallocation for use other than by Government stations of bands of frequencies that are suitable for the uses identified in the FCC's notice. Authorizes any Federal entity which operates a Government station to accept payment in advance or in-kind reimbursement of costs, or a combination thereof, from any person to defray entirely the expenses of relocating the Federal entity's operations from one or more radio spectrum frequencies to other frequencies. Directs that any such payment be deposited in the account of such Federal entity in the Treasury. Authorizes any person seeking to relocate a Government station that has been assigned a frequency within a band allocated for mixed Federal and non-Federal use to submit a petition for such relocation to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Directs NTIA to limit or terminate the Government station's operating license when certain requirements are met. Specifies that if, within one year after the relocation, the Government station demonstrates to the FCC that the new facilities or spectrum are not comparable to those from which the Government station was relocated, the person seeking such relocation must take reasonable steps to remedy any defects or pay the Federal entity for the costs of returning the Government station to the spectrum from which such station was relocated. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) Federal action to expedite spectrum transfer; (2) identification and reallocation of auctionable frequencies; and (3) allocation and assignment of frequencies identified in the second reallocation report. (Sec. 3002) Prohibits any analog TV license from being renewed for a period that extends beyond the earlier of December 31, 2005, or one year after the FCC finds, based on annual surveys, that at least 95 percent of households in the United States have the capability to receive and display TV signals, other than TV signals transmitted pursuant to an analog TV license. Requires that, following such date, only advanced TV licenses be issued. Requires the Department of Commerce, for each calendar year from 1998 to 2005, to conduct a survey to estimate the percentage of U.S. households that have the capability to receive and display TV signals other than those transmitted pursuant to an analog TV license. Directs that licensees for new services be selected by competitive bidding. Requires the FCC to: (1) ensure that, as analog TV licenses expire, spectrum previously used for the broadcast of analog TV is reclaimed and organized in such manner as to maximize the deployment of new and existing services; and (2) complete the competitive bidding procedure by March 1, 2002. Requires the FCC to establish procedures to ensure that, within the year prior to the reversion date, the advanced TV licensees provide each requesting household without the capability to receive and display TV signals other than those transmitted pursuant to an analog TV license with the capability to receive and display advanced TV service. Mandates that each advanced TV service licensee provide, each day for the duration of its license, at least one non-subscription TV service that meets or exceeds minimum technical and other standards established by the FCC, as well as any other regulations pursuant to the Act and the Children's TV Act of 1990. Directs the FCC: (1) in setting such minimum technical standards, to ensure that picture and audio quality are at least as good as provided to recipients under current FCC rules for National Television Systems Committee signals and to adopt other requirements to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced TV services; and (2) revoke the license of any advanced TV licensee who fails to meet this condition of the license. Requires the FCC to promulgate regulations to assure the dissemination of converter boxes or devices necessary to ensure access to digital TV to all households that desire such access at a reasonable cost. Title III: Medicaid - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) for the following purposes. (Sec. 201) (sic) Sets a prescribed limit on the total amount of payments in grant awards to a State under Medicaid for FY 1997 through 2002 for each separate group of listed Medicaid beneficiaries in the State based on the total net matchable Medicaid expenditures for the State for the fiscal year, with certain exceptions for States providing medical assistance pursuant to an approved waiver and for certain Medicare cost-sharing, information system, Indian health and other specified expenditures. Declares that such limitation shall not be construed as applying to payments for the purchase and delivery of qualified pediatric vaccines. Details enforcement-related provisions for assuring actual payments to States consistent with such limitation. Provides for application of enhanced matching under State payment provisions for development of certain information reporting systems. Title IV: Medicare Savings - Amends SSA title XVIII (Medicare) part A to outline various specified changes related to the Hospital Insurance program under it that are designed to achieve Medicare savings through such measures involving, among other things: (1) adjustments for estimated case mix increase when recalibrating diagnosis-related group (DRG) prospective payment system (PPS) rates for inpatient hospital services; (2) temporary additional reduction in PPS capital and hospital-specific rates; (3) reductions in adjustments for disproportionate share hospitals (DSH) and indirect medical education (IME); (4) elimination of DSH and IME payments attributable to outlier payments; (5) reductions to capital payments for PPS-exempt hospitals; (6) basing updates to per diem cost limits effective for FY 1996 for skilled nursing facilities on limits for FY 1993, with payment for such facilities made on an interim prospective basis until FY 1999 when a full PPS is to be implemented; (7) salary equivalency guidelines for various specified therapy services; (8) removal of graduate medical education (GME), IME, and DSH payments from the calculation of the adjusted average per capita cost; (9) additional payments to hospitals for managed care enrollees; (10) rebasing the target amount and eliminating the volume adjustment for sole community hospitals; (11) expanding the essential access community hospitals (EACH) program (renamed the rural primary care hospital program) to all States with an end to new EACH designations, a limitation on length of inpatient stays, and certain payment-related changes; and (12) changes in the treatment of certain transfer cases.

(Sec. 11128) Waives cost-sharing for mammography. (Sec. 11131) Establishes set payment amounts for certain vaccines and ties annual increases in them to increases in the yearly update for physicians' services for the particular year involved. Eliminates coinsurance and deductible for hepatitis B vaccine. (Sec. 11141) Directs the HHS Secretary to use a competitive process to contract with centers of excellence for cataract surgery, coronary artery by-pass surgery, and such other services as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, with payment for such services to be made on the basis of specified negotiated or all-inclusive rates. Requires the amount of payment made by the HHS Secretary to the center for covered services to be less than the aggregate amount of payments that would have otherwise been made to it had not such process been in effect. Requires that a portion of such savings be rebated to each individual to whom such services are furnished. (Sec. 11142) Restructures payment policy for home health services, among other things: (1) temporarily basing updates to per visit cost limits on pre-July 1, 1994 levels; (2) providing interim reduced cost limits for FY 1997 through 1999; (3) directing the HHS Secretary, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after FY 2000, to provide for payments for the services in accordance with a PPS which pays home health agencies on a per episode basis; (4) basing payment on the location where they are furnished; and (5) establishing a post-hospital home health benefit under Medicare part A while transferring other home health services to Medicare part B. (Sec. 11148) Provides for permanent extension of certain secondary payer provisions under Medicare, including those for the working disabled. (Sec. 11161) Modifies Medicare part B premium provisions, directing the HHS Secretary, during each September, to determine and promulgate a monthly premium rate for the succeeding calendar year equal to 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for that succeeding calendar year.

Extends to such individuals a broader choice of managed care coverage through qualified HMOs, CMPs, preferred provider organizations, or provider sponsored organizations (PSOs). Delineates the types of benefits offered by each managed care organization or plan, requiring certain minimum services, with supplemental benefits subject to the Secretary's approval and provided at the enrollees' option.

(Sec. 11206) Allows the HHS Secretary to waive certain HMO- and CMP-related requirements under Medicare with regard to certain described experiments and demonstration projects under provisions for economy while maintaining or improving quality in health services (competitive pricing demonstrations). Requires the HHS Secretary to report to the Congress specific recommendations for a new payment methodology for eligible organizations, with contracts under Medicare part C to be based on the results of such demonstrations. (Sec. 11207) Eliminates the health care prepayment plan option for entities eligible to participate under Medicare part C. (Sec. 11208) Provides various specified changes under the Medicare supplemental policy (Medigap) program, including uniform enrollment periods and community-rated premiums. (Sec. 11209) Directs the HHS Secretary to develop a standard package of benefits (in addition to those already covered under Medicare) that may be offered by eligible organizations under Medicare part C. Requires the HHS Secretary to request the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to examine the standard benefit packages for Medigap policies and recommend any restructuring needed in order to facilitate to the maximum extent feasible comparison across such policies and benefits offered by eligible organizations. Requires the HHS Secretary, after taking into account any such recommendations, to restructure such packages as needed. Provides during FY 1996 through 2000 for Medicaid payments to certain States with large populations of illegal immigrants to pay health care providers for services to such populations.

Gives States the option of purchasing health insurance, or paying the costs of health insurance, for enrollees in providing medical assistance under the Medicaid program. (Sec. 11333) Modifies provisions for an extension of eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid that concern the State \"wrap-around\" option, in which a State may pay a family's expenses for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar costs for health insurance or other health coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative or by an employer of the absent parent of a dependent child. Provides that, in the case of such coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative, the State may limit the amount of any deductible or copayment for any health care item or service to the applicable portion of the amount the State would pay if such item or service had been furnished by a provider participating in the program under the State Medicaid plan.
