  <summary>02/13/1995--Introduced.
Franked Mail Savings Act - Amends the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1991 to establish an Official Mass Mailing Allowance for Members of the House of Representatives. Requires the Official Mass Mailing Allowance to be: (1) available only for postage for any mass mailing sent by a Member as franked mail; (2) the sole source of funding for any such postage; and (3) available in a session of Congress in an amount that does not exceed the total amount allocated to the Official Mail Allowance of a Member in such session. Treats the Official Mass Mailing Allowance and mass mailings separately from the Official Mail Allowance. Continues the applicability of current provisions of law relating to mass mailings sent by a Member or Member-elect subject to certain conditions. Sets forth requirements for the submission of samples of mass mailings to the House Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards. Revises the formula for determining the Official Mail Allowance (thereby reducing the maximum allocation allowed). Prohibits the transfer of any amount (except for amounts from the Official Mass Mailing Allowance) to or from the Official Mail Allowance of a Member. (Currently, transfers up to a specified amount are allowed from the Official Expenses and Clerk Hire Allowances.)</summary>
