Includes all other items in the operating budget. Amends the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to require the following reports to specified congressional committees on capital activities and operating activities associated with: (1) roadways and bridges, airports and airway facilities, and mass transportation systems; (2) waste water treatment and related facilities; (3) water resource projects; and (4) public buildings."
