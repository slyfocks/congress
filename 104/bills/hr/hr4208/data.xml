TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Cop-Killer Bullets Title II: Domestic Violence Gun Violence Control Act - Title I: Cop-Killer Bullets - Amends the Federal criminal code to expand the definition of "armor piercing ammunition" to include a projectile that may be used in a handgun and that the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be capable of penetrating body armor. Requires the Secretary to determine whether a projectile is capable of penetrating body armor in accordance with regulations providing for uniform testing of such projectiles against Body Armor Exemplar standards for protection of law enforcement officers. Title II: Domestic Violence - Defines "crime involving domestic violence" as a crime of violence committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian (spouse) of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which such crime was committed. Prohibits persons under indictment for, or convicted in any court of, a crime involving domestic violence from: (1) selling or otherwise disposing of any firearm or ammunition to specified classes of individuals, such as drug addicts and illegal aliens; or (2) possessing or shipping or transporting in interstate or foreign commerce any firearm or ammunition; or (3) receiving any firearm or ammunition which has been so shipped or transported. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations providing for effective receipt and secure storage of firearms relinquished by or seized from such persons. Excludes persons convicted of a crime involving domestic violence from administrative relief from certain firearm prohibitions.</summary>
