    "text": "Sexual Harassment Prevention Act of 1996 - Provides that anyone (including a government entity) who, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, engages in sexual harassment, or retaliates against any person for opposing sexual harassment or filing a complaint or otherwise participating in a civil action under this Act, shall be liable to the person injured by that harassment or retaliation for any appropriate relief, which may include money damages. Authorizes the court to award a prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorney's fee and other litigation expenses (including expert witness fees) as part of the costs. Defines \"sexual harassment\" as an unwelcome sexual advance or request for sexual favors, or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, where: (1) submission to such conduct is either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a specified relationship; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct is the basis for decisions or actions regarding the person who submitted to or rejected that conduct; or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the relationship or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment within that relationship. Specifies that such relationship includes a relationship between: (1) a patient and a physician, psychotherapist, or dentist; (2) a client and an attorney, marriage, family, or child counselor, social worker, or accountant; (3) a beneficiary and an executor, trustee, or administrator of a trust or estate; (4) an employee and an employer if the employer has fewer than 15 employees for each working day in each of 33 or more calendar weeks in the current and in the preceding calendar year; or (5) the parties to a contract or persons negotiating a contract or seeking to enforce claimed rights under a contract. Authorizes additional funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for FY 1997 and thereafter."
