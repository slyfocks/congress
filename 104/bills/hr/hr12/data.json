Includes in the gross estate the value of each development right retained by the donor in the conveyance of the easement. Makes such tax due on a date certain after the disposition of such property. Provides that such land subject to the exclusion will have a carryover basis for purposes of determining gain or loss. Excludes from the gift tax transfers by gift of land subject to a qualified conservation easement. Excludes from gross income gain from the sale or exchange of eligible farmland that is subject to a qualified covenant which does not permit any use of such farmland for purposes other than as farmland."
