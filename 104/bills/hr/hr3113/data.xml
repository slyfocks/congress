Partnership for Productive Ports Act - Amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 to: (1) require the Federal share of the cost of creation of confined dredged material disposal facilities to be determined in the same manner as such costs are determined for a harbor navigation project under such Act; (2) define "confined disposal facility" as any alternative to ocean disposal or ocean disposal with capping; and (3) include costs related to confined disposal facilities as operation and maintenance costs under such Act. Directs the Secretary of the Army to create, operate, and maintain a confined dredged material disposal facility in the Port of New York and New Jersey.</summary>
