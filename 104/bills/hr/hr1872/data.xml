Authorizes planning grants to assist an area that is projected to be eligible for a formula grant in the subsequent fiscal year in preparing for its responsibilities under the grant. Title II: Care Grant Program - Changes or adds provisions concerning a program of grants for health care and support services for individuals and families with HIV disease (care grant program) relating to: (1) the uses of the grants; and (2) grants to establish HIV care consortia (including allowing grants to for-profit providers in certain circumstances). (Sec. 204) Conditions care grant program grants on compliance with provisions (enacted by this Act) relating to testing of pregnant women and newborn infants. Requires States receiving care grants to prohibit health insurance discontinuance, and regulate terms changes, based on HIV status or testing. Authorizes grants to eligible States for: (1) counseling and testing pregnant women and testing newborn infants regarding HIV disease; (2) counseling on HIV disease for the parents or guardians of positive infants; and (3) collecting data on how many are tested. Makes States eligible if they require certain testing, counseling, and disclosure regarding pregnant women, newborns, mothers, and guardians. Authorizes appropriations. Mandates a determination whether it has become a routine U.S. health care practice to carry out such testing, counseling, and disclosure and, if so, prohibits care grant program grants unless: (1) the State requires the testing, counseling, and disclosure; or (2) the HIV antibody status of 95 percent of newborns in the State is known. Applies the testing, counseling, and disclosure requirements only to the extent funding is available from specified Federal sources or from State or private sources that elect to provide the funding. (Sec. 205) Changes or adds provisions concerning the care grant program relating to: (1) application requirements; (2) State allocation of assistance; and (3) technical assistance.

Authorizes early intervention services planning grants. Modifies application requirements. Authorizes appropriations for categorical grants. Title IV: General Provisions - Replaces provisions authorizing demonstration grants for research and services for pediatric HIV disease patients and pregnant women with HIV disease with provisions authorizing grants providing women, infants, and children: (1) opportunities to be participants in research of potential clinical benefit regarding HIV disease; and (2) outpatient health care. Authorizes the use of limited funds for training and technical assistance. Authorizes appropriations. Mandates grants for demonstration projects that provide for the care and treatment of individuals with HIV disease that assess treatment model effectiveness, are innovative, and have the potential to be replicated locally or nationally. Requires reserving a specified percentage of the amounts available under title XXVI (HIV Health Care Services Program) of the Public Health Service Act for grants under this paragraph. Removes existing provisions relating to special projects of national significance. Transfers provisions (currently located in title VII (Health Professions Education) of the Public Health Service Act) authorizing grants and contracts to assist in training health care practitioners regarding HIV disease to such title XXVI. Modifies the projects for which the assistance may be used. Authorizes appropriations. Replaces an authorization of appropriations for carrying out provisions on evaluations and reports regarding title XXVI with provisions requiring that those evaluation and reporting provisions be carried out with amounts available under evaluation and reporting provisions of title II (Administration and Miscellaneous Provisions) of the Public Health Service Act. Title V: Additional Provisions - Modifies the formulas for determination of the amount of emergency relief grants and care grants. Authorizes appropriations to carry out the emergency relief grant program and the care grant program. Mandates development of a methodology for adjusting the percentages made available to each of those two programs. Repeals existing provisions authorizing appropriations separately for the two programs. Adds funeral service practitioners to the list of employees included in the definition of "emergency response employee." Amends the Public Health Service Act to remove a requirement that the Secretary of Health and Human Services carry out trauma care responsibilities through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration.
