Amends enforcement guidelines to grant a State regulatory authority sole enforcement responsibility for the Act and relevant State law, subject only to State administrative and judicial review. Confers enforcement responsibility for Federal water quality laws (including State law enacted pursuant thereto) upon the regulatory authority approved by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. Revises judicial review guidelines to: (1) repeal the provision that availability of judicial review of a State regulatory authority does not limit the operation of rights with respect to citizens' suits to compel compliance with Federal law; and (2) declare that an action by the Secretary of the Interior regarding inadequate State enforcement is subject to judicial review by the U.S. district court for the district which includes the capital of the State whose program is at issue. Establishes a three-year statute of limitations for an enforcement proceeding under this Act. Excludes public roads from the regulatory purview of the Act."
