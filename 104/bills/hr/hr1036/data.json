    "text": "Metropolitan Washington Airports Amendments Act of 1995 - Amends the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986 to revise the term \"airport purposes\" with respect to real property of the Metropolitan Washington Airports to limit the inclusion of nonprofit, public use facilities to those which are not inconsistent with the needs of aviation. (Sec. 4) Increases the number of persons on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority: (1) from 11 to 15 members; and (2) whom the President must appoint with the advice and consent of the Senate from one member to five members. Requires board members appointed by the President to be registered voters of States other than Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia. Requires two of the members appointed to the board by the President to serve for a term of four years. Authorizes a member to serve after the expiration of that member's term until a successor has taken office. Requires vacancies on the board to be filled in the manner in which the original appointment was made. Requires any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the expiration of the term for which the member's predecessor was appointed to be appointed only for the remainder of such term. Declares that no more than three members of the board appointed by the President may be of the same political party. Requires presidential appointees on the board to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the national interest in carrying out their duties. Requires nine votes (currently, seven) to approve bond issues and the annual budget. (Sec. 5) Establishes the Federal Advisory Commission of the Airports Authority (thereby effectively replacing the Board of Review of the Airports Authority). (Sec. 6) Requires Airports Authority actions to be submitted to the Federal Advisory Commission (currently, the Board of Review) for review. Requires certain Airports Authority decisions to remain in effect and not be set aside solely by reason of a judicial order invalidating certain functions of the Board of Review. (Sec. 7) Revises requirements for congressional review of Airports Authority actions. (Sec. 8) Provides for the removal of Federal Advisory Commission (previously, Board of Review) members by the Secretary of Transportation (currently, by a two-thirds vote of the board of directors). (Sec. 11) Directs the Airports Authority to continue to enforce certain restrictions contained in the Metropolitan Washington Airports Regulations with respect to the use of the Dulles access highway. (Sec. 13) Prohibits the Secretary from issuing an exemption under specified sections of title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations regarding the allocation of slots at high density airports if such exemption would adversely affect safety."
