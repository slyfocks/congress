(Sec. 4) Revises provisions regarding title to intellectual property arising from Federal-industry cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) to provide: (1) the collaborating partner (partner) with the option to choose an exclusive or nonexclusive license for a prenegotiated field of use for a resulting CRADA invention; (2) confidentiality of commercial information; and (3) limited Government laboratory right to require a partner to grant applicant licenses in exceptional circumstances of public health or safety, Federal requirements, or partner noncompliance. Provides that a partner may retain title to an invention made solely by its employees in exchange for granting the Government a worldwide license to use the invention. (Sec. 5) Provides, with regard to income distribution from intellectual property received by Federal laboratories, for: (1) agency payments of $2,000 plus 15 percent of future royalties to the inventor, and payments to other contributing personnel; and (2) laboratory use of royalties for related research and other expenses. (Sec. 6) Provides that if the Government chooses not to pursue the rights of an invention of a Federal employee or former employee, such individual may obtain the right of ownership or otherwise promote the invention's commercialization. (Sec. 7) Makes a conforming amendment to Federal law (the Bayh- Dole Act). (Sec. 8) Amends the National Institute of Standards Act to: (1) expand the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Visiting Committee from 9 to 15 members (with an increase in industry members); (2) provide for transportation between the Institute and nearby public transportation; and (3) increase the cap on postdoctoral fellowships from 40 to 60. (Sec. 9) Amends the Act to permit Federal loan, lease, or gift of excess scientific equipment to schools and nonprofit institutions. (Sec. 10) Extends indefinitely a specified personnel management demonstration project under the National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987. (Sec. 11) Amends the Fastener Quality Act with respect to heat mill certification, commingling, and minor nonconformance. (Sec. 12) Directs NIST to: (1) coordinate Federal, State, and local technical standards and conformity assessment activities; and (2) report to the Congress regarding implementation within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Directs Federal agencies and departments to use technical standards developed by voluntary consensus bodies, unless impractical or inconsistent with applicable law. (Requires an explanatory report to the Office of Management and Budget.) (Sec. 13) Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award program offers substantial benefits to U.S. industry and that all program appropriations should be spent in support of its goals."
