    "text": "Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to permit the export of Alaskan North Slope oil unless the President finds, within five months after enactment of this Act, that such exportation is not in the national interest. Sets forth mandatory considerations in evaluating whether such exportation is in the national interest, including an environmental review and supply and employment impact analysis. Mandates that, except in certain cases, such oil be transported by U.S.-owned merchant marine vessels. Retains the President's authority to prohibit exportation of the oil. Instructs the Secretary of Commerce to issue, within 30 days after the President's national interest determination, necessary rules, including any licensing requirements and conditions, to implement such determination. Directs the Secretary to recommend that the President take appropriate action (including modification of export authorization) if oil exports under authority of this Act have caused sustained material supply shortages or price increases significantly above world market levels, together with sustained material adverse effects upon domestic employment. Instructs the Comptroller General to review and report to specified congressional committees on energy production in California and Alaska and the effects of Alaskan North Slope crude oil exports upon consumers, independent refiners, and shipbuilding and ship repair yards on the West Coast and in Hawaii."
