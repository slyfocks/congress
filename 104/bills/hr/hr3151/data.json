Outlines project requirements. Requires annual joint reports from the Secretaries to the Congress on the demonstration project. Directs the Comptroller General, at the end of each year in which the project is carried out, to determine and submit to the Congress a report on the extent, if any, to which the costs of the Secretary under the TRICARE Program and the HHS Secretary under the Medicare Program have increased as a result of the project."
