      <text>Mr. Taylor (MS) notified the House of his intention to offer a resolution that raises a question of the privileges of the House relating to the statutory responsibility of enacting a budget into law. The Chair announced that, under the provisions of rule IX, a resolution offered from the floor by a Member other than the Majority Leader or the Minority Leader as a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence only at a time or place designed by the Speaker in the legislative schedule within 2 legislative days of its being properly noticed. The Chair announced that such a designation would be made at a later time, pending a determination as to whether the resolution constituted a question of privilege.</text>

Directs the Secretary, each calendar year from 1998 to 2005, to conduct a survey to estimate the percentage of households in the United States that have the capability to receive and display video signals other than those transmitted pursuant to an analog TV license. Requires the FCC to: (1) ensure that, as analog TV licenses expire, the spectrum previously used for the broadcast of analog TV signals is reclaimed and reallocated so as to maximize the deployment of new services (and directs that licensees for new services be selected by competitive bidding); and (2) complete the competitive bidding procedure by May 1, 2002. Directs the FCC to establish procedures to ensure that, within the year prior to the reversion date, the advanced TV licensees provide each requesting household with the capability to receive and display video signals for advanced TV services. Requires: (1) each advanced TV service licensee to provide, for a minimum of five years from such date, at least one nonsubscription video service that meets or exceeds minimum technical standards established by the FCC; and (2) the FCC, to the extent technically feasible, to ensure that picture and audio quality are at least as good as that provided to recipients within the Grade B contour of an analog TV license and to revoke the license of any advanced TV licensee who fails to meet this condition of the license.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish for each State a per capita medical assistance limit for each such category and for administrative expenditures for a fiscal year according to a certain formula that accounts for inflation. Requires the Secretary to notify each State before the beginning of each fiscal year of the per capita limits established for the State for the fiscal year. Exempts certain State expenditures under Medicaid from being subject to such limits and from being taken into account in establishing them. Provides for certain adjustments to such per capita limits, and outlines enforcement provisions for assuring that payments to the States are consistent with them. Places certain restrictions on the authority of States to apply less restrictive income and resource methodologies for making certain eligibility determinations under Medicaid. Subtitle B: Medicaid Managed Care - Repeals certain barriers to: (1) authorize States to require certain Medicaid-eligible individuals to enroll with an eligible managed care provider of their choice under contract with the State to furnish them with all medically necessary assistance as a condition of receiving Medicaid assistance; and (2) add anti-fraud and sanctions requirements applicable to eligible managed care providers. (Sec. 7105) Provides for assuring adequacy of payments to Medicaid managed care plans and providers.

Subtitle C: Additional Reforms of Medicaid Acute Care Program - Revises provisions governing the use of enrollment fees, premiums, deductions, cost-sharing, and similar charges in order to permit increased flexibility in Medicaid cost-sharing. (Sec. 7202) Requires the Secretary to define, by regulation promulgated after consultation with States and organizations representing health care providers, those treatment services, in addition to those otherwise covered under a State Medicaid plan, that must be covered under Medicaid as measures necessary to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan. (Sec. 7203) Provides that no change in law which has the effect of imposing a requirement on a State under a State plan under Medicaid, and with respect to which the Secretary is required to issue regulations to carry out such requirement, shall take effect until the date the Secretary promulgates such regulation as a final regulation. Provides that any change in a regulation of the Secretary relating to the Medicaid program shall not become effective until the beginning of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the change was promulgated. Gives the States certain options around such requirements. Expresses the sense of the Congress that if a State is required by future legislation to provide for additional services, eligible individuals, or otherwise incur additional costs under its Medicaid program, the Federal Government shall provide for full payment of any such additional costs for at least the first two years in which such requirement applies.

Subtitle F: Fraud Reduction - Directs the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop mechanisms to better monitor and prevent inappropriate payments under Medicaid in the case of individuals who are dually eligible for benefits under such program and the Medicare program under SSA title XVIII.

Title VIII: Medicare - Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 - Amends SSA titles XI and XVIII and the Internal Revenue Code, restructuring the current Medicare program, and creating a new Medicare Choice program within it, while also providing for corresponding tax incentives for Medicare Choice medical savings accounts (MSAs) and other Medicare Choice-related matters. Subtitle A: Medicare Choice Program - Gives individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare part A (Hospital Insurance) and enrolled under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) the opportunity to elect Medicare coverage during annual, coordinated election periods under either the new Medicare Choice benefit package or through the existing fee-for-service system under such parts. Includes in the Medicare Choice benefit package a high ($10,000) deductible-Medisave product under a specified demonstration plus contributions to Medicare Choice MSAs, as well as separate fee-for-service products and products offered under certain provider- and union-sponsored plans by qualified Medicare Choice organizations. Directs the Secretary to provide for a nationally coordinated educational and publicity campaign to inform individuals who are eligible to elect Medicare Choice products about them and the election processes provided under this subtitle. Directs the Secretary to conduct demonstration projects to test alternative approaches to coordinated open enrollments in different markets, including different annual enrollment periods and models of rolling open enrollment periods. (Sec. 8002) Requires qualified Medicare Choice organizations (except those with union sponsors, Taft-Hartley sponsors, or, for a limited time, provider sponsors) to be licensed under State law in each State in which they offer a Medicare Choice product. Requires such organizations to assume full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of health care services (other than hospice care).
