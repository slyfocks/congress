(Sec. 1101) States that one purpose of this Act is to ensure that privatization of the U. S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) does not result in any adverse effects on the pension benefits of employees at facilities that are operated in the performance of functions vested in USEC. Declares that USEC shall abide by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in effect on the privatization date at each individual facility. Permits employees who transfer to USEC from other Federal employment to transfer their accrued retirement benefits to a USEC retirement system, or to retain their coverage under their existing Federal plan. Terminates USEC's status as the exclusive marketing agent for the United States for entering into contracts for providing enriched uranium and uranium enrichment and related services. Declares that the privatization of USEC shall not affect the terms, rights, or obligations of the parties to any power purchase contracts. Sets forth the effects of the transfer of uranium enrichment contracts. Declares that the United States shall remain obligated on those contracts during their term. States that USEC shall establish prices for its products, materials, and services on a profit-making basis. Prescribes guidelines under which the Department of Energy (DOE) shall accept responsibility for the treatment, disposal and storage of low-level radioactive waste and mixed waste. States that, as of the privatization date, all liabilities and any judgment against the Corporation attributable to the operation of the USEC from the transition date to the privatization date shall be direct liabilities of, and judgments against, the United States. Authorizes the Secretary of Energy to transfer raw and enriched uranium to USEC before the privatization date without charge. Prescribes guidelines under which: (1) USEC is authorized to establish a private corporation to implement the privatization of USEC; and (2) USEC privatization may be implemented by means of a transfer of assets and liabilities to such corporation and a merger or consolidation with it. Prohibits the Secretary from allowing the privatization of USEC by means of a public offering unless the Secretary determines that the estimated gross proceeds from the USEC sale will be an adequate amount. Limits to ten percent of the total votes of all outstanding USEC voting securities the number of securities any person may acquire or hold, directly or indirectly, during the three years following any privatization by means of a public offering. Provides that the proceeds to the U.S. Government from privatization shall be included in the budget baseline and be counted as an offset to direct spending. Mandates termination of any USEC license if privatization results in its being owned, controlled or dominated by a foreign entity or otherwise inimical to the security of the United States. Precludes USEC from implementing the privatization plan less than 60 days after the date that the Comptroller General presents an evaluation of the plan to the Congress. Provides for periodic certification of USEC by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission upon privatization. Authorizes the licensing of Corporation facilities using AVLIS technologies for uranium enrichment. (Sec. 1102) Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to repeal the termination date for Nuclear Regulatory Commission authority to assess annual charges (thus making such authority permanent). (Sec. 1103) Amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to repeal the exclusion of cogeneration process from the definition of \"energy savings\". (Sec. 1104) Authorizes the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assess and collect radiological emergency preparedness fees.

Subtitle C: Army Corps of Engineers - Establishes the Army Civil Works Regulatory Program Fund as a repository for certain regulatory fees established by the Secretary of the Army. Subtitle D: Helium Reserve - Helium Act of 1995 - Amends the Helium Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to: (1) enter into agreements with private parties for the recovery and disposal of helium on Federal lands; (2) grant leasehold rights to such helium; (3) store, transport, and sell crude helium; and (4) maintain and operate existing crude helium storage at the Bureau of Mines Cliffside Field. Directs the Secretary to: (1) cease producing, refining, and marketing refined helium; and (2) dispose of all facilities, equipment, and Federal property interests relating to refined helium activities. Requires the Secretary to impose fees for helium storage, withdrawal, or transportation services. Prescribes guidelines for: (1) the purchase of helium by Federal agencies from certain private persons; and (2) the sale of crude helium by the Secretary. Prohibits the Secretary from making crude helium sales in amounts that will disrupt the crude helium market price. Mandates that proceeds from helium sales be paid to the Treasury. Identifies circumstances under which the Secretary must meet a certain deadline for the elimination of helium stockpiles. Repeals the Secretary's authority to borrow under the Helium Act. Subtitle E: Territories - Terminates annual direct financial assistance to the Government of the Northern Mariana Islands. Title II: Agricultural Programs - Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1995 - Subtitle A: Extension and Modification of Various Commodity Programs - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 (Act) to extend loan, payment, and acreage reduction programs for wheat (including the food security wheat reserve), feed grains, cotton (including cottonseed and cottonseed oil), and rice.

Subtitle C: Peanuts - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to extend the peanut price support program.

(Sec. 2303) Revises sale, lease, or transfer of farm poundage quota provisions. Provides for: (1) quota transfers to other self-owned farms within the same State; and (2) quota sales within a State having quotas of 10,000 tons or more. (Sec. 2304) Subjects reentered (after export) peanut products made from additional peanuts to specified marketing penalties. (Sec. 2305) Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to limit price support rate increases or decreases. Establishes a special rule regarding New Mexico pools. Requires that all domestic and export peanuts comply with specified quality standards. (Sec. 2306) Requires an annual quota peanut producer referendum regarding the poundage quota. Subtitle D: Tobacco - Amends the Agricultural Act of 1949 to extend tobacco marketing assessment authority. States that such fees shall be used to pay for other tobacco programs not covered by user fees or other specified assessments or contributions. (Sec. 2402) Amends the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to revise farm acreage allotment and marketing quota reduction provisions. (Sec. 2403) Makes a specified farm reconstitution provision applicable to burley (burley) tobacco.
