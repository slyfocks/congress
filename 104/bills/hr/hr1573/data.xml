  <summary>5/3/1995--Introduced.
Gun Retention Act of 1995 - Amends the Federal criminal code to set penalties for knowingly taking or attempting to take a firearm from a law enforcement officer against that officer's will while such officer is engaged in the performance of official duties. Imposes: (1) a fine and ten to 15 years' imprisonment for such an offense other than an attempt or for such an offense that is an attempt during which the firearm is discharged (other than intentionally by the officer); and (2) a fine and five to ten years' imprisonment for any other offense that is an attempt. Prohibits such a term of imprisonment from running concurrently with any other term imposed with respect to the same criminal episode.</summary>
