  <summary>2/15/1995--Introduced.
Missing Service Personnel Act of 1995 - Requires the military commander of the unit, facility, or area to which the following persons are assigned to conduct an investigation as to their whereabouts after receiving factual information that their status is uncertain: (1) military personnel who disappear during a period of war, national emergency, or hostilities; and (2) any civilian Federal employee (including an employee of a Federal contractor) who serves with or accompanies an armed force in the field during such a period. Requires such persons to be placed in a missing status and requires notification of such status to either the officer having general court-martial authority over the person (for military personnel) or the Secretary of the military department employing such person (for civilian and contractor employees). Requires such officials to be kept informed (specifies deadlines) as to all information and inquiries concerning efforts to locate such missing personnel. Requires such officials to appoint a board to conduct an inquiry into the whereabouts and status of such persons. Provides for: (1) board composition, activities, and access to information; (2) inquiry proceedings (requiring the appointment of counsel, with specified duties, to represent the missing person); (3) a board recommendation as to the official status of a person following such an inquiry; (4) board reports to the officials involved as to board conclusions (prohibiting public availability of such reports for a one-year period); (5) report review by the official; (6) a report from such official to interested persons; and (7) an additional investigation and inquiry by an additional board upon receipt of new information within one year after the date of the first official notice of a person's disappearance. Allows interested persons (family members, dependents, next of kin) to participate at the proceedings of the board during such additional inquiry. Provides for the availability of appropriate information to board personnel conducting investigations and inquiries. Provides similar procedures for the second board with respect to meetings (open to the public, with exceptions), recommendations, reports, review by the Secretary of the military department concerned, and reports to interested persons. Directs the Secretary concerned: (1) if information becomes available on the whereabouts or status of a missing person within three years after the first official notice of the person's disappearance, to appoint a board to conduct an inquiry into such information; and (2) to appoint a board to conduct an inquiry as to the status of any missing person on or about three years after the first official notice of the disappearance of such person and not later than every three years thereafter until a total of 12 years after the first official notice. Allows certain interested persons to request the Secretary to appoint a board to review the status of a person declared dead before five years after the enactment of this Act. Limits the review subjects to those whose deaths were declared to have occurred on or after December 7, 1941. Provides for the conditions under which an appointed board may recommend that a person be declared dead. Requires the Secretary concerned to ensure that the personnel file of each person covered contains all information in possession of the Government relating to the disappearance and whereabouts or status of such person. Provides for judicial review of a person's declared status under this Act. Requires a person in a missing status or previously declared dead who is subsequently found alive to be paid for the full time of their absence. Requires the Secretary concerned, upon the enlistment of a person in an armed force, to require such person to specify in writing the individual(s) to whom information on their whereabouts or status shall be provided in the event of an investigation under this Act. Allows for revision of such choice by the enlisting individual.</summary>
