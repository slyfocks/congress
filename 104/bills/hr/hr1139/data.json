Requires the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to establish standards and procedures to ensure opportunity for public participation in the preparation of any plan for Atlantic striped bass management. Amends the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act to: (1) mandate cooperation with States and other non-Federal interests in conducting studies of the effects of water quality and other habitat changes on the recruitment, spawning potential, mortality rates, and population abundance of the Delaware River striped bass population (current law mandates such cooperation in three other studies); and (2) authorize appropriations to carry out such studies."
