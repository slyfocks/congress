  <summary>6/12/1996--Introduced.
Mail Fraud Prevention Act - Prohibits the Postal Service from accepting a change-of-address order unless appropriate photographic evidence of the addressee's identity is presented at the time of submission. Requires regulations to carry out this Act to: (1) include provisions under which this Act may be waived in the case of persons who are homebound (requires alternative measures to be implemented to carry out this Act with respect to such persons); and (2) provide for such other exclusions or modifications as the Postal Service considers appropriate, consistent with this Act's purpose and considerations of practicability.</summary>
