  <summary>9/5/1996--Introduced.
New Jersey Marine Ecosystem Protection Act of 1996 - Prohibits the transport of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters at the New York Bight Dredged Material Disposal Site (Mud Dump Site), other than for remediation pursuant to this Act, on and after September 1, 1997. Prohibits, after the date of this Act's enactment, the transport of: (1) dredged material for such purpose, other than Category I or II dredged material; and (2) Category II dredged material for such purpose unless the applicant for a transport permit has certified, and the Secretary of the Army has published a finding, that the affected States or ports were requested to provide alternate disposal sites and failed to provide a reasonable alternative site, and that dumping at the Mud Dump Site will not increase the elevation of the ocean bottom at such Site beyond a certain point. Directs: (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a remediation and restoration plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for the Mud Dump Site and surrounding areas and to designate such Site and areas that have been used for disposal of contaminated material as the Historic Area Remediation Site (to be managed as specified); and (2) the Secretary and Administrator to modify environmental assessment activities at the Mud Dump Site as appropriate to reflect the provisions of this Act. Prohibits the transport of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters in the New York Bight Apex outside the Historic Area Remediation Site, or into waters of the New York-New Jersey Harbor on and after September 1, 1997. Prohibits the Administrator from designating any new site for ocean dumping of dredged material within the Apex, and the Secretary from issuing any permit for transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it in the Apex, except in accordance with this Act. Prescribes penalties for violations of this Act. Directs the Secretary to establish, operate, and maintain a confined dredged material disposal facility or facilities within the confines of the Port of New York and New Jersey. Authorizes appropriations.</summary>
