    "text": "Women Veterans' Health Act of 1996 - Specifies the services to be included as women's health services in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Allows those services provided on an ambulatory or outpatient basis to be procured by contract when Department facilities are not capable of furnishing economical hospital care or medical services because of geographical inaccessibility or otherwise. (Sec. 3) Makes permanent (currently terminates on December 31, 1998) a Department program providing sexual trauma counseling and treatment to women veterans. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to report to the veterans' committees on the provision of health care services and the conduct of research carried out by the Department relating to women veterans. Requires such report to be prepared through the Center for Women Veterans. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary to waive a requirement that women and other minority veterans be included as subjects in Department clinical health research. Directs the Secretary to foster and encourage research on specified gender-specific matters relating to women (breast cancer, gynecological and reproductive health, and sexual trauma), as well as non-gender-specific matters (HIV and AIDS, substance abuse, aging, and cardiac care). Requires certain Department personnel to be involved in such research. (Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary to study and report to the veterans' committees concerning the needs of women veterans for health care services. Requires a representative sampling of all categories of women veterans in such study. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary to ensure that: (1) homeless women veterans are included in homeless veterans' outreach programs and services; and (2) women veterans who receive Department psychiatric treatment, especially for sexual trauma, receive such treatment in a safe and effective manner that recognizes their privacy needs. (Sec. 9) Makes applicable to Department mammography services and facilities the mammography quality standards promulgated under the Public Health Service Act. Extends the deadline for meeting such requirements. (Sec. 10) Requires, with respect to the Center for Women Veterans: (1) adequate clerical support to carry out the functions of the Director of the Center; and (2) an Associate Director."
