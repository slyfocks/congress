  <summary>04/24/1996--Introduced.
Amends Federal law to deny annuity or retirement pay to a Member of Congress convicted of a State or Federal felony which was committed: (1) while the individual was a Member of Congress (including a Delegate to Congress); and (2) after the enactment of this Act. Makes this prohibition applicable with respect to such offenses after the date of the conviction. Denies annuity benefits to an individual who willfully remains outside the United States or its territories and possessions for more than one year with knowledge of his or her indictment or charges, whichever the case may be. Sets forth provisions regarding the refund, under specified conditions, of contributions and deposits made for annuity benefits by such individuals, including contributions into the Thrift Savings Plan. Authorizes the restoration of such annuity if the individual is pardoned by the Governor in the case of a felony under State law.</summary>
