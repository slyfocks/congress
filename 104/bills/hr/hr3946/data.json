Title II: Constitutional and Human Rights Violations - Grants the district courts exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims for money damages based on constitutional torts. Authorizes the head of each Federal agency to compromise and settle any claim for money damages based on a constitutional tort, except that any award, compromise, or settlement in excess of $25,000 shall be effected only with the Attorney General's prior written approval. Sets forth provisions regarding limits on the liability of the United States, disposition by a Federal agency as a prerequisite to court action, jury trial requirements, the effect of certain judgments as a bar to an action, the Attorney General's authority to compromise such a claim, attorney's fees, exclusiveness of remedy, and administrative action concerning the responsible employee when a judgment is awarded against, or a settlement is paid by, the United States. Establishes a statute of limitations of: (1) three years for claims arising out of unlawful human experimentation; and (2) two years for claims against the United States for money damages based on a constitutional tort, with exceptions."
