Requires: (1) the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on such projects; and (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make specified payments to States for each project participant in the State who gets off AFDC or SSI and obtains unsubsidized private employment. Title II: Expansion of State Authority - Amends part A (AFDC) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to provide for expanded State authority with regard to: (1) contracting for case management and job training services; (2) benefit determinations for children conceived by AFDC recipients; and (3) treatment of families based on the number of parents in the home. Title III: Individual Development Accounts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide for individual development accounts (IDAs), that are generally tax-exempt, for low-income individuals to use for keeping their savings and other contributions up to a certain limit for educational, first-home purchase, and other specified purposes. Title IV: Other Asset Reforms - Amends SSA title IV to make various specified changes with regard to asset (including automobile equity) limits and dependent child income, resource, and IDA disregards. Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to exclude certain income from consideration for purposes of public housing rent determinations. Provides that amounts in IDAs shall be disregarded in determining eligibility for and amount of benefits under Federal welfare programs."
