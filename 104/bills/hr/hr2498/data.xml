  <summary>10/18/1995--Introduced.
Foreign Agents Compulsory Ethics in Trade Act of 1993 - Amends Federal criminal code restrictions on the activities of certain former officers, employees, and elected officials of the Federal Government (subject individuals) relating to foreign entities to make the following changes. Makes the current one-year ban a permanent one where the subject individual, after his or her termination from service, knowingly acts as an agent or attorney for or otherwise represents or advises, for compensation, a foreign government or political party in a matter to which such representation or advice directly relates, and in which the United States is either a party or has a direct and substantial interest. Replaces the current one-year post-Federal service ban with a five-year ban where the entity represented or advised for compensation would be: (1) a person outside the United States, unless such person is a U.S. citizen domiciled within the United States, or, if not an individual, is organized under or created by Federal or State law, or law of any other place under U.S. jurisdiction, with its principal place of business within the United States; or (2) a partnership, association, corporation, or similar organization formed under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country. Subjects the President to both such bans. Eliminates the special rule for trade representatives (which would extend the current one-year ban to three years).</summary>
