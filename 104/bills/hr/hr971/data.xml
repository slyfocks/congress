Homeowners Empowerment and Protection Act of 1995 - Requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to establish uniform Federal agency procedures with respect to application and homeowner notice requirements for the conduct of activities that generate pollutants or other adverse impacts with the potential to reduce private home values. Directs each agency to: (1) require any person filing an application to conduct property impacting activity to provide affected homeowners with written notice; (2) provide a toll-free telephone number for homeowner response; and (3) investigate the proposed activity's impact on home values. Creates a homeowner right of action, including class action authority, for certain home value reductions.</summary>
