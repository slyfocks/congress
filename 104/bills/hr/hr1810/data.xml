  <summary>6/8/1995--Introduced.
Federal Prison Health Services Privatization Act of 1995 - Revises Federal criminal code provisions regarding medical services in prisons to direct the Attorney General to: (1) provide for necessary medical care for prisoners in Federal penal and correctional institutions through contracts with non-governmental entities specializing in prison health services or correctional managed health care; and (2) establish a system of requiring copayments by prisoners within those institutions for health care. Authorizes: (1) the deduction of such copayments from commissary accounts or other similar credits given to prisoners for work; and (2) advances against such credits for the purposes of paying the copayment. Permits such copayments to be paid only after the prisoner has received essential medical care. Prohibits the denial to a prisoner of essential medical care because of the inability to pay such a copayment.</summary>
