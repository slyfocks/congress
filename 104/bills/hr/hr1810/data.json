Authorizes: (1) the deduction of such copayments from commissary accounts or other similar credits given to prisoners for work; and (2) advances against such credits for the purposes of paying the copayment. Permits such copayments to be paid only after the prisoner has received essential medical care. Prohibits the denial to a prisoner of essential medical care because of the inability to pay such a copayment."
