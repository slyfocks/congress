  <summary>2/10/1995--Introduced.
High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 - Prohibits high seas fishing vessels from harvesting operations on the high seas without authorization from the Secretary of Commerce. Provides for notification of the flag nation and investigation of a foreign vessel reasonably suspected of activities undermining the effectiveness of international conservation and management measures. Makes it unlawful for any person to use a high seas vessel: (1) unless authorized by the Secretary; or (2) in contravention of international conservation and management measures. Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to declare that the Congress finds that sufficient U.S. harvesting capacity exists and will continue to exist at least through 1999 in the Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel fisheries so that no surplus exists in those fisheries under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Prohibits any allocation of such fisheries before March 17, 1999.</summary>
