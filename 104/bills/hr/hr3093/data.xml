  <summary>3/14/1996--Introduced.
Amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a program to provide loans for the environmental assessment and remediation of brownfield sites, with specified exceptions. Defines a "brownfield site" as a parcel of land that contains or contained abandoned or under-used commercial or industrial facilities, the expansion or redevelopment of which is complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances. Authorizes the Administrator, upon approval of an application and with the consent of the State and local governments with jurisdiction over the site, to make separate loans for site characterization and assessment and for response action (for purposes of making the site or sites available for manufacturing, business, or other commercial or residential purposes). Directs the Administrator to establish a system for the ranking of applications for assistance.</summary>
