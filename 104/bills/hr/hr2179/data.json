    "text": "International Dolphin Conservation Act Amendments of 1995 - Amends the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to replace provisions relating to a global moratorium to prohibit certain tuna harvesting practices with provisions declaring that it is U.S. policy to: (1) continue progress in reducing incidental mortality of dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean yellowfin tuna fishery; (2) support the International Dolphin Conservation Program; and (3) authorize participation of U.S. tuna fishing vessels in the fishery of that area in a manner consistent with the Program and this Act. Authorizes regulations on the incidental taking of marine mammals during commercial purse seine yellowfin tuna fishing in that area. Requires all vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction engaged in such fishing in that area to carry a certified observer to conduct research and observe fishing operations. Makes it unlawful to: (1) violate any regulation under these provisions; (2) resist, intimidate, or interfere with boarding or inspection by an authorized officer; or (3) intentionally set a purse seine net on any marine mammal during tuna fishing in that area. Imposes civil and criminal penalties and civil forfeitures. Revises the requirements applicable to nations exporting yellowfin tuna to the United States. Repeals the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act."
