  <summary>9/19/1996--Introduced.
Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1996 - Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to modify the definition of "religion" to include all aspects of religious observance, practice, and belief unless an employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate a religious observance or practice without undue hardship (action requiring significant difficulty or expense) on the conduct of the employer's business (as under current law) after initiating and engaging in an affirmative and bona fide effort. Sets forth the circumstances in which an accommodation by the employer shall not be deemed to be reasonable. Excludes, in certain circumstances, a defense that the accommodation would be in violation of a seniority system. Prohibits requiring payment of premium wages for work performed during hours to which premium wages would ordinarily be applicable if work is performed during those hours only to accommodate religious requirements of an employee.</summary>
