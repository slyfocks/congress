Authorizes lump sum payments of up to $25,000 each to no more than 100 AID employees to the extent necessary to eliminate the positions and functions identified by the strategic plan. Requires AID to deposit in the Treasury to the credit of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to 15 percent of the final basic pay of each employee to whom a voluntary separation incentive payment is paid. Requires repayment of any voluntary separation incentive payment by an individual who accepts any subsequent employment with the Government within five years after the date of separation. Mandates a reduction in total full-time equivalent positions of AID by one for each employee receiving a voluntary separation incentive payment."
