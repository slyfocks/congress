    "text": "Recycling Information Clearinghouse Act of 1995 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a clearinghouse for information about the recycling of municipal solid waste to include: (1) a data base on the volume and rate of recycling of materials from the municipal solid waste stream; (2) an annual estimate of the balance of trade in recycled materials and products; (3) economic data comparing the costs and benefits of recycling various materials from the municipal solid waste stream; (4) a catalog of State and local laws that encourage or require the recycling of materials from the municipal solid waste stream; (5) a list of all purchases of recycled materials or products by the Federal Government; (6) a register announcing all solicitations by Federal agencies for the purchase of recycled materials or products; (7) information about state-of-the-art recycling methods, programs, and technologies; and (8) a register of all potential purchasers of recycled materials. Requires that a toll-free telephone hotline be made available to those seeking information from the clearinghouse. Makes a State ineligible for solid waste disposal assistance after December 31, 1996, unless the State maintains and publicizes a register of potential purchasers of recycled materials known to the State solid waste planning authorities. Authorizes appropriations."
