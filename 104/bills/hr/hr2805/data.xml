  <summary>12/18/1995--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to hospital insurance benefits for uninsured elderly individuals not otherwise eligible. Repeals the requirement for annual estimation of the monthly actuarial rate for the succeeding year, and the requirement that the monthly premium be equal to such rate. Requires, instead, that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determine annually the dollar amount applicable for such premiums in the succeeding year, without further legislative guidelines. Sets a special premium rate for individuals age 80 or older, whose monthly rate shall be: (1) $100 in 1996; and (2) in subsequent years, the monthly rate for the previous year increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers.</summary>
