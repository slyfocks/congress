Exempts plans maintained by tax-exempt qualified medical entities from the reduction of the limit under such provisions for other elective deferrals. Limits the maximum amount of compensation of any one participant which may be deferred under a qualified excess benefit arrangement to an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1) $25,000; or (2) 33 and one-third percent of the participant's includible compensation. Defines \"qualified excess benefit arrangement.\""
