TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: General Provisions Title II: Federal Aviation Administration Streamlining Programs Title III: System to Fund Certain Federal Aviation Administration Functions Air Traffic Management System Performance Improvement Act of 1995 - Title I: General Provisions - Amends Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to delineate the powers and duties of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the FAA. (Sec. 104) Authorizes the Administrator to issue, rescind, and revise regulations as necessary to carry out the FAA functions. Prohibits the Administrator, without prior approval of the Secretary, from issuing a proposed or final regulation that is significant or is likely to result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $50 million or more in any year. Excepts emergency regulations from such prohibition, but subjects them to rescission if the Secretary fails to ratify them. Requires the Administrator to review any unusually burdensome regulations, which would result in the annual expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $25 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any year. (Sec. 105) Authorizes the Administrator to utilize personnel of other Federal agencies. (Sec. 107) Amends Federal transportation law to revise FAA budget provisions to require the Administrator, after the first fiscal year in which the FAA is funded entirely by user fees, to prepare a budget for the FAA for each fiscal year. Directs the Secretary to review such budget, recommending modifications to it to ensure consistency with the needs of the national transportation system. (Sec. 110) Directs the Administrator to establish a select panel to review and report to the Congress regarding a limited innovative program to fund specific facilities and equipment projects, and to provide limited additional funding alternatives for airport capacity development. (Sec. 112) Directs the Administrator to establish the Federal Aviation Management Advisory Council which shall: (1) provide advice and counsel to the Administrator on issues which affect or are affected by the Administrator's operations; and (2) function as an oversight resource for management, policy, spending, and regulatory matters. (Sec. 113) Requires the Administrator, in order to protect the public health and welfare from aircraft engine emissions, to prescribe air pollutant emission standards for aircraft engines. Title II: Federal Aviation Administration Streamlining Programs - Directs the Administrator to develop an innovative program for air traffic control modernization using an acquisition management system for FAA procurement of goods and services. (Sec. 202) Requires the Administrator to terminate programs funded under the Facilities and Equipment account, and to consider the termination of substantial acquisitions, that fail meet specified established project criteria. (Sec. 203) Directs the Administrator to develop an innovative personnel management system for the management, compensation, and advancement of FAA employees. Title III: System to Fund Certain Federal Aviation Administration Functions - Directs the FAA to submit to the Congress a performance- based fee system for various FAA services. (Sec. 303) Directs the FAA to enter into an agreement with the Department of Defense (DOD) for the reimbursement to the FAA of the net cost of air traffic control services provided to DOD. (Sec. 304) Directs the FAA to submit to the Congress a proposed fee system for air traffic control services. (Sec. 306) Increases for FY 1998 and 1999 Airport and Airway Trust Fund spending caps for certain direct costs for air navigation facilities and joint air navigation services. (Sec. 307) Requires the multiyear appropriation of funds (not less than three years) for Trust Fund activities.</summary>
