Expresses the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock births are important Government interests and that the policy in this title is intended to address such interests. (Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a single program of block grants to the States for operating statewide temporary assistance (TEA) programs with certain mandatory work, education, and job preparation requirements for needy families either already with or expecting a child, which are designed to assist such families in becoming self-sufficient. Limits such families generally to no more than five years of TEA cash assistance, with certain exceptions for minor children, battered family members, and hardship situations. Denies TEA assistance in cases where an individual family member is a fugitive felon or a probation or parole violator and in certain other specified situations as well. Denies cash assistance for minor children born into families on TEA assistance who already have a child (except in cases involving children born as a result of rape or incest), unless a State opts out of such denial policy. Requires, in addition, certain mandatory adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents. Provides for the exchange of TEA program information with law enforcement agencies under certain conditions. Penalizes States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments, allowing States to terminate such payments to certain adult family members without small children needing child care who refuse to engage in work, educational, or job preparation activities (required program activities) or cooperate with the State in establishing child support. Provides for a separate reduction in State TEA grant payments for States failing to comply with Federal requirements under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity). Sets forth the mechanism for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State plans or imposition of penalties, providing for advance notification of any program violation and the opportunity for a State to correct it before any such penalty is imposed. Limits the amount of any penalty reduction in the State's quarterly grant payment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that State TEA programs should: (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in required program activities; and (2) require noncustodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. Specifies State TEA plan contents, including provisions for numeric goals for reducing illegitimacy in the State over a specified ten year period beginning in 1996, and certain certifications by the State that it will operate child support enforcement and protection programs, in order for the State to be eligible (along with certain other criteria which it must meet as well) to receive Federal TEA grants. Allows the States to decide in their TEA plans: (1) whether or not they intend on providing TEA assistance to aliens; and (2) how to treat families moving interstate. Details grant administrative provisions: (1) determining the amounts of State grants; (2) outlining grant uses, such as those for family planning services; (3) providing additional grants to States for reductions in illegitimate births, as well as supplemental grants to certain States for population increases; and (4) establishing a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs in the Treasury for payments to certain eligible States. Makes appropriations: (1) for State family assistance grants for FY 1996 through 2001; (2) for grants to reward States that reduce out- of-wedlock births for FY 1998 and following fiscal years; (3) supplemental grants for population increases in certain States for FY 1997 through 2000; and (4) for the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs for FY 1997 through 2001. Sets up a Federal loan program for State TEA programs for anti- fraud and other specified activities. Makes necessary appropriations. Outlines specific program data collection and reporting requirements as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements, among other things requiring quarterly reports by the States on family case record information and research by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the benefits, effects, and costs of operating different State TEA programs. Provides for direct funding, by way of three-year tribal family assistance grants, to Indian tribes (including Indian tribes in Alaska) for tribal administration of TEA programs. Directs the Bureau of the Census to expand the Survey of Income and Program Participation as necessary to obtain information that will enable interested persons to evaluate the impact of the changes made by this title on a random national sample of recipients of assistance under State programs funded under this title, and on other appropriate low-income families. Provides for the treatment of existing State AFDC waivers in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act and those granted subsequently. Makes the HHS Assistant Secretary for Family Support the official responsible for administering SSA title IV part A and D programs. (Sec. 104) Allows States to contract with charitable, religious, and private organizations to provide services and administer programs established or modified under titles I, II, and VI of this Act. Prohibits the expenditure of financial assistance provided under such programs for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization. (Sec. 105) Directs the Secretary of Commerce to expand census data collection efforts to enable the Bureau of the Census to collect statistically significant data on grandparent caregivers. (Sec. 106) Requires an HHS report to the Congress on State automated data processing systems used in administering SSA title IV part A programs to determine what would be required to establish a system for tracking public program participants and checking case records to determine if such participants are participating in public programs of two or more States. (Sec. 107) Details requirements for a similar report, and study, on alternative outcomes measures for evaluating the success of the States in moving individuals off welfare through employment. (Sec. 108) Makes conforming amendments to SSA, the Food Stamp Act of 1977, and related provisions of other specified Federal laws. (Sec. 111) Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to: (1) develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant social security card; and (2) study and issue a report to the Congress with regard to improving the social security card application process. (Sec. 112) Requires any organization accepting Federal funds under this Act to disclose that fact in any communication it makes that in any way intends to promote public support or opposition to any Federal, State, or local government policy through any broadcasting station, periodical, or other specified type of general public advertising. Makes any organization failing to make such a disclosure ineligible to receive Federal funds under this Act. (Sec. 113) Amends the Family Support Act of 1988 to remove the \"demonstration\" status of the Job Opportunities for Certain Low-Income Individuals (JOLI) program and give it an increased annual authorization for any fiscal year. (Sec. 114) Gives States the option of determining the Medicaid eligibility of TEA program and other recipients of aid or assistance under various other specified social security programs, including the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program under SSA title XVI, as long as resulting Federal expenditures do not exceed those that would have been made under Medicaid had not this Act been enacted. Title II: Supplemental Security Income - Subtitle A: Eligibility Restrictions - Amends SSA title XVI to deny SSI for ten years to individuals found to have fraudulently misrepresented residence in order to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more States. Denies SSI for fugitive felons and probation and parole violators. Provides for exchange of SSI information with law enforcement agencies under certain conditions. Subtitle B: Benefits for Disabled Children - Revises the rules with respect to childhood eligibility, with corresponding changes to childhood SSI regulations modifying the medical criteria for evaluation of mental and emotional disorders, and discontinuing the use of individualized functional assessments for children. Modifies medical improvement review standards, specifically dividing their applicability to, and creating separate criteria for individuals aged 18 or older, and individuals under age 18, respectively. (Sec. 211) Provides that once an eligible child meets the definition of disability, the amount of the individual's cash benefit will be based on whether or not the child meets criteria for needing personal assistance enabling the child to stay at home with his or her family. Authorizes appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations under SSI. (Sec. 212) Provides that at least once every three years the Commissioner shall review the continued SSI eligibility of each individual who has not attained 18 years of age and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment (or combination of impairments) which may improve (or, at the option of the Commissioner, which is unlikely to improve). Requires a representative payee of a recipient whose case is so reviewed to present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, for the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under the SSI program. Provides that if the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with such requirement, the Commissioner shall, if in the individual's best interest, promptly terminate payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual would be served thereby, to the individual. Provides that if an individual is eligible for SSI benefits by reason of disability for the month preceding the month in which the individual attains age 18, the Commissioner shall redetermine such eligibility: (1) during the one-year period beginning on the individual's 18th birthday; and (2) by applying the criteria used in determining the initial eligibility for applicants who have attained age 18. Specifies requirements governing continuing disability reviews for low-birth-weight babies. (Sec. 213) Revises provisions regarding the disposal of resources for less than fair market value by certain individuals and appropriate notification of Medicaid. Adds provisions for the treatment of assets held in trust by individuals who have not attained age 18 and any earnings resulting from such trust. Requires representative payees of eligible individuals below age 18 to establish financial institution accounts on behalf of such individuals into which such individuals' SSI payments shall be paid. Allows representative payees to use funds in the account to pay for certain allowable expenses. Directs the Commissioner of Social Security to establish a system for accountability monitoring whereby such representative payee shall report on activities respecting funds in the account. (Sec. 214) Reduces cash SSI payments to institutionalized children whose medical costs are covered by private insurance. Subtitle C: State Supplementation Programs - Repeals maintenance of effort requirements applicable to optional State programs for supplementation of SSI benefits. Subtitle D: Studies Regarding Supplemental Security Income Program - Requires the Commissioner of Social Security to prepare an annual report for the President and the Congress on the SSI program, and make appropriate arrangements for a study of the disability determination process under SSA titles II and XVI for any needed changes. (Sec. 233) Outlines the requirements for a study and report by the General Accounting Office on the impact of this title on SSA title XVI (SSI) and on the extra expenses incurred by families of children receiving benefits under such title that are not covered by other Federal, State, or local programs. Subtitle E: National Commission on the Future of Disability - Establishes the National Commission on the Future of Disability to develop and carry out a comprehensive study of all matters related to the nature, purpose, and adequacy of all Federal programs serving individuals with disabilities in order to develop appropriate recommendations for any needed legislation or administrative action. Authorizes appropriations. Subtitle F: Retirement Age Eligibility - Provides that, for purposes of determining an aged individual under SSI, the age used shall be the retirement age used under the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Program under SSA title II. Title III: Child Support - Subtitle A: Eligibility for Services; Distribution of Payments - Amends part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of SSA title IV to require State plans for child and spousal support to provide: (1) certain services relating to paternity establishment or enforcement of child support obligations; and (2) continuation of services for families ceasing to receive assistance under Aid to Families with Dependent Children. (Sec. 302) Revises payment distribution guidelines for support obligations collected by the State on behalf of a family. Requires a study and report to the Congress on the effectiveness of the distribution of pre-assistance and post-assistance arrearages in moving people off welfare and in keeping them off.

Permits the linking of local registries. (Sec. 312) Requires State plans to include a unit to monitor and enforce collection and disbursement of support payments. (Sec. 313) Requires State plans to: (1) provide for a State- operated State Directory of New Hires containing prescribed information furnished by employers on new personnel; and (2) transmit such information to the National Directory of New Hires. (Sec. 314) Requires States to have statutorily prescribed procedures: (1) for mandatory income withholding for support payments subject to enforcement; and (2) under which child support orders issued before October 1, 1996, shall become subject to withholding from wages if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing.
