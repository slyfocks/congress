Expresses the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock births are important Government interests and that the policy in this title is intended to address such interests. (Sec. 103) Replaces the current Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program under title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) with a single program of block grants to the States for operating statewide temporary assistance (TEA) programs with certain mandatory work, education, and job preparation requirements for needy families either already with or expecting a child, which are designed to assist such families in becoming self-sufficient. Limits such families generally to no more than five years of TEA cash assistance, with certain exceptions for minor children, battered family members, and hardship situations. Denies TEA assistance in cases where an individual family member is a fugitive felon or a probation or parole violator and in certain other specified situations as well. Denies cash assistance for minor children born into families on TEA assistance who already have a child (except in cases involving children born as a result of rape or incest), unless a State opts out of such denial policy. Requires, in addition, certain mandatory adult-supervised living arrangements for unmarried teenage parents. Provides for the exchange of TEA program information with law enforcement agencies under certain conditions. Penalizes States and individual families for specified grant and program violations, respectively, through reduced grants and assistance payments, allowing States to terminate such payments to certain adult family members without small children needing child care who refuse to engage in work, educational, or job preparation activities (required program activities) or cooperate with the State in establishing child support. Provides for a separate reduction in State TEA grant payments for States failing to comply with Federal requirements under SSA title IV part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity). Sets forth the mechanism for State appeal of Federal adverse decisions with respect to State plans or imposition of penalties, providing for advance notification of any program violation and the opportunity for a State to correct it before any such penalty is imposed. Limits the amount of any penalty reduction in the State's quarterly grant payment. Expresses the sense of the Congress that State TEA programs should: (1) assign the highest priority to requiring adults in two-parent families and in single-parent families with older preschool or school-age children to be engaged in required program activities; and (2) require noncustodial, nonsupporting parents under age 18 to fulfill community work obligations and attend appropriate parenting or money management classes after school. Specifies State TEA plan contents, including provisions for numeric goals for reducing illegitimacy in the State over a specified ten year period beginning in 1996, and certain certifications by the State that it will operate child support enforcement and protection programs, in order for the State to be eligible (along with certain other criteria which it must meet as well) to receive Federal TEA grants. Allows the States to decide in their TEA plans: (1) whether or not they intend on providing TEA assistance to aliens; and (2) how to treat families moving interstate. Details grant administrative provisions: (1) determining the amounts of State grants; (2) outlining grant uses, such as those for family planning services; (3) providing additional grants to States for reductions in illegitimate births, as well as supplemental grants to certain States for population increases; and (4) establishing a Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs in the Treasury for payments to certain eligible States.

Outlines specific program data collection and reporting requirements as well as certain research, evaluation, and study requirements, among other things requiring quarterly reports by the States on family case record information and research by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the benefits, effects, and costs of operating different State TEA programs. Provides for direct funding, by way of three-year tribal family assistance grants, to Indian tribes (including Indian tribes in Alaska) for tribal administration of TEA programs.

Provides for the treatment of existing State AFDC waivers in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act and those granted subsequently.

Authorizes appropriations for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations under SSI.

Requires a representative payee of a recipient whose case is so reviewed to present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, for the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under the SSI program. Provides that if the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with such requirement, the Commissioner shall, if in the individual's best interest, promptly terminate payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual would be served thereby, to the individual.
