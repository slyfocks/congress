TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Title II: Veterans Affairs Title III: Title IV: Title V: Clarification of Certain Reimbursements Title I: - Makes appropriations for FY 1996 to continue the following activities: (1) certain nutrition services for the elderly under the Administration on Aging in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); (2) certain grants to States for child welfare services, all Federal Parent Locator Service activities, family support payments to States (including administrative activities), and payments to States for foster care and adoption assistance (including administrative activities) under the Administration for Children and Families in HHS; (3) all State unemployment insurance administration activities under the Employment and Training Administration in the Department of Labor, and certain railroad unemployment insurance administration activities of the Railroad Retirement Board; (4) all general welfare assistance payments and foster care payments under the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior; (5) all projects and activities necessary for visitors and visitor services in the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuges, the National Forests, the facilities operated by the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the United States Holocaust Memorial; and (6) all State Department projects and activities necessary to process visas and passports and to provide for American citizen services. (Sec. 101) Requires funding of such activities at the lower of the current FY 1995 rate, or the rate in an FY 1996 appropriations bill as passed by only the House or only the Senate (or the lower of two differing rates as contained in the House-passed or the Senate-passed version of an FY 1996 appropriations bill), as of enactment of this Act. (Sec. 106) Declares that appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this title shall be available until the earlier of: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this title; (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) September 30, 1996 (March 15, 1996, in the case of certain projects and activities relating to family support payments to States and payments to States for foster care and adoption assistance). (Sec. 110) Commences the coverage of this title as of December 16, 1995. Title II: Veterans Affairs - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, if FY 1996 appropriations are not otherwise available, to ensure: (1) payment of existing veterans benefits; and (2) payments when due to contractors of the Veterans Health Administration for services provided which directly relate to patient health and safety. (Sec. 201) Makes appropriations for such payments. (Sec. 203) Commences the coverage of this title as of January 4, 1996. Title III: - Makes FY 1996 appropriations to pay the salaries of Federal employees excepted from the Antideficiency Act who are continuing projects and activities conducted in FY 1995 and work during periods when there is otherwise no funding authority for their salaries. (Sec. 306) Declares that appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this title shall be available until the earlier of: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this title; (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) January 26, 1996. (Sec. 310) Amends Federal law with respect to the general restriction against acceptance by a Federal or a District of Columbia (D.C.) government officer or employee of voluntary services for either government, or employment of personal services exceeding that authorized by law, except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property (essential employees). Deems all Federal and D.C. government officers and employees to be performing such emergency services (thus deeming them all to be essential employees). Limits the duration of such amendment to the period December 15, 1995, through January 26, 1996. Deems any Federal employees returning to work under this provision to have returned at the first regularly scheduled opportunity after December 15, 1995. (Sec. 311) Declares that Federal employees considered excepted from furlough during any period in which there is a lapse in appropriations with respect to the agency activity in which the employee is engaged shall not be considered to be furloughed when on leave, and shall be subject to the same leave regulations as if no lapse in appropriations had occurred. (Sec. 312) Declares that, beginning on January 2, 1996, any Federal employee excepted from furlough who is not being paid due to a lapse in appropriations shall be deemed to be totally separated from Federal service and eligible for unemployment compensation benefits with no waiting period for such eligibility to accrue. (Sec. 313) Deems any Federal employees returning to work under this title to have returned at the first regularly scheduled opportunity after December 15, 1995. Title IV: - Makes appropriations for FY 1996 to continue projects and activities conducted in FY 1995 for which appropriations would be available in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1996. (Sec. 401) Requires funding of such activities at the current FY 1995 rate or a lower one determined according to specified legislative situations. (Sec. 406) Declares that appropriations and funds made available and authority granted pursuant to this title shall be available until the earlier of: (1) enactment into law of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in this title; (2) enactment into law of the applicable appropriations Act by both Houses without any provision for such project or activity; or (3) September 30, 1996. (Sec. 407) Declares that none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be expended for any abortion except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or where the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. (Sec. 411) Provides for rates of operations for certain existing activities at the minimal level, reduced from the current rate by 25 percent, that would enable them to continue. (Sec. 412) Provides that, whenever the rate for operations for any continuing project or activity under this title for which there is a budget request would result in a furlough of Government employees, such rate may be increased to the minimum level that would enable the furlough to be avoided. Limits the amounts for which new contracts or grants may be awarded. (Sec. 413) Provides that, for programs that had high initial rates of operation or complete distribution of funding at the beginning of FY 1995 because of distributions of funding to States, foreign countries, grantees, or others, similar funds distributions for FY 1996 shall not be made and no grants shall be awarded for such programs funded by this title that would impinge on final funding prerogatives. (Sec. 414) Requires implementation of this title in such a way that only the most limited funding action permitted by it shall be taken in order to provide for continuation of projects and activities. (Sec. 416) Prohibits the use of any funds appropriated under this title to implement or enforce any system of registration of unmarried, cohabiting couples whether they are homosexual, lesbian, or heterosexual, including but not limited to registration for the purpose of extending employment, health, or governmental benefits to such couples on the same basis they are extended to legally married couples. Prohibits the use of any funds made available under this title to implement or enforce D.C. Act 9-188, signed by the Mayor of the District of Columbia on April 15, 1992. Title V: Clarification of Certain Reimbursements - Declares that, if a State used State funds to continue carrying out a Federal program, or furloughed State employees whose compensation is advanced or reimbursed wholly or partly by the Federal Government, then: (1) such furloughed employees shall be compensated at their standard rate of compensation for such period; (2) the State shall be reimbursed for expenses that would have been paid by the Federal Government during such period had appropriations been available, including the cost of compensating such furloughed employees, plus interest; and (3) the State may use funds available to it under such Federal program to reimburse itself, plus interest. (Sec. 501) Applies the authority under this title with respect to any period in FY 1996 (not limited to periods beginning or ending after enactment of this Act) during which a lapse in appropriations occurs with respect to any Federal department or agency which, but for such lapse, would have paid, or made reimbursement relating to, any of such expenses with respect to the program involved. Limits such payments and reimbursements to the extent and in amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts.</summary>
