    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Reauthorization of and Amendments to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act Title II: Insular Areas Fishery Conservation and Management Amendments of 1995 - Title I: Reauthorization of and Amendments to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act - Amends the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) to make it U.S. policy to encourage development of practical measures that minimize bycatch. (Sec. 5) Authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue transshipment permits to foreign vessels engaged in fishing consisting solely of transporting fish products at sea from a point within the boundaries of any State or the exclusive economic zone to a point outside the United States to any applicant who meets specified requirements and pays a certain fee. Prohibits making an allocation to a foreign nation for a fishery that is not subject to a fishery management plan. Prohibits approving a foreign fishing application for Atlantic mackerel or Atlantic herring unless the appropriate Fishery Management Council has recommended approval. Requires any such approval to include the conditions and restrictions recommended by the Council. Extends the period for congressional review of a governing international fishing agreement from 60 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress to 120 calendar days (excluding any days in a period for which the Congress is adjourned sine die) after the date the President transmits it to the Congress. (Sec. 6) Requires the Secretary to submit to specified congressional committees an annual list of nations that authorize large-scale drift net fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation in a manner that diminishes the effectiveness of, or is inconsistent with, any international agreement governing large-scale drift net fishing to which the United States is a party. (Sec. 7) Sets as a national standard for fishery management plans that fishery conservation and management measures, to the maximum extent practicable, minimize bycatch. (Sec. 8) Adds North Carolina to the membership of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Fishery Management Council. Increases that Council's number of voting members and number of members appointed by the Secretary. Revises requirements regarding voting members, compensation, the transaction of business, Council comments on Federal or State agency action that may have a detrimental effect on essential fishery habitat, various procedural matters, and disclosure of financial interest and recusal. (Sec. 9) Revises mandatory and discretionary contents of fishery management plans. Directs the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to require fish processors and fish processing vessels to weigh fish to ensure an accurate measurement of the total harvest of each species. Requires that Fishery Impact Statements be submitted to possibly affected States and specified congressional committees. (Sec. 10) Requires the Secretary to establish a plan development team for each highly migratory species fishery to advise the Secretary on and participate in the development of each fishery management plan or amendment. Revises requirements applicable to conservation and management measures in any plan covering fisheries under the authority of more than one Council. Prohibits plans from establishing a limited access system unless approved by each appropriate Council or advisory committee (currently, each appropriate Council) appointed under laws implementing international fishery agreements. Makes permanent the program to assess the impact on fishery resources of incidental harvest by the shrimp trawl fishery. Mandates the completion of a program to develop and evaluate technological and other fishing operations changes to minimize incidental fishery resources mortality in shrimp trawling. (Current law mandates commencement of a similar program.) Requires any measure implemented to apply throughout the range of the fishery resource concerned. Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish guidelines to assist the Councils in describing essential fishery habitat in plans; (2) establish a schedule for amending plans to describe the habitats; and (3) identify the essential fishery habitat for each fishery that has a fishery management plan. Requires each Federal agency to consult with the Secretary regarding any action that may adversely modify such habitat. Requires the Secretary, at any time that overfishing is found to be occurring in any fishery, to: (1) immediately notify the appropriate Council; (2) request that action be taken to halt the overfishing; and (3) establish a program to rebuild the fishery. Requires the Secretary to prepare a plan or amendment addressing overfishing and rebuilding if the Council fails to do so. Mandates other reassessment and rebuilding measures.
