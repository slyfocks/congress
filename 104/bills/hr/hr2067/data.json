Provides that minor boundary revisions which only delete acreage from the national parks system may only be authorized by an Act of Congress. Title II: Authorization for Certain Park Facilities to be Located Outside of Units of the National Park System - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish essential facilities for park administration, visitor use, and park employee residential housing outside the boundaries, but within the vicinity, of national park system units. Allows the Secretary to lease or acquire land to develop essential facilities. Authorizes the Secretary to construct, operate, and maintain permanent and temporary buildings on land within the vicinity of the national park system after the Secretary has entered into a binding agreement with the owner of such land."
