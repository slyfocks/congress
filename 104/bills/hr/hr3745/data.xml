Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Corrections Act of 1996 - Modifies Federal criminal code provisions regarding the purchase of prison-made products by Federal departments to require each Federal department and agency to offer to purchase prison-made products in accordance with this Act. Specifies that: (1) when a procurement activity of a Federal department or agency has a requirement for a specific product that is authorized to be offered for sale by Federal Prison Industries (FPI) and is listed in the FPI catalog of products, the procurement activity shall solicit an offer from FPI; and (2) a contract award shall be made using competitive procedures in accordance with the specifications and evaluation factors specified in the solicitation, and may be made to FPI if the contracting officer for the procurement activity determines that the prison-made product to be furnished will meet the requirements of the procurement activity, timely performance of the contract can be reasonably expected, and the contract price does not exceed a current market price as established by the competition. Establishes provisions regarding: (1) contract performance by FPI; (2) finality of the contracting officer's decision; (3) reporting of purchases by Federal departments or agencies from FPI to the Federal Procurement Data System; and (4) publication and maintenance by FPI of a catalog of products and services that it is authorized to offer for sale. Sets forth provisions regarding proposed revisions to the Government-wide Federal Acquisition Regulation, publication of final regulations, and public participation in the process.</summary>
