Sets forth provisions regarding publication and filing requirements, legal effect, availability for public inspection, and reimbursement. Directs the Secretary of the Interior, during the period of the withdrawal, to manage the lands withdrawn under this Act pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and other applicable law. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) permitted management activities (wildlife and wildlife habitat protection, control of predatory and other animals, prevention and suppression of fires resulting from nonmilitary activities, and geothermal leasing and development and related power production, mineral leasing and development, and mineral material sales); (2) conditions on nonmilitary uses; (3) closure to the public; (4) additional military uses; (5) the June 29, 1987, cooperative agreement entered into between the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, and the Department of the Navy with regard to the defense-related uses of Federal lands to further the mission of El Centro; and (6) the duration of withdrawal and reservation, including a process for extension. Directs the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a program of decontamination of the lands withdrawn under this Act at least at the level of decontamination activities performed on such lands in FY 1986. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) early relinquishment of withdrawal; (2) delegation of functions; (3) hunting, fishing, and trapping; (4) immunity of the United States; and (5) termination of prior reclamation withdrawals.
