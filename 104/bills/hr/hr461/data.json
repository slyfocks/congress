Directs that any DC felon (excluding any individual convicted of a misdemeanor, as a juvenile offender, or any person detained pending trial in DC Superior Court) who is committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a term of imprisonment on or after the enactment date of this Act be incarcerated in a facility designated by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, in accordance with such rules as the Attorney General may establish to assure that the treatment of such felons is similar to that of others under the control of the Director. Sets forth transition provisions. Requires the Administrator to submit to the Congress an implementation plan for the closure of the Complex which shall identify actions with respect to the future use of the land on which the Complex is located and other specified issues. Establishes a Commission on Closure of the Lorton Correctional Complex. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) a process for submission of the final implementation plan; (2) review of the Commission's proposal; (3) comments by the Commission and its members on the plan to the Administrator; (4) submission of a final plan; (5) automatic implementation of the plan; (6) membership, terms, vacancies, compensation, powers, and termination of the Commission; and (7) staff, experts, and consultants to the Commission.
