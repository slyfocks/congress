  <summary>12/15/1995--Introduced.
Veterans Health Care Management and Contracting Flexibility Act of 1995 - Reduces from 90 to 45 days the required period of prior congressional notification after which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may implement an administrative reorganization within the Department of Veterans Affairs. Repeals a Federal provision which prohibits, with an exception, the Secretary from entering into a contract under which an activity at a Department health care facility currently performed by Federal employees is converted to one performed by employees of a Federal contractor. Authorizes the Secretary to enter into agreements with non-Department health care facilities and providers for the sharing of all health-care resources (currently, only specialized medical resources).</summary>
