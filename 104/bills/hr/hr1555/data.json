    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Development of Competitive Telecommunications Markets Title II: Cable Communications Competitiveness Title III: Broadcast Communications Competitiveness Title IV: Effect on Other Laws Title V: Definitions Title VI: Small Business Complaint Procedure Communications Act of 1995 - Title I: Development of Competitive Telecommunications Markets - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to provide that the duty of a common carrier includes the duty to interconnect with the facilities and equipment of other providers of telecommunications and information services. Includes within the duty of a local exchange carrier specified duties with respect to providing: (1) interconnection; (2) unbundling of network elements; (3) services, elements, features, and capabilities (services) for resale at economically feasible rates to the reseller (establishes a duty to offer services for resale at wholesale rates and not to prohibit or impose unreasonable or discriminatory conditions or limitations on the resale of such services, on a bundled or unbundled basis, except that a carrier may prohibit a reseller that obtains at wholesale rates a service that is available at retail only to a category of subscribers from offering such service to a different category of subscribers); (4) number portability; (5) dialing parity; (6) access to rights-of-way; (7) network functionality and accessibility; and (8) good faith negotiation of agreements to fulfill such duties. Requires a local exchange carrier to provide, to any other carrier or person offering (or seeking to offer) a telecommunications or information service: (1) access to and interconnection with the facilities of the carrier's network at any technically feasible and economically reasonable point within the carrier's network on just and reasonable terms and conditions, upon request; and (2) reasonable and nondiscriminatory access on an unbundled basis to databases, signaling systems, poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way owned or controlled by a local carrier that is equal to that afforded by the carrier to itself or to any other person and is available at nondiscriminatory prices and that is sufficient to ensure the full interoperability of the equipment and facilities of the carrier and of the person seeking such access. Directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish regulations to implement requirements under this title within six months. Prohibits the FCC from precluding the enforcement of any regulation, order, or policy of a State commission that establishes access and interconnection obligations of local exchange carriers, that is consistent with this Act's requirements, and that does not substantially prevent the FCC from fulfilling requirements and purposes of this Act. Prohibits any service, element, feature, function, or capability that is made available for resale in any State by a Bell operating company (BOC) from being jointly marketed directly or indirectly with any interlata (local access and transport area) or long-distance telephone toll service until such BOC is authorized to provide interlata services in such State, but permits joint marketing of services acquired from a BOC by an unaffiliated provider that, with its affiliates, has in the aggregate less than two percent of the access lines installed nationwide. Authorizes the FCC to modify or waive requirements of this title for any local exchange carrier (or class or category of such carriers) that has, in the aggregate nationwide, fewer than 500,000 access lines installed, to the extent that it determines that compliance with such requirements would be unduly economically burdensome or technologically infeasible. Makes such requirements inapplicable to a rural telephone company until such company has received a bona fide request for services described in the foregoing provisions. Requires the State commission, following a bona fide request to the carrier and notice of the request to it, to determine within 120 days whether the request would be unduly economically burdensome, technologically infeasible, and consistent with specified requirements, but makes the exemption provided by this provision inapplicable if such carrier provides video programming services over its telephone exchange facilities in its telephone service area. Directs the State to establish, after making such determination, an implementation schedule for compliance with such approved bona fide request that is consistent in time and manner with FCC rules. Specifies that nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit the: (1) FCC from enforcing regulations prescribed prior to this Act's enactment in fulfilling requirements regarding equal access and interconnection to the local loop for competing providers, and regarding pricing flexibility and abolition of rate-of-return regulation, to the extent that such regulations are consistent with such requirements; and (2) State commission from enforcing regulations prescribed prior to the enactment date of this Act, or from prescribing regulations after such date in fulfilling such requirements, if such regulations are consistent with these provisions and the enforcement of such regulations has not been precluded under this Act. Prohibits a State or local legal requirement from prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide interstate or intrastate telecommunications services, with exceptions (and specifies that nothing herein shall affect the ability of a State or local government to impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with universal service provisions, requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service, protect the public safety and welfare, ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers, or the authority of a local government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers for use of the rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government); or (2) providing such services from exercising specified access and interconnection rights. Specifies that nothing in this title shall affect: (1) the ability of State officials to impose, on a nondiscriminatory basis, requirements necessary to preserve and advance universal service, to promote public safety and welfare, and to ensure the continued quality of telecommunications services, that a provider's business practices are consistent with consumer protection laws and regulations, and just and reasonable rates, provided that such requirements do not effectively prohibit any carrier or person from providing interstate or intrastate telecommunications or information services; and (2) the authority of a local government to manage the public rights-of-way or to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers for use of public rights-of-way on a nondiscriminatory basis, if the compensation required is publicly disclosed by such government. Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) preemption of State and local regulation of interstate or intrastate telecommunications services; and (2) statements of terms and conditions for access and interconnection. Establishes procedures by which a BOC may seek entry to offer interlata services.

Directs the FCC to prohibit a person or entity from obtaining any license if such license would result in such person or entity directly or indirectly owning, operating, or controlling, or having a cognizable interest in: (1) TV stations which have an aggregate national audience reach exceeding 35 percent (directs the FCC to study the operation of this section and report to the Congress on the development of competition in the TV marketplace and the need for any revisions to or elimination of this provision); or (2) two or more TV stations within the same TV market, with exceptions for multiple UHF stations and UHF-VHF combinations and for VHF-VHF combinations. Authorizes the FCC, in a proceeding to grant, renew, or authorize the assignment of any station license, to deny the application upon determining that the combination of such station and more than one other non-broadcast media of mass communication would result in an undue concentration of media voices in the respective local market. Bars the FCC from applying requirements regarding the provision of direct video programming by common carriers in any area in which there are two or more unaffiliated wireline providers of video programming services. (Sec. 303) Provides that the ban on foreign governments or their representatives holding station licenses shall not apply to licenses to mobile earth stations engaged in occasional or short-term transmissions via satellite of audio or TV program material and auxiliary signals if such transmissions are not intended for direct reception by the general public in the United States. Makes foreign ownership restrictions inapplicable to any common carrier license granted, held, or for which application is made, after this section's enactment with respect to any alien, corporation, or foreign government if: (1) the President determines that the relevant foreign country is party to an international agreement which requires the United States to provide national or most-favored-nation treatment in the grant of common carrier licenses and that not applying such restrictions would be consistent with national security and effective law enforcement; or (2) the FCC determines that not applying such restrictions would serve the public interest. Directs the FCC, in making its determination, to abide by any decision of the President regarding whether not applying such restrictions is in the public interest due to national security, law enforcement, foreign policy or trade concerns or due to the interpretation of international agreements (and, in the absence of a decision by the President, the FCC may consider, among other public interest factors, whether effective competitive opportunities are available to U.S. nationals or corporations in the applicant's home market). Sets forth provisions regarding: (1) FCC notice and determinations regarding applications requiring such determination; (2) further FCC review; (3) notification to the Congress; and (4) judicial review. (Sec. 304) Declares it to be U.S. policy to: (1) encourage broadcast TV, cable, satellite, syndication, or other video programming distributors and relevant related industries to establish a technology fund to encourage TV and electronics equipment manufacturers to facilitate the development of technology which would empower parents to block programming they deem inappropriate for their children, to report to the viewing public on the status of the development of affordable, easy to use blocking technology, and to establish and promote effective mechanisms for ensuring that users have easy and complete access to the information necessary to effectively utilize such technology; and (2) evaluate whether, not later than one year after this Act's enactment, such industry-wide procedures, standards, or other mechanisms are informing viewers regarding their options to utilize blocking technology and encouraging the development of blocking technologies. Requires the Comptroller General, no later than 18 months after this Act's enactment, to submit to the Congress an evaluation of the proliferation of new and existing blocking technology, the accessibility of information to empower viewing choices, and the consumer satisfaction with information and technological solutions. (Sec. 304 (sic)) Directs the FCC, if distributors of video programming have not taken appropriate voluntary actions within one year, to prescribe: (1) on the basis of recommendations from an advisory committee, guidelines and recommended procedures for rating video programming that contains sexual, violent, or other indecent material about which parents should be informed before it is displayed to children; and (2) rules requiring distributors of such video programming to transmit such rating to permit parents to block the display of video programming that they have determined is inappropriate for their children. Directs the FCC to require apparatus designed to receive TV signals that are manufactured, or imported for use, in the United States and that have a picture screen 13 inches or greater (measured diagonally) to be equipped with circuitry designed to enable viewers to block display of all programs with a common rating, with exceptions. Amends the Act to prohibit the shipment in interstate commerce, manufacture, assembly, or importation into the United States of any such apparatus except in accordance with rules prescribed by the FCC, except with respect to carriers transporting such an apparatus without trading it. Requires the rules prescribed by the FCC to provide for FCC oversight of the adoption of standards by industry for blocking technology and to require that all such apparatus be able to receive the rating signals which have been transmitted by way of line 21 of the vertical blanking interval and which conform to the signal and blocking specifications established by industry under the supervision of the FCC. Requires the FCC: (1) as new video technology is developed, to ensure that blocking service continues to be available to consumers; and (2) if it determines that an alternative blocking technology that enables parents to block programming based on identifying programs without ratings is available to consumers at a cost comparable to that of technology that allows parents to block programming based on common ratings, to amend its rules to require that such apparatus be equipped with either blocking technology. (Sec. 305) Revises provisions regarding license terms and renewal for the operation of a TV broadcast station. Increases to seven years (currently, five) the period for each license granted. Directs the FCC to continue a license in effect pending any hearing and final decision on an application and the disposition of a petition for rehearing. (Sec. 306) Requires the FCC to grant an application for a broadcast station license renewal if it finds that, during the preceding term of the station's license: (1) the station has served the public interest; (2) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of this Act or FCC rules and regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of this Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. Makes such provision applicable to any application for renewal pending or filed on or after this Act's enactment date. (Sec. 307) Grants the FCC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of the direct broadcast satellite service. (Sec. 308) Specifies that a ship documented under U.S. law operating in accordance with the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System provisions of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention shall not be required to be equipped with a radio telegraphy station operated by one or more radio officers or operators. Makes this section effective for each vessel upon a determination by the U.S. Coast Guard that such vessel has the equipment required to implement such System installed and operating in good working condition. (Sec. 309) Directs the FCC to promulgate regulations to prohibit restrictions that inhibit a viewer's ability to receive video programming services through signal receiving devices designed for off-the-air reception of TV broadcast signals. (Sec. 310) Includes programming of a licensee in the direct broadcast satellite service within the scope of provisions penalizing the manufacture, import, sale, or distribution of equipment that is primarily of assistance in the unauthorized decryption of satellite cable programming. (Sec. 311) Authorizes the FCC to: (1) authorize the use of private organizations for testing and certifying the compliance of devices or home electronic equipment and systems; (2) accept as prima facie evidence of such compliance the certification by any such organization; and (3) establish such qualifications and standards as it deems appropriate for such private organizations, testing, and certification.
