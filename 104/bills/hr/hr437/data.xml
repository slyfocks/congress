  <summary>1/9/1995--Introduced.
Minimum Mandatory Sentence Modification Act - Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 to modify the limitation on the applicability of mandatory minimum penalties in certain cases. Specifies that in the case of any offense (currently, specified offenses under provisions of the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act) the court shall impose a sentence pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the U.S. Sentencing Commission without regard to any statutory minimum sentence if the court finds at sentencing, after the Government has been afforded the opportunity to make a recommendation, that specified conditions apply (current law) and that the defendant had attained age 55 at the time of sentencing. Makes such provision applicable to all sentences imposed whether before, on, or after the date of the enactment of such Act. Directs the sentencing court, upon the application of any person whose sentence is governed by such provision, to modify that sentence to comply with this Act. Specifies that this Act shall not reduce the eligibility of any person for a sentence without regard to a statutory minimum sentence.</summary>
