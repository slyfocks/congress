Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to revise sequestration procedures for enforcement. Requires look-back sequestration in the last quarter of each fiscal year. Revises preview sequestration reports to include total spending (instead of deficit spending). Makes it out of order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider legislation that would result in total spending exceeding maximum permissible total spending, unless waived or suspended by a three-fifths vote of Members of each House."
