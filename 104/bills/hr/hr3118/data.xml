TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: Eligibility Reform Title II: Construction Authorization Title III: Health Care and Administration Subtitle A: Health Care Sharing and Administration Subtitle B: Care of Women Veterans Subtitle C: Readjustment Counseling and Mental Health Care Subtitle D: Other Provisions Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 - Title I: Eligibility Reform - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital care and medical services to, among others, any veteran: (1) with a compensable service-connected disability (currently, for any service-connected disability, regardless of compensation); or (2) who is unable to defray the expenses of necessary medical care and services. Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to veterans not otherwise eligible for such care and services, to furnish needed hospital, medical, and nursing home care. (Sec. 102) Makes a Vietnam-era herbicide-exposed veteran eligible for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for any disability, notwithstanding that there is insufficient medical evidence that such disability may be associated with such exposure. Makes a radiation-exposed veteran eligible for such care and services for: (1) any disease currently listed in Federal provisions which presume a relation between such disease and a veteran's disability; or (2) any disease for which the Secretary determines there is credible evidence of a positive association between the occurrence of such disease and exposure to ionizing radiation. Provides exceptions from such coverage. (Sec. 103) Repeals the requirement that veterans be eligible to receive hospital care through the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to receive surgical, dental, optometric, and podiatric services, but requires such eligibility before such veterans may receive certain prosthetic appliances, special clothing necessitated by the wearing of such appliances, and other reasonable and necessary supplies and services. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary, in managing the provision of hospital care and medical services, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment, with specified priorities relating to the degree of disability of a veteran and related factors. Requires the system to be managed to ensure the provision of timely and acceptable care to enrollees. Authorizes the Secretary to establish additional care priorities and exceptions to the special priorities where dictated by compelling medical reasons. Requires veterans to enroll in the system to be eligible for such care, but provides automatic coverage for a 12-month period following a veteran's discharge or release from active service. Requires the Secretary to design, establish, and manage Department of Veterans Affairs health care programs so as to promote cost-effective delivery of health care services in the most clinically appropriate setting. Requires the Department to maintain its capacity to provide for the specialized treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans, with at least the same capacity to provide such services as in existence on the date of enactment of this Act. Requires a compliance report from the Secretary to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees). (Sec. 105) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 and 1998 for the Department's Medical Care Account. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to establish information systems to assess, and report to the veterans' committees on: (1) the effect of this title on the demand for Department health care services by veterans; (2) any differing patterns of such demand; and (3) the extent to which the Department has met such demand. Requires the report to include certain information with respect to FY 1997 on: (1) the veterans enrolled for care at a Department medical facility who did not receive such care in the three preceding fiscal years or who applied for, but were denied, care; and (2) the number and characteristics of, and the type and extent of health care provided to, enrolled and non-enrolled veterans. Title II: Construction Authorization - Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) carry out nine specified ambulatory care addition major medical facility projects; (2) carry out eight specified environmental improvement major medical facility projects; (3) carry out seismic corrections at a Department medical center in Palo Alto, California; and (4) enter into six leases for specified medical facilities. (Sec. 203) Authorizes appropriations to the Secretary for FY 1997 and 1998 for the Construction, Major Projects, account and the Medical Care account. (Sec. 204) Replaces an annual reporting requirement regarding operational and construction plans for Department medical facilities with a requirement that the Secretary report annually to the veterans' committees: (1) regarding long-range health planning of the Department, including a five-year strategic plan for the provision of medical care to eligible veterans through coordinated networks of medical facilities; and (2) showing the current Department priorities (listing the top 20) for proposed major medical construction projects. (Sec. 205) Specifies additional information required to be included in a prospectus submitted by the Secretary to the veterans' committees in connection with proposed medical facilities, including data on demographics, projected workload and utilization, operating costs, funding priority, and alternatives to facility construction. (Sec. 206) Redefines a "major medical facility project" for purposes of provisions governing medical facility acquisition as a project involving a total expenditure of more than $4 million (currently, $3 million). Repeals a provision of the Veterans' Medical Programs Amendments of 1992 which makes inapplicable to projects for which funds were appropriated prior to the enactment of such Act a prohibition on the appropriation, obligation, or expenditure of funds for any major medical facility project unless funds for such project have been specifically authorized by law. Prohibits the Secretary from obligating funds in excess of $500,000 from the Department's Advance Planning Fund toward design or development of a major medical facility project until the Secretary reports to the veterans' committees. Title III: Health Care and Administration - Subtitle A: Health Care Sharing and Administration - Authorizes the Secretary to enter into arrangements for the exchange and mutual use of health care resources between Department health care facilities and non-Department health care providers. (Currently, such sharing is authorized only for specialized medical resources.) Makes eligible as additional parties to such agreements health care plans and insurers and any organizations, institutions, or other entities that furnish health care resources. Allows the use of other-than-competitive procedures when the health care resource required is a commercial service, or involves the use of medical equipment, space, or research. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe simplified acquisition procedures in such cases. Outlines requirements for procurements to be conducted on a sole-source basis.
