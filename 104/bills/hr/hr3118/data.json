Authorizes the Secretary, with respect to veterans not otherwise eligible for such care and services, to furnish needed hospital, medical, and nursing home care. (Sec. 102) Makes a Vietnam-era herbicide-exposed veteran eligible for hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care for any disability, notwithstanding that there is insufficient medical evidence that such disability may be associated with such exposure. Makes a radiation-exposed veteran eligible for such care and services for: (1) any disease currently listed in Federal provisions which presume a relation between such disease and a veteran's disability; or (2) any disease for which the Secretary determines there is credible evidence of a positive association between the occurrence of such disease and exposure to ionizing radiation. Provides exceptions from such coverage. (Sec. 103) Repeals the requirement that veterans be eligible to receive hospital care through the Department of Veterans Affairs in order to receive surgical, dental, optometric, and podiatric services, but requires such eligibility before such veterans may receive certain prosthetic appliances, special clothing necessitated by the wearing of such appliances, and other reasonable and necessary supplies and services. (Sec. 104) Directs the Secretary, in managing the provision of hospital care and medical services, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment, with specified priorities relating to the degree of disability of a veteran and related factors. Requires the system to be managed to ensure the provision of timely and acceptable care to enrollees. Authorizes the Secretary to establish additional care priorities and exceptions to the special priorities where dictated by compelling medical reasons. Requires veterans to enroll in the system to be eligible for such care, but provides automatic coverage for a 12-month period following a veteran's discharge or release from active service. Requires the Secretary to design, establish, and manage Department of Veterans Affairs health care programs so as to promote cost-effective delivery of health care services in the most clinically appropriate setting. Requires the Department to maintain its capacity to provide for the specialized treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans, with at least the same capacity to provide such services as in existence on the date of enactment of this Act. Requires a compliance report from the Secretary to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees (veterans' committees). (Sec. 105) Authorizes appropriations for FY 1997 and 1998 for the Department's Medical Care Account. (Sec. 106) Directs the Secretary to establish information systems to assess, and report to the veterans' committees on: (1) the effect of this title on the demand for Department health care services by veterans; (2) any differing patterns of such demand; and (3) the extent to which the Department has met such demand. Requires the report to include certain information with respect to FY 1997 on: (1) the veterans enrolled for care at a Department medical facility who did not receive such care in the three preceding fiscal years or who applied for, but were denied, care; and (2) the number and characteristics of, and the type and extent of health care provided to, enrolled and non-enrolled veterans.
