  <summary>6/22/1995--Conference report filed in House.
Amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended by the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994, to: (1) extend the current 15-State Medicare Select demonstration program under which insurers can market Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policies that are the same as other Medigap policies except that supplemental benefits are paid only if services are provided through designated providers; and (2) permit Medicare Select policies to be offered in all States, at State option, until June 30, 1998. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study that compares the health care costs, quality of care, and access to services under Medicare Select policies with those under other Medigap policies. Declares that such amendments shall remain in effect beyond the extended period unless the Secretary determines by December 31, 1997, based on the study, that as a result of such amendments: (1) there have been no savings in premium costs to Select enrollees as compared to their enrollment in Medigap policies with comparable coverage which are not Medicare Select policies; (2) there have been significant additional expenditures under the Medicare program; or (3) access to and quality of care have been significantly diminished. Directs the Comptroller General to study and report, by June 30, 1996, to the Congress on: (1) the extent to which individuals who are continuously covered under a Medigap policy are subject to medical underwriting if they change the policy under which they are covered; and (2) the options, if necessary, for modifying the Medigap insurance market to make sure that continuously insured beneficiaries are able to switch plans without medical underwriting. Requires such report to describe the potential impact on the cost and availability of Medigap policies of each option identified.</summary>
