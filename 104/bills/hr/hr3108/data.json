Authorizes an NFI or the Secretary of the Army, upon request, to undertake all necessary studies and engineering for such projects. Authorizes any NFI which has received from the Secretary a favorable recommendation for a flood control project (or separable element thereof) to carry out such project if a final environmental impact statement has been filed. Directs the Secretary to monitor any project for which a permit is granted to ensure permit compliance. Authorizes the Secretary to reimburse any NFI for the Federal share of an authorized flood control project if the Secretary: (1) approves the construction plans of the NFI; and (2) finds that such construction is economically justified and environmentally acceptable."
