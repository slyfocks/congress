  <summary>5/2/1995--Introduced.
Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to prohibit the acquisition of land within the boundaries of a specified segment of the Missouri River in Nebraska and South Dakota without the owner's consent. (Currently, limited acreage may be acquired in less than fee title without such consent if the Secretary of the Interior determines that activities are occurring or threatening to occur thereon which constitute serious damage or threat to the integrity of the river corridor, in accordance with the values for which this river was designated as a component of the national wild and scenic rivers system.)</summary>
