    "text": "Personal Investment Plan Act of 1995 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code and title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) of the Social Security Act to require covered employers to have a plan for withholding certain contributions from the wages of their eligible employees electing to participate for investment according to the individual employee's personal investment plan. Defines personal investment plan as: (1) any personal investment retirement plan restricted to certain contribution deposits in the Personal Investment Fund, established in the Treasury by this Act; or (2) any individual retirement plan restricted to certain contribution deposits and administered or issued by a bank. Requires the Personal Investment Fund to be governed by a Personal Investment Fund Board under a system similar to the Thrift Savings Program for Federal employees. Covers self-employed individuals. Specifies reduced social security tax rates for participating employees and self-employed individuals. Sets forth civil penalties for employers who fail to establish a personal investment payroll deduction plan or observe certain requirements with respect to it. Provides for adjustments to primary insurance amounts under the OASDI program."
