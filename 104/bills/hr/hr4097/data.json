Revises provisions regarding activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors to: (1) provide specified penalties for anyone who knowingly possesses any book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, or other material which contains three or more visual depictions that meet specified requirements; and (2) increase penalties for, and the scope of the prohibition regarding, such activities."
