TABLE OF CONTENTS: Title I: General Provisions Title II: Emission Reduction Credits Title III: Tax Incentives Title IV: Revision of Purchase Mandates Title V: Federal Transit Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles Title VI: Government Contract Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles Title VII: Research, Development, and Demonstration Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles Natural Gas Vehicle Incentives Act of 1996 - Title I: General Provisions - Sets forth the findings of Congress with respect to increased use of domestic natural gas as a transportation fuel. Title II: Emission Reduction Credits - Amends the Clean Air Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish an emission reduction credit program for natural gas vehicles, Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV)-certified alternative fuel vehicles, and fueling infrastructure. Title III: Tax Incentives - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish natural gas vehicle property credits for any of the following property placed in service during the taxable year: (1) natural gas vehicles (50 percent of the cost); (2) fueling stations (the lesser of $25,000 or ten percent of the cost); and (3) transportation fuel (25 cents per gallon of liquefied natural gas or per gasoline gallon equivalent of compressed natural gas). (Sec. 302) Imposes an excise tax of 3.54 cents per gallon on liquefied natural gas sold for use or used as motor vehicle or motorboat fuel unless there was a taxable sale of such gas. (Sec. 303) Provides for shorter depreciation recovery periods for natural gas vehicles (three years) and refueling property (seven years). Title IV: Revision of Purchase Mandates - Declares the national policy to be that: (1) a viable, sustainable market for natural gas and other low emission vehicles requires cooperative efforts by and among fleet operators and other users, fuel providers, and vehicle manufacturers; (2) government mandates requiring private sector fleet purchases do not support such cooperative efforts; (3) the low emission vehicle market should be based on voluntary, economically sound decisions; and (4) market-oriented incentives can provide an appropriate and effective means for developing a self-sustaining market for such vehicles and fuels. (Sec. 402) Amends the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to repeal private fleet mandates. Sets forth sunset provisions to end the fuel provider mandate and the State fleet mandate. Title V: Federal Transit Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Amends Federal transportation law to require metropolitan mass transportation planning organizations, in developing plans, to consider opportunities to stimulate the use of natural gas vehicles and ULEV-certified alternative fueled vehicles and the installation of a fueling infrastructure to support such vehicles. (Sec. 504) Declares that research and investigations for which non-profit institutions of higher learning may receive Department of Transportation grants include the relationship between environmental policy and transportation policy, particularly the potential applications for natural gas vehicles and ULEV-certified alternative fueled vehicles in urban settings. (Sec. 505) Requires any Federal grant for a mass transportation project that involves acquiring buses powered by natural gas, or any ULEV-certified alternative fueled bus, and all related fueling property or equipment, to cover at least 90 percent of the project cost. Title VI: Government Contract Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Amends Federal law for Armed Services acquisitions and the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to direct the Secretary of Defense and Federal civilian agencies, respectively, to give a preference in procurement contracts to contractors and subcontractors using motor vehicles that: (1) operate on natural gas; or (2) operate on alternative fuel and meet the ULEV standard. Title VII: Research, Development, and Demonstration Incentives for Natural Gas Vehicles - Directs the Secretary of Energy to conduct a five-year program of natural gas vehicle research, development, and demonstration, including specified activities.</summary>
