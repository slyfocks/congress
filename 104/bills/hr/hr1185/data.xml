  <summary>3/9/1995--Introduced.
Federal Retirement Reform Act of 1995 - Amends provisions regarding the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to increase the percentages to be deducted from basic pay of CSRS participants for service after December 31, 1995. Limits Government contributions under CSRS provisions for service after 1995 to the percentage applicable in 1995. Makes individual CSRS contributions for military or volunteer service after 1995 conform to percentages set under this Act. Makes conforming amendments to related provisions regarding the Federal Employees' Retirement System. Treats postal officers and employees as if the amendments under this Act regarding deductions had not been enacted for purposes of applying retirement provisions. Establishes special rules relating to average pay such that CSRS or FERS annuity or survivor annuity eligibility based on separations occurring after 1995 shall reflect the largest annual rate resulting from averaging rates of basic pay over: (1) three consecutive years ("high three") for service performed before 1996; (2) four consecutive years ("high four") for service performed during 1996; and (3) five consecutive years ("high five") for service performed after 1996. (Current law provides for the "high three" calculation.)</summary>
