Revises the definition of \"contractual relationship,\" for purposes of liability under CERCLA, to exclude transfers of property from an exempt redevelopment entity described in this Act after the disposal or placement of a hazardous substance if the defendant has not engaged in: (1) a response action or disposal of a hazardous substance at the facility; or (2) the generation of a hazardous substance disposed of at the facility."
