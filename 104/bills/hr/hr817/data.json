Permits the Bureau of Land Management to serve as leasing agents of the Secretary. Conditions the lease of lands in an oil shale reserve upon payment of a royalty rate equivalent to that prevailing for similar leases in the State in which the reserve is located. Authorizes the Secretary to require that all or a portion of the Federal share of the royalty be paid in the form of petroleum. Mandates that 50 percent of the proceeds received from royalty and other payments made by a lessee be paid to the State within which the leased lands are located. Authorizes the Secretary to transfer existing Federal equipment inside a naval oil shale reserve if the lessee assumes responsibility for it."
