  <summary>6/27/1996--Introduced.
Declares that upon Federal receipt of the document "To Strengthen Michigan Families" relating to a specified demonstration project conducted by the State of Michigan: (1) the appropriate Federal official is deemed to have waived the compliance requirements for any Federal entitlement program specified in such document; and (2) certain implementation costs which would not otherwise be included as program expenditures shall be regarded as project expenditures during the testing period to the extent they do not exceed what would have been expended on the programs involved in the absence of the demonstration project. Provides that this Act shall not be construed to affect certain other waivers granted to the State of Michigan. Permits the State to elect to participate in the same programs as modified by any subsequent legislation.</summary>
