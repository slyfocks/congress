Prohibits a registrant of an antimicrobial pesticide from changing the label or labeling statements required under FIFRA or by regulation without the approval of the Administrator, but allows labeling or labeling alteration that is truthful and not misleading if it is unrelated to such requirements. Exempts from applicability of FIFRA storage, disposal, transportation, and recall requirements household and similarly formulated industrial and institutional disinfectant and sanitizer products not otherwise subject to regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Directs the Administrator to: (1) share data and information and coordinate and synchronize data requests whenever data in support of a pesticide registration is requested by one or more State or Federal agencies; and (2) develop and implement procedures for such coordination to reduce burdens and avoid unnecessary repetition and redundancy."
