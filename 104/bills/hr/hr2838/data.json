    "text": "Public Debt Relief Act of 1995 - Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to allow a State to exercise flow control authority over solid waste if, on or before January 1, 1984, the State: (1) adopted regulations under a State law that required or directed the transportation, management, or disposal of such waste from residential, commercial, institutional, or industrial sources to specifically identified waste management facilities and applied those regulations to every political subdivision; and (2) subjected the facilities to the jurisdiction of a State public utilities commission. Allows a State or political subdivision of the State meeting the requirements of this Act to exercise flow control authority over all classes and categories of solid waste that were subject to flow control by the State or subdivision on May 16, 1994, by directing it from any existing waste management facility to any other such facility, existing or proposed. Sets limitations on the duration of authority under this Act according to the length of a revenue or general obligation bond issued to finance waste management facilities."
