  <summary>12/6/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) all decisions regarding the operations of the U.S. armed forces in the former Yugoslavia should reflect the judgment of U.S. military commanders; (2) the President should direct the Secretary of Defense to respond immediately and completely to the requests made by the Commander of those forces for resources and other support necessary to carry out the mission of enforcing the peace agreement; and (3) such mission should not be expanded in scope or extended beyond the one-year deadline imposed by the President unless the President determines, in consultation with the Congress, that such action is necessary to protect U.S. armed forces in the former Yugoslavia or vital national security interests.</summary>
