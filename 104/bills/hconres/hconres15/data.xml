  <summary>1/20/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) steps should be taken to examine whether a disparity exists between benefits available to Members of Congress and those offered to Federal employees, with the intent of discovering whether retirement benefits available to Members are more generous than those afforded to other employees; (2) hearings should be conducted by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight in order to review such findings; (3) legislation should be drafted that resolves such differences by removing any privileges in Federal retirement programs afforded exclusively to Members; and (4) action should be taken on this matter within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress.</summary>
