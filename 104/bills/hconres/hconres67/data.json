Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) any reductions in taxes should benefit working families and stimulate savings, investment, job creation, and economic growth; (2) the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, in response to section 105 provisions, should provide that no more than 20 percent of the savings be achieved in commodity programs; (3) a special bipartisan commission should study the Medicare system; (4) in meeting aggregates and levels in this resolution, the impact of any Medicaid reforms should be considered with respect to the health of children and low-income pregnant women; and (5) the aggregates and functional levels in this budget resolution assume that the Federal Government will establish a uniform accounting system, very wealthy individuals are not able to reduce or avoid taxes by relinquishing their citizenship, full funding should be provided for research on brain diseases, the essential air service program to small communities should continue to receive full funding, funds will be available to the States to implement the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, and a temporary nonpartisan commission should be established to make recommendations concerning the Consumer Price Index. Requires the House of Representatives to re-examine budget reductions for agricultural programs in the Department of Agriculture for FY 1999 and 2000 unless specified conditions are met concerning land values, the Endangered Species Act, tax relief for producers, trade embargoes, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) baseline budgeting should be replaced with a form of budgeting that requires full justification and analysis of budget proposals and maximizes congressional accountability for public spending; (2) a high-level commission should be convened to study and make recommendations with respect to the Federal civil and military retirement systems; (3) rule XLIX of the Rules of the House of Representatives (the Gephardt rule) should be repealed; and (4) the Congress should study alternative approaches to budgeting for emergencies, including establishing contingency funds to pay for emergencies."
