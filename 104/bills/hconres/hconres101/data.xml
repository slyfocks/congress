  <summary>9/14/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that each U.S. court currently having in force any decree or other order respecting school desegregation should reconsider any such order that has been in effect for more than three years to determine whether the means chosen to achieve desegregation are currently effective in the light of any changed facts and to make any modifications necessary, consistent with serving the educational needs of the children and a rational allocation of the taxpayers' money.</summary>
