  <summary>10/13/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that: (1) the home field advantage for the two Major League Baseball league championship series should go to the team having a better record; and (2) if two teams have identical records, home field advantage should be determined by a head-to-head match-up between those two teams during the regular season.</summary>
