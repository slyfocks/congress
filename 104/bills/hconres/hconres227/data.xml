  <summary>9/27/1996--Introduced.
Urges the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) technology program to: (1) ensure that Federal agencies are not duplicating one another's work; (2) develop a nationwide database to provide information on law enforcement equipment and technologies to State and local law enforcement agencies; (3) promote testing and evaluation of law enforcement equipment and technologies and make available a list of product failures and short-comings; (4) promote establishment of standards for such equipment and technologies; (5) maintain the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center system as the main clearinghouse for the research, development, testing, evaluation, and dissemination of law enforcement technologies and standards; and (6) develop a program to improve forensics technology and work with the Nation's crime labs. Calls for NIJ: (1) to be designated as the law enforcement partner in surplus Federal property and equipment transfer programs; (2) if working with the private sector, to be authorized to waive Government patent rights and assign exclusive use of a license; and (3) to be exempted from many of the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</summary>
