  <summary>9/26/1996--Passed House amended.
Recognizes and reaffirms the value of ties between the United States and the South Pacific region. Notes the need to continue to support the efforts of the countries of the region to enhance the sustainable development of the more fragile island economies and their integration into the regional economy, while helping to ensure the protection of the region's unique ecosystems. Recognizes the efforts of the East-West Center and Pacific Islands Conference in this regard. Commends the South Pacific Commission for managerial and organizational reform and recognizes the important role the U.S. financial contribution to, and participation in, the organization makes in assisting it to realize the gradual economic self-sufficiency of all of its members. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment as a member of the Commission, a participant in the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, and a member of the post-forum dialogue partnership with the South Pacific Forum.</summary>
