  <summary>7/27/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that President Clinton's decision to recognize the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was in violation of the principles of the United States and that he should revoke such recognition until such time as the Hanoi regime: (1) fully cooperates in determining the status of all personnel who remain not accounted for as a result of service in the armed forces or other Federal Government service during the Vietnam era; and (2) adopts a free and democratic government that respects human rights and observes internationally recognized norms of behavior.</summary>
