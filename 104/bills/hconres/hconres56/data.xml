  <summary>4/4/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that any legislation enacted to reform the health care delivery system of the United States should: (1) ensure that the unique needs of rural residents are addressed and solved, that people who live in rural areas receive the same quality health care as others, and that rural health care services are coordinated effectively with existing systems and programs of medical, income, residential, and social support at the Federal, State, and local levels; (2) increase funding for programs that train health care professionals for rural practice and provide incentives for them to practice in rural areas, increase coordination among transportation programs, and increase funding to rural transit programs and to emergency medical services; and (3) encourage telecommunications consortia and other measures to ensure rural access to emerging medical technologies.</summary>
