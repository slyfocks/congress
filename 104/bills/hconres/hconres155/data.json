Calls for: (1) the United States to support the legitimate claims of the Kosovan people to determine their political future; (2) the return of international observers to Kosova as soon as possible; (3) the elected Government of Kosova to be permitted to meet and exercise its legitimate mandate as elected representatives of the Kosovan people; and (4) the reinstatement of all individuals whose employment was terminated on the basis of their ethnicity. Declares that the Kosovan education system should be reopened to all residents of Kosova regardless of ethnicity and the majority ethnic Albanian population should be allowed to educate its youth in its native tongue. Commends the establishment of a United States Information Agency cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova. Calls for the President to appoint a special envoy to aid in negotiating a resolution to the crisis in Kosova."
