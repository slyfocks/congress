  <summary>9/4/1996--Passed House amended.
Congratulates Ukraine for the successful conduct of free and fair elections for the presidency and parliament and for the adoption of a new constitution. Calls for the President and Parliament of Ukraine to focus their efforts on passing legislation needed to implement such constitution. Urges the Government of Ukraine to: (1) continue efforts to ensure the rights of all citizens; (2) make its first priority the dismantling of the remaining socialist sectors of its economy; (3) make the necessary institutional and legal reforms to make changes that build a positive climate for foreign investment; (4) make it a priority to build the institutional capacity and legal framework needed to fight crime and corruption effectively in a democratic environment; (5) continue its cooperative efforts with the G-7 group of States to shut down the nuclear reactors at Chernobyl; and (6) oppose the emergence of any political or military organization with the potential to promote the reintegration of the states of the former Soviet Union. Calls upon the President of the United States to: (1) support continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine for its political and economic reforms, the safe and secure dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction, increased safety of operation of its civilian nuclear reactors, the establishment of rule of law, criminal justice and law enforcement training, and promotion of trade and investment (provides that such assistance should leverage private-sector involvement as much as possible); (2) urge that the Government of the Russian Federation offer Ukraine its promised highest possible cooperation, recognizing Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and refraining from economic coercion; (3) ensure that Ukraine's national security interests are fully considered in any review of European security arrangements and understandings; (4) support continued U.S. security assistance for Ukraine; and (5) ensure continued U.S. efforts to assist Ukraine in its accession to the World Trade Organization and ensure exploitation of the potential for aerospace and space cooperation between Ukraine and the United States. Calls for the United States to continue to support the Ukrainian people in their struggle to bring peace, prosperity, and democracy to Ukraine and to the other independent states of the former Soviet Union.</summary>
