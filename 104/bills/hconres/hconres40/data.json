Endorses the steps taken by President Clinton to demonstrate U.S. opposition to the annulment of the June 1993 election and encourages additional measures to encourage the restoration of democratic and civilian rule in Nigeria. Condemns the arrests by the Nigerian military of political leaders and democracy advocates and restrictions on freedom of expression. Urges General Abacha and the provisional ruling council in Nigeria to: (1) restore freedom of the press, respect human rights, and restore the independence and authority of the judiciary; (2) release political leaders and human rights activists who have been arrested or detained; (3) set up a rapid timetable for the restoration of civilian and democratic rule; and (4) positively respond to U.S. and international efforts to encourage the restoration of democracy."
