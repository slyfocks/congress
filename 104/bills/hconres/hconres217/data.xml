  <summary>9/24/1996--Introduced.
Calls for the United States to: (1) continue its leadership role within the international community in seeking a solution to the problems of the ethnic groups of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; (2) continue to oppose lifting the "outer wall of sanctions" against Yugoslavia until the situation of the Bosniac people of the Sanjak region (along with that of other ethnic groups) is substantially improved; and (3) raise the issue of human rights violations in the Sanjak region with Yugoslavia at every opportunity. Calls for the Yugoslav Government to: (1) restore political freedom in such region, end persecution of political leaders, and guarantee the safe return of those Bosniac people forced to leave the region; and (2) permit the return of a permanent mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the Sanjak region to monitor and report on developments and to help establish the necessary conditions for observing elections.</summary>
