Calls for the Yugoslav Government to: (1) restore political freedom in such region, end persecution of political leaders, and guarantee the safe return of those Bosniac people forced to leave the region; and (2) permit the return of a permanent mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to the Sanjak region to monitor and report on developments and to help establish the necessary conditions for observing elections."
