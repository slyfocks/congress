  <summary>2/3/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the nutritional programs under the Older Americans Act: (1) provide essential assistance to senior citizens; (2) would have their effectiveness severely compromised by removal from such Act; and (3) would have their viability threatened by the reduction of the total funds available and the combination of senior nutrition with means-tested public assistance programs.</summary>
