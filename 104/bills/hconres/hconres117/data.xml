  <summary>12/12/1995--Passed House amended.
Urges: (1) the immediate and unconditional release of Wei Jingsheng; and (2) if he is not immediately released, that he be afforded all internationally recognized human rights and that his trial be open to the domestic and foreign press, diplomatic observers, and international human rights monitors; and (3) the State Department to make his release and the protection of his rights a particularly important objective in relations with the Government of China and to raise these issues in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum. Recognizes that the efforts of Wei Jingsheng once again merit careful consideration for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.</summary>
