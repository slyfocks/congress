  <summary>4/3/1995--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Congress that the President: (1) should not have granted diplomatic recognition to the Skopje regime that insists on using the Greek name "Macedonia" in the name of its country, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and (2) should reconsider this decision and withdraw diplomatic recognition and any consideration of financial assistance to the Skopje regime until such time as it renounces its use of that name, removes objectionable language in its constitution, removes symbols which imply territorial expansion, ceases propaganda against Greece, and adheres fully to the norms and principles of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.</summary>
