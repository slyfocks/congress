  <summary>1/4/1995--Introduced.
Constitutional Amendment - Denies enforceability against any State or local government of: (1) any obligation imposed upon such government by or pursuant to a Federal law that becomes effective after the ratification of this amendment unless the Federal Government provides the funds needed to pay compliance costs; and (2) any condition similarly imposed upon the receipt of Federal assistance by such a government unless it is directly and substantially related to the specific subject matter of the assistance. Allows waiver of such denial by a two-thirds recorded roll call vote of each House of Congress only if such obligations or conditions are specifically identified and imposed by a single, specified Act of Congress containing no other matter. Provides for judicial review, but disallows as a judicial remedy any order or ruling that the Federal Government provide a State or local government with the funds needed to pay its compliance costs.</summary>
