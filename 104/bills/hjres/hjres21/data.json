    "text": "Constitutional Amendment - Directs the President, beginning with FY 1997 or the first fiscal year after ratification, whichever is later, to submit a budget of revenues and outlays to Congress. Requires the Congress to adopt a budget that reduces the deficit existing the year prior to ratification by not less than 16.7 percent per year in order to balance the budget within six fiscal years. Requires a balanced budget by the seventh year after ratification. Requires, beginning with the seventh year, that revenues exceed outlays in order to provide for the reduction of the outstanding gross Federal debt. Requires the reduction to amortize the debt over the next 24 years in order to repay the entire debt by the end of the 30th year after ratification. Allows the waiver of aforementioned requirements when a declaration of war is in effect. Prohibits a bill that increases revenues from becoming law unless approved by a majority roll call vote in both Houses. Directs the Congress to review revenues on a quarterly basis and make adjustments to comply with this Act."
