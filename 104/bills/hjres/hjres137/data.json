Removes provisions of that law prohibiting distributions and grants in FY 1996 for programs that had high initial rates of operation or complete distribution of funding at the beginning of FY 1995. Mandates compensation at standard rates for any U.S. or District of Columbia officer or employee furloughed because of a lapse in appropriations after December 15, 1995. Ratifies certain types of obligations incurred in anticipation of the appropriations made and authority granted by this resolution."
