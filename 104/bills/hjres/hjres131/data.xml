Amends a specified Federal law making continuing appropriations to extend the specific termination date of appropriations and authority under that Act to January 26, 1996 (currently, December 15, 1995). Prohibits making, during FY 1996, an adjustment of compensation elements of members of the uniformed services otherwise mandated by specified Federal law. Increases the rates of basic pay, basic allowance for subsistence, and basic allowance for quarters of such members by specified percentages. Makes the FY 1996 increase in military retired pay first payable for the month of March 1996. Mandates and authorizes transfer from other funds available to the Department of Defense sums as necessary to carry out this paragraph.</summary>
