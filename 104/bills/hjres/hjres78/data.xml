  <summary>3/12/1996--Passed House amended.
Gives the consent of the Congress to certain additional powers conferred on the Bi-State Development Agency of the Compact Between Missouri and Illinois. (Such powers are enforcement authority for the Agency, which operates the mass transit system in the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area, to enact rules and regulations governing fare evasion and other conduct, and to appoint or employ a security force.) Makes such powers take effect on January 1, 1995. Applies to such additional powers the Joint Resolution of August 31, 1950, which consented to the compact establishing the Agency, as if they were conferred under such compact. Reserves the right to: (1) amend this joint resolution; and (2) require Agency disclosure and furnishing of appropriate information or data.</summary>
