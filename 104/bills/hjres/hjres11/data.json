Prohibits the people of the United States from proposing amendments to the Constitution. Sets forth provisions relating to: (1) the signed petition containing the text of the proposed law; (2) presidential certification of the validity of the signatures on such petition; and (3) placing the petition on the ballot at the next general election held for choosing Members of the House of Representatives. Requires the proposed law to be enacted upon receiving a majority of the number of electoral votes. Establishes guidelines for determining the number of electoral votes for each State (including the District of Columbia). Provides that such enacted law shall be the same as any other Federal law, except that any law to repeal or amend such enacted law within two years after its effective date must receive an affirmative roll call vote of two-thirds of the Members of each House. Prohibits the people from enacting a law that the Constitution forbids the Congress to enact."
