Prohibits a bill to increase receipts from becoming law unless approved by a three-fifths majority in each House. Directs the President to submit a balanced budget. Waives these provisions when a declaration of war is in effect or when the United States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security. Sets a permanent limit on the amount of Federal public debt, prohibiting any increase unless legislation enacted by a three-fifths majority of both Houses becomes law."
